So, what seems to be the problem today. \nPatient: Well, I've had pain in this right knee for a long time. \nDoctor: Have you been treated for this before? \nPatient: Yes, and I've been diagnosed with, um, chondromalacia. \nDoctor: How have you been treated so far? \nPatient: I've taken antiinflammatories, rested, changed my activities, all of that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: No, none at all. \nDoctor: Have you discussed surgery with anyone before. \nPatient: No, nobody's said anything yet. \nDoctor: Well, I think you'd be a good candidate for an arthroscopy lateral release and tubercle transfer. \nPatient: What will the surgery do?\nDoctor: This will help take some stress off of the knee joint. It should help you feel a lot better. \nPatient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, you'll be relieved to know that it's less than one percent. We use prophylactic antibiotics the entire time. \nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Okay, yes. I agree, we should do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.

Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night.

When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning.

Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night.

Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

What brings you to the emergency room? \nPatient: I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \nDoctor: Which side left or right?\nPatient: I think its left. \nDoctor: For how long?\nPatient: I guess over the past year.

At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area.

I couldn't do the entire exam because the pain might be too much for him.\nGuest_family: Thank you so much for your help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.<|eot_id|>"}

I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}

The pain started almost instantly. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it? \nPatient: I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable. \nDoctor: Is the pain localized to one area? \nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body? \nPatient: Nope.  \nDoctor: Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all? \nPatient: Not yet. \nDoctor: Any back pain?  \nPatient: Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs. \nDoctor: Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain? \nPatient: No, no pins and needles. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing stiffness in your back? \nPatient: The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.  \nDoctor: Has it impacted your sleep at all? \nPatient: Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now. \nDoctor: This accident sure did a number on you. \nPatient: No kidding. \nDoctor: You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? \nPatient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. \nDoctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, correct. \nDoctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? \nPatient: A little bit, but not much. \nDoctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? \nPatient: It's stayed more or less the same. \nDoctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? \nPatient: Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.<|eot_id|>"}

I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. \nGuest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?\nDoctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.\nGuest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How do you get the risk so low? \nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? \nDoctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. \nGuest_family: Okay. Let's do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

My asthma has been acting up. \nDoctor: Oh no. How long has this been going on? \nPatient: For the past three months. I've been using my inhaler every day. I used to use it every now and again. This is definitely new for me. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma? \nPatient: Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too. \nDoctor: Did the Flonase or Advair help at all? \nPatient: I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts. \nDoctor: How so? \nPatient: I noticed that it became more itchy as a result. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.  \nPatient: Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody.  \nDoctor: Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle? \nPatient: Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding. \nDoctor: Are your cycles generally regular? \nPatient: For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end. \nDoctor: Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Have you had any other medical troubles recently? \nPatient: I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it. \nDoctor: Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine? \nPatient: Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it. \nDoctor: Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like? \nPatient: Nothing now.  \nDoctor: Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently? \nPatient: No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again. \nDoctor: I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see? \nPatient: Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \nDoctor: That would be great. Thank you. Let me write down our fax number for you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 42-year-old white female who comes in today for a complete physical and follow up on asthma.  She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}
