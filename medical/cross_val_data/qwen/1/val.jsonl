There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. \nGuest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. \nGuest_family: Yes, we'd like to do the procedure.

Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.

Do I also need to get blood work done?\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \nDoctor: That would be great. Thank you. Let me write down our fax number for you.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThis is a 42-year-old white female who comes in today for a complete physical and follow up on asthma.  She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|im_end|>\n"}

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|im_end|>\n"}

Well, he's about five and a half now, and he broke both the bones in his forearm in September of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did the fracture heal? Generally, children heal very well. \nGuest_family: Well, yes, until he also rebroke it about a month ago. \nDoctor: Yes, I see now, there's an ulnar nail pretty prominently visible under the skin, did he have surgery for this? \nGuest_family: Yes, about a month ago now. Should we remove the nail?\nDoctor: We'll have to, even though its early.\nGuest_family: What will we do after the nail is removed? \nDoctor: After that, we'll put him back in a cast for about another three weeks. We'll evaluate him and see how he's doing.  \nGuest_family: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks. I have not seen anything bad happen before.\nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.

The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.

Patient: Sure. \nDoctor: So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months. \nPatient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results. \nDoctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like? \nPatient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed? \nPatient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up. \nDoctor: How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home? \nPatient: I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.\nDoctor: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? \nPatient: Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache. \nDoctor: Do you snore? \nPatient: I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep. \nDoctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep? \nPatient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night. \nDoctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore? \nPatient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.\nDoctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime? \nPatient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that.

I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago. \nDoctor: If that was your maximum how is your weight now? \nPatient: Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds. \nDoctor: So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel. \nPatient: That sounds right.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient presented initially to the Pulmonary Clinic with dyspnea on minimal exertion.

In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results. The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks. During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours. The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner. She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.  Since that time, her weight is down by approximately 30 pounds. The patient is managed in Outpatient Psychiatry and at her Maintenance Clinic.  She takes methadone, trazodone, and Seroquel.<|im_end|>\n"}

I have a workers comp claim open.\nDoctor: Your pain came back while working there, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: Do you remember when your last appointment here was? \nPatient: Um, yes, it was on April twelfth two thousand five. \nDoctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit? \nPatient: Um, I'd say it was an eight out of ten. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicine for this? \nPatient: Um, I had a Medrol Dosepak prescribed at my last visit. \nDoctor: How did your pain respond to the Dosepak? \nPatient: It took it down to about a four or five out of ten. \nDoctor: Can you point to me where the pain is, sir? \nPatient: Yes, it's right here. \nDoctor: This band right here? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the spot. \nDoctor: Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum.

Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.<|im_end|>\n"}
