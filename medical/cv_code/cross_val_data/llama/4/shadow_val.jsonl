I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. \nGuest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?\nDoctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.\nGuest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How do you get the risk so low? \nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? \nDoctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. \nGuest_family: Okay. Let's do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.<|eot_id|>"}

What medical conditions do you have? \nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}

I've had this pain in my left shoulder and neck for the last year and a half.\nDoctor: I see, have these symptoms been persistent for the last year and a half? Or do they come and go?\nPatient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.\nDoctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?\nPatient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. \nDoctor: Have these symptoms progressed? \nPatient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. \nDoctor: How did your P C P handle this?\nPatient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. \nDoctor: Do you remember the results of that study?\nPatient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.\nDoctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? \nPatient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. \nDoctor: Did you have any other imagine done? \nPatient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. \nDoctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? \nPatient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. \nDoctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?\nPatient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse. \nDoctor: Okay, going back to the workouts you were doing, are you sure you can't remember anything that would have set this pain off? \nPatient: No, nothing there. \nDoctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?\nPatient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. \nDoctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?\nPatient: No, honestly every position makes it hurt.\nDoctor: Okay, and we've already done two M R I s of the neck, and I've talked about those with you, correct?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I saw another surgeon who wanted to do, um, a decompression procedure. \nDoctor: Do you want to go forward with the surgery?\nPatient: No, not really.

In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

My husband, he gives me some sugar, three teaspoons, and then it helps a little bit but not completely. \nDoctor: So, is your weakness like overall in your legs or it is at any single point? \nPatient: It's overall.

She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.

It should help you feel a lot better. \nPatient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, you'll be relieved to know that it's less than one percent.

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.

These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.

Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. \nDoctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? \nPatient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. \nDoctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. \nDoctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

Right.\nDoctor: Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? \nPatient: It's been about ten days now. \nDoctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? \nPatient: No, they keep getting worse. \nDoctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? \nPatient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. \nDoctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? \nPatient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. \nDoctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? \nPatient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. \nDoctor: Did you drive yourself? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: How did the antiinflammatories work? \nPatient: Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner. \nDoctor: Was there any leg numbness? \nPatient: Yes. Since December eleventh. \nDoctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.  \nDoctor: What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? \nPatient: He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong. He recommended I follow up at U I H C. The imaging was on my L S Spine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 75y/o RHM presented with a 10 day h/o progressively worsening LBP. The LBP started on 12/3/95; began radiating down the RLE, on 12/6/95; then down the LLE, on 12/9/95. By 12/10/95, he found it difficult to walk. On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95. He was evaluated locally and an L-S-Spine CT scan and L-S Spine X-rays were \"negative.\" He was then referred to UIHC.<|eot_id|>"}

We put on some bacitracin ointment, and it almost healed up. But today I noticed that another small blister on her head. It really scared me, and I did not want to take any chance. That's why I reached out to the Infectious Disease center. I know it is private. But still, I don't want to take any chance with my baby's health. I called the center directly and they asked me to come to the hospital. \nDoctor: You did good. I will start the treatment. How are her eating and sleeping habits?\nGuest_family: She hasn't missed any of her meals. She is taking around two ounces of milk in every feed. I don't think I have any issues with her eating or sleeping. \nDoctor: Did she have any fever?\nGuest_family: Not that I noticed. \nDoctor: Has she been lethargic or crying more than normal?\nGuest_family: No. \nDoctor: Any other changes in her daily routine that you might have noticed?\nGuest_family: No, I didn't notice any changes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 14-day-old was seen by private doctor because of blister.

I know I have a fracture in my lower back. \nDoctor: How have you been managing this? \nPatient: Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement?\nPatient: Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain.  \nDoctor: This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete. \nPatient: What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain. \nDoctor: I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. \nPatient: What's that? \nDoctor: It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. \nPatient: Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?\nDoctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. \nPatient: How is this possible? \nDoctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. \nPatient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. \nPatient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain. \nDoctor: Awesome, I agree.

She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve.  Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing.  The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  She does complain of back pain.  She has been wearing a back brace and corset.  She does not have weakness.<|eot_id|>"}
