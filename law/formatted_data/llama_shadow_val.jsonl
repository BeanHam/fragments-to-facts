On this appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of his plea allocution and asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, neither contention is preserved for our review (see People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Green, 17 AD3d 780, 781 [2005]). Furthermore, and contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion here, \u201chis factual recitation during the plea colloquy did not negate an essential element of the crime or cast significant doubt as to his guilt and, therefore, the exception to the preservation rule is not applicable\u201d (People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]).\nMoreover, were we to consider defendant\u2019s arguments, we would find them to be without merit. A police search of the apartment that defendant was in at the time of his arrest revealed over two grams of cocaine, two digital scales for weighing and measuring cocaine, multiple glassine envelopes used for packaging cocaine and a large quantity of cash. Although defendant, claiming to be a mere visitor on the premises, initially denied involvement, he ultimately admitted, during his plea colloquy, to possession of the narcotics for his \u201cfuture use and control.\u201d A review of that same colloquy, meanwhile, underscores defendant\u2019s familiarity with the criminal justice system, as he repeatedly attempted to negotiate for a lesser sentence while questioning County Court regarding the possibility of confinement in a drug rehabilitation facility as opposed to state prison. The record is clear, nevertheless, that County Court fully apprised defendant of his rights and of the consequences of his plea prior to accepting it and that the plea was voluntarily entered (see People v Mitchetti, 13 AD 3d 673, 674 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 766 [2005]).\nDefendant\u2019s contention regarding the effectiveness of his counsel, who negotiated an advantageous plea agreement on his behalf, is similarly unpersuasive (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 977 [2006]).\nCardona, EJ., Mercure, Crew III and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

The defendant's appeals regarding the sufficiency of his plea allocution and ineffective assistance of counsel were not preserved for review because he did not move to withdraw his plea. Additionally, the court found that the plea was made voluntarily and that the defendant's claims lacked merit, as he had acknowledged possession of the narcotics during his plea colloquy.<|eot_id|>"}

The appeal brings up for review the denial, without a hearing, of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification testimony.\nOrdered that the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, to resettle the transcript of the sentence minutes, and the appeal is held in abeyance in the interim. The County Court, Rockland County, is to file the resettled transcript of the sentence minutes with all convenient speed.\nThe transcript of the sentence minutes indicates that the defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of three to six years imprisonment on his conviction for assault in the second degree. However, apparently due to a scrivener\u2019s error, the order of commitment to the State Department of Correctional Services sets forth the sentence as an indeterminate term of three and one-half to seven years imprisonment. In light of the foregoing discrepancy, the matter must be remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, to resettle the transcript of the sentence minutes to reflect the sentence actually imposed by the court prior to appellate review of the issues raised (see, People v Locke, 154 AD2d 622).

Judgment affirmed. The appellant and a eodefendant were indicted by a 71-count indictment which charged them with feloniously selling a .narcotic drug (counts 1-14); selling a narcotic drug in violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law (counts 15-28); selling a drug in violation of section 6804 (subd. 3, par. m) of the Education Law (counts 29-49); selling a drug in violation of section 6804 (subd. 3, par. k) of the Education Law (counts 50-70); and failure to keep records in violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law (count 71). Count 13 accused the defendants of feloniously selling a narcotic drug in that they peddled and sold \u201ca quantity of a narcotic drug, to wit, a quantity of Robitussin AC with Codeine in quantities of more than four fluid ounces to one person at one time, contrary to the Public Health Law During trial, appellant pled guilty to the attempted felonious selling of a narcotic drug under count 13, in satisfaction of the indictment. The codefendant made a similar plea to count 12, which was similar to count 13. At sentencing both defendants amended their guilty pleas to include pleas of guilty to the 71st count, which charged them with the misdemeanor of violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law in that they, \u201c between, on or about the 1st day of April, 1964 and on or about the 11th day of June, 1964, failed to keep records of all narcotic drugs received and disposed of by them, to wit, medicinal preparations containing Codeine were sold and all sales were not recorded as required by the Public Health Law, Section 3333, subdivision 3 \u201d. The court sentenced the appellant on the felony count, count 13, to a term of 2% to 5 years and suspended the execution of the sentence. On the misdemeanor count, count 71, the court sentenced the appellant to a term of one year in the Nassau County jail. The codefendant received similar sentences on counts 12 and 71. The appeal by the appellant is from so much of the judgment convicting him of count 71 as sentenced him to a term of one year in the Nassau County jail. He contends that said sentence is excessive. The appeal is based on his contentions that: (1) the sentence on the misdemeanor count was imposed on the assumption, without any warrant in the record, that he had committed other violations of law not covered by the counts to which he had pleaded guilty; (2) as a matter of discretion, the sentence was excessive. When due consideration is given to the nature of the crimes involved, the necessity for protecting society and attempting to prevent future offenses of the same kind (ef. 15 Am. Jur., Criminal Law, \u00a7 506), the legislative policy of imposing sentences in narcotic eases that are so severe that they will act as deterrents (cf. Annual Message of the Governor, Public Papers of Thomas E. Dewey, 1952, pp. 12-13; Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, Fallon Publications, 1947, Address before the New York Academy of Medicine, November 1, 1928, p. 379; cf. People v. Corapi, 42 Misc 2d 247, 250), and the contents of the probation report (cf. Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241; People v. Leipzig, 23 A D 2d 854; People v. Dusablon, 16 N Y 2d 9, 17), it may not be held that the sentence was excessive. People v. Ayiotis (23 A D 2d 760) is readily distinguishable. Insofar as it may be read as prohibiting a sentencing Judge from taking into consideration facts directly related to the crimes with which the defendant was charged and to the crimes of which he was convicted, as revealed in the probation report, merely because the defendant, in pleading guilty to some counts of the indictment did not plead guilty to other counts, it is overruled (cf. Williams v. New York, supra; People v. Leipzig, supra; People v. Dusablon, supra). Beldoek, P. J., Ughetta, Brennan, Hill and Hopkins, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed his one-year jail sentence for a misdemeanor conviction under section 1751-a of the Penal Law, arguing that the sentence was excessive and based on unproven assumptions of additional violations.

Following jury selection for defendant\u2019s trial on these charges, defendant withdrew his previously entered plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. At the time of the plea, County Court made it clear that although a sentence of 2 to 6 years was discussed, the plea was unconditional and there was no commitment as to the sentence that would ultimately be imposed. Thereafter, defense counsel requested two adjournments and ultimately a bench warrant was issued for defendant\u2019s arrest. Ultimately, after defendant could not be located, County Court made a finding that defendant\u2019s absence was deliberate and proceeded to sentence defendant in absentia to the harshest allowable sentence of SUs to 25 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Although defendant maintains that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion. County Court specifically warned defendant at his plea allocution that if he failed to appear for the scheduled sentencing date and his failure was unexcused, the court would definitely impose the harshest sentence and would do so in defendant\u2019s absence. Thus, defendant\u2019s failure to appear despite this specific warning justified the imposition of the more severe sentence (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718).\nTurning to the issues raised by defendant in his pro se brief, we are similarly unpersuaded that grounds for reversal have been presented. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the Grand Jury evidence was forfeited by his guilty plea (see, People v Freeman, 198 AD2d 725, lv denied 83 NY2d 804) and, in any event, the claim lacks merit. Finally, it was not improper for County Court to sentence defendant in absentia given the warnings administered and the circumstances presented (see, People v Santiago, 190 AD2d 700, lv denied 81 NY2d 976).\nCardona, P.

Defendant\u2019s sole contentions on this appeal are that his sentence is unduly harsh and excessive and that the laws under which it was pronounced are unconstitutional. The record reveals that defendant was advised at the time he entered his plea of guilty that the District Attorney would recommend that a minimum three-year term of imprisonment be imposed upon him at the time of sentence. A minimum sentence of eight years and four months of imprisonment for the crime of which he was convicted was authorized (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.39; 70.00 subd 3, par [a], cl [iii]). When that recommendation was in fact made, defense counsel asked that it be followed. Furthermore, it appears that the instant guilty plea was accepted in satisfaction of other unspecified charges. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the minimum term of imprisonment selected by the sentencing court constituted an abuse of discretion. The maximum term of life imprisonment imposed herein was mandated by statute (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00 subd 2, par [a]), and has previously withstood the same type of constitutional attack as defendant now urges upon us (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100).

County Court sentenced him on the criminal possession convictions to concurrent prison terms of eight years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and imposed a 1V.3 to 4-year prison term for the tampering with physical evidence conviction, to run consecutively to the other sentences. Defendant appeals.\nBy pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his claims of ineffec tive assistance of counsel, as none of his allegations of ineffectiveness directly affected the plea bargaining process (see People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Straight, 106 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2013]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]). Although defendant contends that counsel failed to review the presentence investigation report with him, counsel stated that he had reviewed it and he addressed that report at sentencing. Defendant spoke at sentencing and did not complain that he had been prevented from reviewing that report, rendering this claim unpreserved (see People v Stacchini, 108 AD3d 866, 867 [2013]).\nThe sentence imposed by County Court was lawful. Given defendant\u2019s criminal record, the court\u2019s disbelief regarding his contention that he was merely a user and not a seller of drugs, and his actions in trying to eat cocaine and dump it on the floor of the police station to destroy evidence, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction of his sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Souffrant, 104 AD3d 992, 993 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1010 [2013]).\nLahtinen, J.P., Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which had convicted the defendant of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance and tampering with physical evidence following his guilty plea.

Following negotiations between the District Attorney, defendant and his counsel, the former moved to reduce the second count of the indictment to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class D felony, and urged that a plea thereto be accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. Prior to granting the motion and accepting the plea, County Court thoroughly instructed defendant as to his rights and options and advised defendant that if he pleaded to the reduced charge, he would receive a prison sentence no greater than one having as its minimum 2 Vs years and as its maximum 7 years. County Court further advised that the precise sentence would have to await its examination of the presentence report and consideration of counsel\u2019s remarks at sentencing. After consultation with his attorney, defendant expressed his desire to plead guilty. The motion of the District Attorney was granted and defendant\u2019s plea to the reduced charge was accepted. Later, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 2 t\u00e9 to 7 years.\nDefendant now appeals upon the sole ground that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. We first observe that CPL 450.10, to the extent that it impaired an appeal as of right, has been found to be violative of the NY Constitution (People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264) and, accordingly, we turn to the merits.\nPrefatorily, the sentence imposed was within permissible limits (Penal Law \u00a7 220.09 [1]; \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 70.00 [2] [d]). That leniency was extended is clearly demonstrated by the grant of the motion to reduce the charge and by acceptance of the plea to the reduced charge in full satisfaction of the indictment (see, People v Bass, 92 AD2d 1062). Any and all commitments to defendant were fully complied with. Given these circumstances, defendant\u2019s unenviable record and the quantity of heroin involved, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion, and no extraordinary circumstances warranting our interference with the sentence have been demonstrated (see, People v Whiting, 89 AD2d 694; People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663).\nJudgment affirmed.

He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 years, 5x/2 years and 5x/2 years to life, respectively, all sentences accompanied by applicable periods of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, claiming that his pleas of guilty were involuntary, he received the ineffective assistance of counsel and the sentences were harsh and excessive.\nWe disagree and affirm. Defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; People v Vanguilder, 32 AD3d 1110, 1110 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 904 [2006]). In any event, this claim is without merit. His claim that he was confused and under duress at the time he entered his guilty pleas finds no record support as his rights and the consequences of his pleas were repeatedly and thoroughly explained to him. Although some degree of tension between defendant and his attorney is evident, there is no indication that the pleas were in any way coerced. Notably, defendant made neither a protestation of innocence nor any claim of ignorance with respect to his constitutional rights.\nNext, defendant\u2019s present claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Wise, 29 AD3d 1216, 1216 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 852 [2006]). In any event, again the record reveals no merit to this claim. Counsel made an omnibus motion, sought suppression of all identification evidence at a hearing and, in view of defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, successfully negotiated an extremely advantageous plea bargain agreement (see People v Anderson, 38 AD3d 1061, 1063 [2007]; People v Downs, 38 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2007]). Accordingly, were we to reach this issue, we would conclude that defendant was afforded the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).\nFinally, any challenge to the sentence imposed is precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]). Moreover, as the record fails to reveal any extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction, defendant\u2019s sentences were neither harsh nor excessive (see People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 917 [2000]).\nCrew III, J.P., Spain, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant was subsequently sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of eight years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nContrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find his appeal waiver to be valid. County Court did not lump the right to appeal with the panoply of rights usually forfeited by a guilty plea, and defendant agreed that he understood the \u201cseparate and distinct nature\u201d of the right to appeal. Moreover, defendant confirmed on the record that he understood the written appeal waiver that he had executed in open court, which explained that \u201cthe waiver of [defendant\u2019s] appellate rights is separate and distinct from those rights . . . automatically forfeited upon [his] plea of guilty.\u201d The written waiver adequately detailed the scope of the appellate rights that defendant was waiving and recited that defendant had discussed the waiver of those rights with counsel. Accordingly, we find defendant\u2019s combined oral and written waiver to be knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Belile, 137 AD3d 1460, 1461 [2016]; People v McKenzie, 136 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]; People v Devault, 124 AD3d 1140, 1140 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 989 [2015]). Defendant\u2019s contention that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive is barred by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1333 [2016], lv denied 29 NY3d 1001 [2017]).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender survives his valid appeal waiver (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]). However, defendant failed to object to being sentenced as a second felony offender despite having the opportunity to do so, and the issue is therefore unpreserved (see People v Caldwell, 80 AD3d 998, 999 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 857 [2011]; People v Glynn, 72 AD3d at 1352). In any event, were this issue properly before us, we would find, upon reviewing the record, that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Hummel, 127 AD3d 1506, 1507 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1202 [2015]; compare People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]).\nLynch, Clark, Aarons and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea. The court found the defendant's waiver of his right to appeal to be valid, as it was made knowingly and voluntarily, and ruled that his claim regarding the harshness of his sentence was barred by this waiver. Additionally, the court noted that while the defendant's challenge to his status as a second felony offender was preserved, he did not object at sentencing, rendering the issue unpreserved; the court also found substantial compliance with sentencing procedures.<|eot_id|>"}

On the original date of sentencing, County Court granted defendant\u2019s request for a one-week furlough in order to allow him to spend time with his family, including his newborn child. In so doing, the court admonished defendant that his failure to appear for the newly-scheduled sentencing hearing could result in the imposition of the maximum sentence allowable by law. Despite that warning, defendant failed to appear for sentencing as directed and was eventually brought into court via a bench warrant. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to 6V2 years in prison (less than the maximum allowed) and three years of postrelease supervision for the attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction and 2 to 4 years in prison for the tampering with physical evidence conviction, with those sentences ordered to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant concedes that County Court was authorized to impose an enhanced sentence, yet asserts that the GVs-year sentence in connection with the attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Our review of the record reveals neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of any extraordinary circumstances justifying a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Favor, 49 AD3d 915, 916 [2008]).

In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was thereafter sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appealed and his assigned counsel filed an Anders brief and moved to be relieved as counsel. This Court rejected the Anders brief, withheld decision and assigned new counsel to address certain issues raised by defendant in his pro se brief and any other issues disclosed in the record (123 AD3d 1157 [2014]).\nWe now affirm. Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his waiver of appeal, as we are satisfied upon our review of the plea colloquy and the written waivers of appeal that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Ramos, 135 AD3d 1234, 1235 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 935 [2016]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1349-1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]; People v Viele, 130 AD3d 1097, 1097 [2015]). The valid waiver of appeal precludes defendant\u2019s challenge to County Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the crack cocaine found on his person (see People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1230 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015]; People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]; People v Colon, 101 AD3d 1161, 1161 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]).\nDefendant further argues that count 2 of the indictment charging him with conspiracy in the fourth degree was jurisdictionally defective because it failed to allege all material elements of the crime, particularly the object crime that he and another person allegedly conspired to commit. While this argument survives both defendant\u2019s guilty plea and his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-233 [2000]; People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Martinez, 79 AD3d 1378, 1379 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 798 [2011]), we find no merit to it. \u201cAn indictment is jurisdictionally defective only if it does not effectively charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime\u2014for instance, if it fails to allege that the defendant committed acts constituting every material element of the crime charged\u201d (People v D\u2019Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 734-735 [2002]; see People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]). As relevant here, \u201c[a] person is guilty of conspiracy in the fourth degree when, with intent that conduct constituting ... a class B or class C felony be performed, he or she agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 105.10 [1]).\nHere, count 2 of the indictment charging conspiracy in the fourth degree incorporated by reference the applicable statutory provision, which reference \u201coperates without more to constitute allegations of all the elements of the crime\u201d (People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586 [1981]; see People v D'Angelo, 98 NY2d at 735; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d 979, 980 [2015]). Moreover, with respect to the object crime, count 2 of the indictment specifically set forth the same conduct alleged in count 1 of the indictment charging bribery in the second degree, a class C felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 200.03). Accordingly, as count 2 of the challenged indictment charged defendant with the commission of a particular crime and sufficiently apprised him of that crime (see People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850 [1988]; People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1115 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d at 980), it was not jurisdiction-ally defective.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Garry, Devine and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court upheld the guilty plea of the defendant, who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree, as he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. The court found no merit in the defendant's argument that the conspiracy charge was jurisdictionally defective, determining that the indictment sufficiently included all necessary elements of the crime. Consequently, the judgment of the County Court was affirmed.<|eot_id|>"}

These charges arose out of his sale of cocaine to a confidential police informant on two occasions in June 2000 and the discovery of cocaine during the execution of a valid search warrant. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 6V2 to 13 years. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we note that defendant signed a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal which forecloses his challenges to the denial of his suppression motion and the severity of his sentence (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Wilkins, 294 AD2d 707). Nevertheless, were we to reach these issues we would find them to be without merit. Testimony at the Wade hearing established that the photo array was conducted according to proper police procedure and was not unduly suggestive (see, People v Parker, 257 AD2d 693, 694, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024). In light of defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, our review of the record discloses no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed, nor any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant a modification (see, People v Vazquez, 284 AD2d 730, 730).\nFurthermore, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea and the competency of counsel, while not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, are not preserved for our review because he failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617; People v Millis, 266 AD2d 581, 581, lv denied 94 NY2d 826). In any event, the record establishes that County Court engaged in a thorough plea colloquy with defendant, during which he acknowledged that he understood the rights he was giving up, that he had not been coerced, that he was not under the influence of medication or alcohol and that he did, in fact, sell cocaine as charged. Accordingly, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Tinkham, 273 AD2d 619, 620, lv denied 95 NY2d 872; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769, lv denied 89 NY2d 919).\nFinally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Before removing himself from the case because of a conflict, defendant\u2019s original counsel filed an extensive pretrial omnibus motion, challenging the validity of the search warrant, as well as the credibility of the confidential informant, and requesting various pretrial hearings (see, People v Mateo, 252 AD2d 821, 821-822, lv denied 92 NY2d 927). After unsuccessfully attempting to suppress the photo identification through a Wade hearing, defendant\u2019s new counsel secured a very favorable plea agreement, especially considering defendant\u2019s potential exposure to substantial prison time. We, therefore, conclude that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance was affirmed by the court, as the defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal. The court found no merit in challenges to the suppression motion or sentence severity, and determined that the plea was knowing and voluntary following a thorough colloquy. Additionally, the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were rejected, as previous counsel had adequately represented him before a conflict arose, and the plea agreement was favorable given the circumstances.<|eot_id|>"}

In connection with the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant of the rights that he was relinquishing as a part of this particular plea bargain, then delegated responsibility for conducting the plea allocution to defense counsel, informing defendant, without obtaining a waiver of the right to counsel, that counsel was \u201cno longer representing you in the sense of protecting you.\u201d Defense counsel then conducted the factual portion of the plea allocution. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant to eight years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea was not voluntary and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.\nDefendant\u2019s allegations regarding the right to counsel at the plea proceeding implicate the voluntariness of his plea and, thus, they are not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Wright, 21 AD3d 583, 583-584 [2005], lvs denied 5 NY3d 857 [2005], 6 NY3d 820 [2006]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]). Moreover, while defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Grant, 294 AD2d 671, 672 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 730 [2002]; People v Goodings, 277 AD2d 725, 725 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 735 [2001]), \u201ca violation of the right to counsel may be reviewed in the absence of an objection\u201d (People v Dean, 47 NY2d 967, 968 [1979]; cf. People v Montanez, 287 AD2d 407, 408 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 685 [2001]).\nAlthough \u201c[t]he fact that [an] attorney participates in the plea allocution does not. . . necessarily constitute reversible er ror\u201d when the allocution is performed under the court\u2019s supervision and the right to counsel is adequately safeguarded (People v Empey, 141 AD2d 987, 988 [1988]; see People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 350 [1967], cert denied 393 US 1067 [1969]; People v Skinner, 284 AD2d 906, 907 [2001]; People v Sanchez, 284 AD2d 137, 137 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 942 [2001]), we have long criticized the practice of courts delegating the duty to conduct the plea allocution (see People v Bonneau, 142 AD2d 890, 890-891 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 889 [1989]; People v Maye, 129 AD2d 204, 205-206 [1987]). Moreover, here, County Court announced that not only did it intend to delegate the allocution in its entirety with respect to the factual basis of the plea but also that, at its urging, counsel would take a position adverse to defendant during a critical stage of the proceedings (see generally People v Settles, 46 NY2d 154, 165-166 [1978]; People v Lewis, 286 AD2d 934, 935 [2001]; People v Santana, 156 AD2d 736, 737 [1989], lv denied 79 NY2d 863 [1992]). Under these circumstances, we agree with defendant that his plea was rendered involuntary and, thus, reversal is required.\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, guilty plea vacated and matter remitted to the County Court of Tioga County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court reversed the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, ruling that his guilty plea was involuntary due to the County Court's improper delegation of the plea allocution to defense counsel, who was instructed to take an adverse position against the defendant. The court noted that this practice undermined the defendant's right to effective legal representation and warranted a vacating of the plea and remittance for further proceedings.<|eot_id|>"}

Before County Court accepted the plea, however, it warned defendant that, in the event that he violated the conditions of the plea agreement, including the obligation to return to court on the sentencing date, it would not be bound by the agreed-upon prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. Defendant acknowledged that he understood the warning as explained to him. He nevertheless failed to appear for the scheduled sentencing hearing and was brought before the court in October 2003. County Court, finding that defendant had breached the terms of the plea agreement, sentenced him to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s argument that County Court erred in imposing a sentence greater than that which was contemplated by the plea agreement without allowing him the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea \u201cfalls squarely within the scope of his waiver of the right to appeal, which he failed to challenge by moving to vacate the plea or judgment\u201d (People v Perham, 263 AD2d 766, 766 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1045 [1999] [citation omitted]; see People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 791 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 833 [2000]). In any event, defendant\u2019s contention is unpersuasive inasmuch as he, without any valid excuse, breached the unequivocal requirement that he be present for sentencing, thereby justifying County Court\u2019s determination to impose an enhanced sentence (see People v Perham, supra at 767).\nWe similarly conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence on the ground that it is harsh and excessive is not properly before us in light of his knowing waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Schryver, 306 AD2d 626, 626-627 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 598 [2003]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800 [2001]). Nevertheless, even if we were to consider this issue, there is no record evidence demonstrating an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court or the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence here (see People v Calkins, 6 AD3d 744, 746 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 671 [2004]).\nWe have reviewed defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those contained in his pro se brief, and find each of them to be similarly encompassed by the waiver of his right to appeal.\nPeters, Carpinello, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

Following the plea, defendant was released on her own recognizance with the condition that if she failed to reappear on the sentencing date County Court was authorized to revoke its sentencing commitment and impose a sentence of 5 to 15 years in prison. Defendant failed to appear on January 9, 1998 for sentencing, was indicted on April 3, 1998 for bail jumping in the first degree, was arrested in the City of Middletown, Orange County, on or about June 10, 1998 and returned to Broome County. On August 20, 1998, County Court, denied her motion to withdraw her previous plea and imposed the enhanced sentence, whereupon the bail jumping charge was dismissed on the People\u2019s motion.

Acknowledging that defendant was only 19 years of age at the time of conviction, that he has support from his friends and family and that he has made certain improvements in his life while incarcerated, we remain unpersuaded that his sentence should be modified.\nOn November 29, 1999, defendant was convicted of misdemeanor charges involving unlawful possession of marihuana and unlawful dealing with a child. The felony convictions stem from his having made, on five separate occasions during the months of September and October 1999, sales of cocaine to an undercover State Police Investigator. His 10-count indictment included at least two A-I felonies. He was allowed to plead to two A-II felonies\u2014in full satisfaction of the indictment\u2014on condition that he receive two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of SVs years to life. The sentencing minutes reflect his full understanding of the bargain. While the sentence imposed was the maximum for an A-II felony, it is within the permissible statutory range and the record reveals no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances. Hence, we decline to disturb it (see, People v Britt, 283 AD2d 778, 781, lv denied 96 NY2d 916; People v Spencer, 272 AD2d 682, 685, lv denied 95 NY2d 858; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Despite acknowledging his young age and improvements during incarceration, the court found no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a sentence reduction. The decision was unanimous among the justices.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant\u2019s contention that ineffective assistance of counsel compelled him to plead guilty is without merit. Defense counsel\u2019s performance, when viewed in its totality, fully satisfied the criteria of effective legal representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147), defendant\u2019s current disagreement with defense counsel\u2019s professional advice and strategies notwithstanding. Our review of the record herein discloses that defendant\u2019s guilty plea represented a voluntary, knowing and intelligent choice (see, People v Legault, 180 AD2d 912, 913, lv denied 79 NY2d 1051), as evidenced by the fact that it resulted in the satisfaction of a three-count indictment and a sentence that was far less than the one to which he would have been exposed had his case gone to trial.\nMercure, J.

County Court denied this motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant to eight years to life in accordance with the plea bargain. In our view, County Court did not abuse its discretion by denying this motion.

New counsel has submitted a brief challenging the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal and the severity of the sentence.\nTurning to the appeal waiver, the record discloses that defendant executed a written waiver and related to County Court during the plea colloquy that he voluntarily signed it. County Court did not, however, explain the nature and ramifications of the waiver or ensure that defendant had read and understood it (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the waiver was invalid and does not preclude defendant from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Lemon, 137 AD3d at 1423).\nUpon his plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record and his acquiescence to the sentence as part of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Day, 133 AD3d 920, 920 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Rose and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the Schenectady County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance was reviewed, and the court found that the defendant's waiver of the right to appeal was invalid due to a lack of proper explanation and understanding.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [1]; \u00a7 220.43), with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of five years to life. However, a sentence of an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years to life constitutes an illegally low sentence for a class A-I felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). Apparently, the parties and the court were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). Under these circumstances, with the consent of the People, the conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see People v Carter, 196 AD2d 633, 634; People v Rozo, 196 AD2d 514, 515; People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; see also People v Labode, 280 AD2d 400).

Due to a misunderstanding that the crime was classified as a class A-II felony, the court, with the consent of the prosecution, agreed to reduce the conviction to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree to align with the original plea agreement. The case is sent back to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for this adjustment.<|eot_id|>"}

Thereafter, the People received information that the defendant intended to flee, and he was returned on a bench warrant and appeared for sentencing on the scheduled sentencing date. Upon finding that there was evidence that the defendant had intended to flee, the Supreme Court imposed an enhanced sentence of four and one-half to nine years imprisonment, without giving the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.\nWe reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the plea agreement was not conditiotied upon his returning for sentencing. The condition to return for sentencing can be fairly implied from the court\u2019s promise (cf., People v Moreno, 196 AD2d 850; People v White, 144 AD2d 711). However, without deciding the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s mere intent to breach a plea agreement is a sufficient reason for the court to impose an enhanced sentence, we find that the evidence that the defendant intended to flee was inadequate. Thus, the defendant is entitled to his original bargain (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122; People v McKinney, 215 AD2d 407; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709). Ritter, J.

Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive. However, because defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, he has failed to preserve this issue for our review (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Nevertheless, were we to reach this issue, we would find that defendant has presented insufficient evidence of extraordinary circumstances so as to warrant a modification of his sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Brown, 251 AD2d 694, lv denied 92 NY2d 1029; People v Motter, 235 AD2d 582, 589, lv denied 89 NY2d 1038).\nMikoll, J.

After denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of two years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant did not effectively waive his right to appeal because neither the oral colloquy nor the written appeal waiver advised defendant that the appeal waiver \u201cis separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1265 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]). While defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent was preserved for appellate review by his motion to vacate the plea, this claim lacks merit (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]). County Court advised him of the terms of the plea agreement, the trial-related rights that he was forgoing and the consequences of his plea, and he was afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel and indicated that he understood the plea terms and agreed to them. Defendant then admitted to each of the allegations in count 1 of the indictment. He was not required to recite the elements of the crime or the underlying facts, as his unequivocal affirmative responses to the court\u2019s questions were adequate to establish his guilt (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because counsel \u201callowed\u201d him to plead guilty while his statutory speedy trial motion was pending (see People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]). Counsel made and pursued a motion to dismiss on statutory speedy trial grounds (compare People v Garcia, 33 AD3d 1050, 1051-1052 [2006], lv denied 9 NY3d 844 [2007]), and presumably weighed the likelihood of success on that motion when advising defendant to accept a plea to only one of five counts, with a promise of the minimum sentence on that count. It was ultimately defendant\u2019s decision whether to accept the- plea agreement while that motion remained undecided. To the extent that defendant raises arguments concerning what counsel advised him with regard to whether to enter a guilty plea and what documents defendant may or may not have had when he entered his plea, those arguments address matters outside the record on appeal, which are more properly raised in a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Haffiz, 19 NY3d 883, 885 [2012]; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1379-1380 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 965 [2014]). By pleading guilty, aware of the fact that his CPL 30.30 motion was pending, defendant forfeited that defense (see People v O\u2019Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]; People v Friscia, 51 NY2d 845, 847 [1980]; People v Irvis, 90 AD3d 1302, 1303 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 962 [2012]; People v Burke, 90 AD3d 1246, 1247 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 956 [2012]).

At the time of the plea, defendant was incarcerated. Although County Court did not advise defendant at the time of the plea that an enhanced sentence would be imposed if defendant failed to appear for sentencing, when defendant thereafter was released on .a bond prior to sentencing, the court advised him that he would be sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment if he failed to appear for sentencing. When defendant failed to appear for sentencing, the court issued a bench warrant and defendant was picked up on the warrant approximately one week after the sentencing date. The court imposed an enhanced sentence of 6 to 12 years. Although defendant waived his right to appeal, we conclude that defendant did not knowingly waive his right to appeal with respect to the enhanced sentence because there was no discussion of that issue at the time of the plea (see, People v Gilchrist, 251 AD2d 1030, 1031, Iv denied 92 NY2d 925). The condition that defendant return for sentencing was not imposed as a condition of the plea, and thus the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to Oneida County Court for resentencing (see, People v Spina, 186 AD2d 9, 9-10; see also, People v Nunez, 248 AD2d 561; cf., People v Radek, 202 AD2d 847, 848, Iv denied 83 NY2d 914, 84 NY2d 939). \u201c[I]f the court finds that it is unable to impose the sentence which was agreed upon when the defendant pleaded guilty, the defendant should be permitted to withdraw the plea\u201d (People v Rodney E., 77 NY2d 672, 676; see, People v Spina, supra at 10). In light of our determination, we decline to consider the remaining contentions.

The defendant had pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and was not properly informed that failing to appear at sentencing would result in an enhanced sentence.

Despite defendant\u2019s lack of a prior criminal record, we find no reason to disturb County Court\u2019s refusal to grant defendant youthful offender status in light of the seriousness of the offense and evidence of other violent conduct by defendant (see, People v Barriera, 172 AD2d 319, lv denied 78 NY2d 961; People v Carter, 143 AD2d 925, lv denied 73 NY2d 853). As to the sentence imposed, although it is the harshest allowed for the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty, defendant\u2019s plea was in satisfaction of a four-count indictment against him. In addition, the People agreed as part of the plea arrangement not to pursue other charges then pending against defendant. Finally, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he could receive the sentence ultimately imposed. Under these circumstances, we find no basis for disturbing the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Rodriguez, 187 AD2d 752, lv denied 81 NY2d 793; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nMikoll, J.

However, the defendant\u2019s contention is unpreserved for appellate review because the defendant did not move to vacate his pleas or otherwise raise the issue in the County Court (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182 [2013]; People v Clarke, 93 NY2d 904, 906 [1999]; People v Morris, 147 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2017]; People v Jackson, 114 AD3d 807 [2014]). In any event, the pleas were knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17 [1983]). The court adequately advised the defendant of the constitutional rights he was surrendering by pleading guilty (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; cf. People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359 [2013]), and the record affirmatively demonstrates the defendant\u2019s understanding and waiver of those constitutional rights (see People v Sirico, 135 AD3d 19, 22 [2015]; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d 1081, 1082 [2015]; People v Bennett, 122 AD3d 871, 872 [2014]).\nFurthermore, the defendant\u2019s assertion that he did not understand the plea proceedings because he was taking medication for a psychological condition is belied by the transcript of the plea proceedings, which demonstrates that the defendant expressly denied taking any drugs at that time and confirmed that he understood what was happening (see People v Quinones, 63 AD3d 759, 760 [2009]; People v Brooks, 36 AD3d 929, 930 [2007]; People v Bangert, 107 AD2d 752, 753 [1985]). While the presentence report contains the defendant\u2019s postplea statement that he was prescribed medication for depression while incarcerated, there is no basis in the record to support his contention that he lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings against him (see People v Morris, 147 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2017]; People v Thomas, 139 AD3d 986, 987 [2016]; People v Narbonne, 131 AD3d 626, 627 [2015]).\nThe defendant\u2019s valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]) precludes appellate review of his contention that the sentences imposed were excessive (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9 [1989]).\nMastro, J.P., Hall, Cohen and Iannacci, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant's appeals from three judgments convicting him of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance were affirmed by the County Court. The defendant argued that his guilty pleas were not made knowingly and voluntarily due to a lack of understanding of his rights and the effects of medication; however, these claims were deemed unpreserved for appellate review, and the court found that the pleas were entered with a clear understanding of the proceedings. Additionally, the defendant's waiver of the right to appeal barred any claims regarding the excessiveness of his sentences.<|eot_id|>"}

After defendant failed to appear at the arraignment, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. More than two years later, after defendant was located in Florida and brought to New York, he pleaded guilty to the first count of the indictment, which was reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, in full satisfaction of all charges. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal and was to be sentenced to four years to life in prison. Defendant was sentenced as agreed and appealed. This Court rejected a previous Anders brief and assigned new counsel (12 AD3d 723 [2004]).\nInitially, inasmuch as defendant neither moved to withdraw the plea nor vacate the judgment of conviction, he is precluded from challenging the voluntariness of his plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Daniels, 16 AD3d 780, 780 [2005]; People v Brown, 309 AD2d 1084, 1084 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 595 [2004]). In any event, our review of the record discloses that defendant was fully advised of the ramifications of pleading guilty and indicated that he understood. Accordingly, we find that both the plea and waiver were knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered. Defendant\u2019s voluntary waiver of appeal encompasses his claims that the search and seizure was illegal and that his statutory speedy trial right was violated (see People v Newsome, 17 AD3d 785 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d 819, 820 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]). Although the waiver does not extend to his constitutional right to a speedy trial, this claim has not been preserved inasmuch as it is raised for the first time on this appeal (see People v Robinson, 1 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 745 [2004]; People v Haas, 229 AD2d 733, 734 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 1021 [1996]).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur.

The defendant's plea was deemed to have been entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, precluding him from challenging its voluntariness or the waiver of his right to appeal. Additionally, his claims regarding illegal search and seizure and violation of speedy trial rights were found to be encompassed by the waiver and unpreserved, respectively.<|eot_id|>"}

Upon remittal, the court held a hearing, after which it concluded that there was, indeed, a legitimate basis for two of defendant\u2019s arrests. As such, the court imposed an enhanced sentence of 472 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we now affirm.\nCounty Court conducted a hearing relative to defendant\u2019s postplea arrests wherein testimony was given by an alleged victim in one of the matters and an eyewitness in the other matter regarding circumstances underlying the arrests. Defendant was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and make any statements that he deemed pertinent. Having reviewed the hearing transcript, we are satisfied that County Court complied with the mandates set forth in both People v Outley (80 NY2d 702 [1993]) and our prior decision (29 AD3d 1177 [2006], supra), and properly determined that there was a legitimate basis for the arrests.

At sentencing the court erroneously directed that the sentence run consecutively, rather than concurrently, to a sentence of 3 to 6 years already being served by the defendant for another crime (Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2-a]). At the proceeding to amend the sentence, while the defendant was given the opportunity to speak, he neither requested to withdraw his plea nor protested that the new lesser, consecutive sentence imposed for the present offenses of 3 to 6 years imprisonment, was excessive.\nAs a general rule, \"a guilty plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored\u201d (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert denied 419 US 1122; see also, People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751, 753). However, this principle is not applicable where, as here, the defendant\u2019s claim has not been preserved for appellate review and where the sentence actually imposed was not abusive or illegal (see, People v Ifill, 108 AD2d 202, 203; see also, People v Aitken, 148 AD2d 459, 459-460; People v Jones, 140 AD2d 372; People v Burton, 133 AD2d 276).

He was thereafter sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 20 to 60 years. On appeal, this Court modified the sentence, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 6 to 21 years in prison (People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888 [2005]).

Thus, he may not raise on appeal the issues proffered in those motions (see, People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, cert denied 423 US 873; People v Colarusso, 103 AD2d 848).\nAs part of the negotiated plea bargain, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive a sentence of an indeterminate term of eight years to life imprisonment. The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of eight years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally low term of imprisonment for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that his conviction should be reduced to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which is a class AII felony, and the People contend that his conviction should be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which is also a class A-II felony.\nUnder these circumstances, the conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced, in the interest of justice, to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.18), in order to better effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489). Moreover, since the sentence imposed upon the defendant\u2019s plea was the sentence promised, no purpose would be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we leave the sentence undisturbed (see, People v Laino, supra, at 226-227; People v Brown, supra, at 490; People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743). Bracken, J.

The court modified the conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, recognizing that both the defendant and the prosecution were under the mistaken belief regarding the felony classification, which allowed the existing sentence to remain undisturbed as it aligned with the plea agreement. The defendant could not raise pretrial motion issues on appeal due to their withdrawal prior to the plea.<|eot_id|>"}

She pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the second indictment. Her subsequent motion to withdraw her pleas was denied and she was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 3 to 6 years for the criminal sede conviction and 2 to 4 years for the criminal possession conviction. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant maintains that, because of her history of mental health problems, County Court erred, first, in accepting her guilty pleas and, second, in denying her motion to withdraw the pleas. A review of the record confirms that County Court was aware of defendant\u2019s mental health condition and, as a result, engaged in a thorough colloquy during each allocution, ensuring that defendant understood the nature of the charges, her rights and the consequences of pleading guilty. Defendant, in turn, expressed her full comprehension, freely admitted the facts underlying the respective crimes and pleaded guilty thereto. Under these circumstances, we find that defendant\u2019s guilty pleas were knowing, intelligent and voluntary and, as such, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to withdraw the pleas (see People v Lawrence, 34 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]).\nDefendant also contends that her sentences are harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s appeal waivers were invalid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]), her contention is properly before us. However, nothing in the record demonstrates an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court or the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences (see People v Lowe, 34 AD3d 979, 980-981 [2006]; People v Thompson, 33 AD3d 1131,1131 [2006]).\nCrew III, J.P., Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

In addition, defendant agreed to pay restitution and executed a waiver of his right to appeal in open court. Although the People agreed to recommend a sentence of two years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision, County Court informed defendant that it was making no commitment as to sentencing. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision and ordered him to pay restitution, including various surcharges. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid. Although \u201ca trial court need not engage in any particular litany or catechism in satisfying itself that a defendant has entered a knowing, intelligent and voluntary appeal waiver, a trial court must make certain that a defendant\u2019s understanding of the waiver ... is evident on the face of the record\u201d (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Here, in view of the fleeting reference to defendant\u2019s appeal waiver and absence of any acknowledgment by defendant that he understood the ramifications of the waiver, we cannot conclude that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Burton, 93 AD3d 949, 949 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 958 [2012]).\nTurning to the merits, given that the amount of restitution was explicitly included in the plea agreement and defendant did not object to that amount or request a hearing, his challenge to the restitution order is not preserved for our review (see People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d 1035, 1037 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]; People v Giovanni, 53 AD3d 778, 778-779 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 832 [2008]). Similarly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the 10% restitution surcharge is not preserved absent an objection at sentencing (see People v Snyder, 38 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2007]). Finally, given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history and the fact that County Court informed defendant during the plea colloquy of the maximum potential sentence, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mosley, 87 AD3d 1179, 1179 [2011]; People v Qasem, 39 AD3d 960, 961 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]).\nMercure, J.P., Lahtinen, Stein and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Defendant now appeals from County Court\u2019s denial, in a written decision, of his CPL 440.20 motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that New York\u2019s persistent felony sentencing scheme violates his rights under the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution, relying on Apprendi v New Jersey (530 US 466 [2000]). We disagree and affirm.\nDefendant argued in his pro se motion to set aside his sentence that his constitutional rights were infringed upon because a judge, rather than a jury, determined whether he would receive an enhanced sentence under the persistent felony offender statutes (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.10; see also CPL 400.20). County Court properly rejected that contention (see People v Rivera, 5 NY3d 61, 66 [2005], cert denied \u2014 US \u2014, 126 S Ct 564 [2005]; People v Rosen, 96 NY2d 329, 334-335 [2001], cert denied 534 US 899 [2001]; People v Pelkey, 27 AD3d 785, 785 [2006]; People v Bingham, 24 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 831 [2006]; People v Conger, 19 AD3d 938, 939 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 827 [2005]).\nDefendant now also argues, for the first time on this appeal, that CPL 400.20 was unconstitutional and unconstitutionally applied at the time of his 1993 sentencing and remained so until it was clarified or \u201ccured\u201d in 2001 by the Court of Appeals in People v Rosen (supra at 334-335), and later in People v Rivera (supra at 66). From that premise, defendant argues that he was sentenced in accordance with a then-constitutionally deficient statute, requiring that his sentence be vacated. Inasmuch as this issue was never raised in his CPL 440.20 motion or otherwise argued in County Court, it has not been preserved for our review (see People v Pelkey, supra; CPL 470.05 [2]) and we decline to address it in the interest of justice.\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

He thereaf ter executed a written waiver of indictment in open court, consenting to be prosecuted by a superior court information, and County Court approved the waiver. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends that County Court never acquired jurisdiction over this matter, with the issue specifically distilling to whether defendant was appropriately held for action of the grand jury prior to his waiver of indictment. \u201c[A] defendant may waive indictment and consent to be prosecuted by a [superior court information] when, among other conditions not in issue here, a local criminal court has held the defendant for [g]rand [j]ury action\u201d (People v Barber, 280 AD2d 691, 692 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 825 [2001]; see CPL 195.10 [1]; People v D'Amico, 76 NY2d 877, 879 [1990]). \u201cBeing so \u2018held\u2019 for the action of a [g]rand [j]ury involves the filing of a felony complaint on which defendant has been arraigned and a finding after a preliminary hearing (unless waived by defendant) that reasonable cause exists to believe that defendant committed a felony\u201d (People v Barber, supra at 692 [emphasis added]; see People v D'Amico, supra at 879).\nHere, defendant was arraigned upon the felony complaint and, although he initially requested that a preliminary hearing be conducted on a specific date in the future, he nevertheless voluntarily entered his plea of guilty before that date, thereby effectively waiving his right to the hearing. Because defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing and \u201cthe record of the plea proceeding establishes that the Superior Court was satisfied with the waiver [of indictment] and executed an order to that effect (see, CPL 195.30), we may presume that the matter was properly before that court\u201d (People v Chad S., 237 AD2d 986, 986 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 856 [1997]). Defendant\u2019s remaining assertions concerning the validity of County Court\u2019s jurisdiction, to the extent not specifically addressed herein, have been examined and found to be unavailing.\nAs for defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we decline to review this issue given his knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; People v Tate, 28 AD3d 801 [2006]).\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

The defendant argued that the County Court lacked jurisdiction due to not being properly held for grand jury action before waiving indictment; however, the court found that he voluntarily waived his right to a preliminary hearing and thus the matter was properly before the court.

Pursuant to this plea agreement, defendant agreed to cooperate with the District Attorney\u2019s office and law enforcement officials investigating other individuals suspected of drug-related activities. In exchange for his release from jail and his satisfactory cooperation, defendant\u2019s conviction would be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree for which he would be sentenced to a minimum prison term of 2 to 4 years and a maximum term of SVa to 7 years. Defendant entered into this cooperation agreement with the knowledge that if he failed to comply with its terms, his conviction would not be reduced and he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a minimum prison term of 4V2 to 9 years and a maximum term of 12V2 to 25 years.\nFollowing defendant\u2019s release from jail, he fled the jurisdiction prior to providing any of the agreed-upon assistance. Approximately eight months later, he turned himself over to authorities and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of I2V2 to 25 years. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded from review by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 702 [2002]). Even if we were to reach the merits, considering defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction in the interest of justice (see People v Jones, 289 AD2d 871 [2001]).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Spain, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur.

A written cooperation agreement between the District Attorney and the defendant, which was incorporated into the plea agreement, gave the District Attorney sole discretion to determine whether the defendant\u2019s cooperation was \"meaningful and substantial\u201d. The plea agreement further provided that if the defendant cooperated, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and plead to a lesser charge. If he absconded, the District Attorney would recommend imposition of the maximum sentence for the B felony. Sentencing was adjourned for 60 days, and, when the defendant failed to appear on that date, a bench warrant was issued. He was arrested several months later in Connecticut. At his sentencing in December 1989 the defendant moved to withdraw his plea based on allegations that he was innocent and that the People failed to fulfill certain promises which had induced him to plead guilty.\nWe find that the court properly declined to vacate the defendant\u2019s plea based on his unsubstantiated claim of innocence (see, People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55; People v Ochoa, 179 AD2d 689). The record of the plea allocution establishes that the defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty with the advice of counsel and without any protestations of innocence. His belated claim of innocence was supported solely by the affirmation of his attorney and was contradicted by the affirmation of the Assistant District Attorney who signed the cooperation agreement. The court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion as he was afforded a reasonable opportunity to advance his contentions (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520; People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926).\nMoreover, the court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the plea should be vacated because he was induced to plead guilty by certain off-the-record promises (see, Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116; People v Frederick, supra; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). During the plea allocution, the prosecutor placed the terms of the plea agreement on the record. Thereafter, the defendant, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel responded negatively when the court asked if any other promises had been made. Since the alleged promises did not appear on the record, the court was not required to hold a hearing to determine if such promises did exist (see, Matter of Benjamin S., supra).\nUnder the circumstances, we find that the sentence imposed was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Lawrence, J. P., Eiber, O\u2019Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant's appeal from a guilty plea for criminal sale of a controlled substance was affirmed by the Supreme Court, Kings County. The court ruled that the defendant's claims of innocence and allegations of unfulfilled promises were unsubstantiated and contradicted by the record. Additionally, since the plea agreement terms were clearly stated on the record and no off-the-record promises were established, the court did not need to hold a hearing, and the sentence was deemed appropriate.<|eot_id|>"}

He waived his right to appeal during the plea colloquy and was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, as a second felony offender, to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant argues that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. However, after County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from those rights being forfeited as a result of his guilty plea, defendant executed a written appeal waiver in open court that indicated that he had discussed the matter with his attorney, fully understood the rights he was relinquishing and that he was \u201cwaiving [his] right to appeal voluntarily, knowingly, intelligently, and without coercion by anyone.\u201d Defendant also affirmed that he was willingly waiving his right to appeal on the record and, in response to multiple inquiries from County Court, stated that he had no questions regarding the issue. Under such circumstances, we find that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Dennis, 66 AD3d 1058, 1058 [2009]; People v Tabbott, 61 AD3d 1183, 1184 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 750 [2009]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967-968 [2008]).\nFinally, given his valid appeal waiver, defendant has forfeited his right to challenge the sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Seitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1252 [2009]).\nSpain, J.P., Lahtinen, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur.

County Court sentenced defendant to two consecutive prison terms of six years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, the People established a proper foundation for the admission of tape-recorded conversations between the confidential informant and defendant. \u201cAdmissibility of tape-recorded conversation requires proof of the accuracy or authenticity of the tape by \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 establishing \u2018that the offered evidence is genuine and that there has been no tampering with it\u2019 \u201d (People v Ely, 68 NY2d 520, 527 [1986], quoting People v McGee, 49 NY2d 48, 59 [1979], cert denied sub nom. Waters v New York, 446 US 942 [1980]; see People v Ebron, 90 AD3d 1243, 1245 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 863 [2012]; People v Tillman, 57 AD3d 1021, 1024 [2008]). \u201cAmong other methods, admissibility may be demonstrated by the testimony of a witness to the conversation or to its recording, or by evidence identifying the speakers and establishing the chain of custody of the recording and its unchanged condition\u201d (People v Rendon, 273 AD2d 616, 618 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 968 [2000]; see People v Ely, 68 NY2d at 527-528).\nHere, the foundation for the admission of the tape-recorded conversations was made through the testimony of various detectives overseeing the undercover operation who described the events surrounding the creation of the recordings, identified the voices of the informant and defendant, and set forth a chain of custody of the recordings. The testimony established that the detective operating the recording device immediately reviewed the recordings at the conclusion of the conversations and thereafter secured the recordings in police custody. Just prior to trial, the detective reviewed the tapes again and attested that they were \u201cfair and accurate representations\u201d of the recordings previously made by him. In addition, a second detective testified to knowing defendant for 35 years and identified one voice on the recordings as that of defendant. Hence, the People offered sufficient proof of the accuracy and authenticity of the recordings to establish a legal foundation for their admission into evidence. Any challenge by defendant relating to the reliability of the identification of his voice or inaudibility of the recording goes to the weight of the evidence, not the admissibility (see People v McGee, 49 NY2d at 60).\nNext, we find unavailing defendant\u2019s contention that the presentence report was inadequate because it did not include an updated interview with defendant. \u201c[T]here is no statutory requirement that a statement by the defendant be included in the presentence report\u201d (People v Davila, 238 AD2d 625, 626 [1997]; see CPL 390.30; People v Perea, 27 AD3d 960, 961 [2006]), but the presentence investigation report here in fact contains a statement by defendant regarding the instant offenses. Moreover, defendant declined the opportunity to address County Court at sentencing regarding any inadequacies contained in the report (see People v Ramirez, 90 AD3d 1335, 1336 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 961 [2012]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s sentence was not harsh or excessive. Considering defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history and the quantity of drugs involved in the instant matter, we discern no abuse of discretion by County Court or any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Carter, 97 AD3d 852, 852 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1024 [2012]).\nRose, J.P., Spain and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

The court found that the admission of tape-recorded conversations as evidence was properly established through witness testimony regarding the recordings' authenticity. Furthermore, the court ruled that the presentence report was adequate and that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive given the defendant's criminal history and the nature of the offenses.<|eot_id|>"}

Following County Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress all evidence secured as a result of the recorded telephone conversations, defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the counts against her. Under defendant\u2019s plea agreement, she expressly reserved the right to challenge County Court\u2019s denial of her suppression motion. Defendant was sentenced to a five-year term of probation and this appeal ensued.\nThere should be an affirmance. Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s actual receipt of the CPL 700.50 (3) notice which was served upon her counsel satisfied the statutory requirement of service of the notice upon her (see, People v Weir, 177 AD2d 811; People v Baker, 174 AD2d 815, 817, Iv denied 78 NY2d 920). Nor do we agree with the contention that suppression was required because the statutory notice was not served within \"[90] days after termination of [the] eavesdropping * * * warrant, or expiration of an extension order\u201d (CPL 700.50 [3]). Although the People concede that defendant\u2019s attorney was not served with the notice until February 6, 1989, approximately two weeks following the expiration of the 90-day period, in the absence of a showing of prejudice as a result of the late notice, suppression of the wiretap evidence was properly denied (see, United States v Fury, 554 F2d 522, 527-529, cert denied sub nom. Quinn v United States 433 US 910, 436 US 931; People v Madori, 153 AD2d 287, 295-299). The general notification provision of CPL 700.50 (3) merely affords an \"opportunity to find out who has been poking into your private life and why and with what results\u201d and \"is to be distinguished from CPL 700.70 which adds another specific notification requirement without which evidence secured by an eavesdrop may not be used as evidence\u201d (Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 700.50, at 505; see, People v Madori, supra, at 298-299).\nMikoll, J.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, County Court was to sentence defendant, in accordance with a joint recommendation, to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, provided that he appeared for sentencing. Defendant, however, fled to Florida where he was convicted of additional drug-related crimes. He was extradited to New York and, when he appeared for sentencing, he was sentenced to 4V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision.

In view of this, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary consequences warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Rencher, 65 AD3d 1389, 1390 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 910 [2009]; see also People v Johnson, 20 AD3d 591, 592 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 807 [2005]).\nGarry, J.R, Egan Jr., Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.

In satisfaction of the charges in the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 9 years pursuant to the plea agreement, and now appeals.\nDefendant argues that the indictment must be dismissed because it was not signed by the grand jury foreperson as required by statute (see CPL 200.50 [8]). Defendant did not move to dismiss the indictment on this ground and waived his right to appeal as part of his plea, so this unpreserved argument is reviewable as of right only if the missing signature renders the indictment jurisdictionally defective (see People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978]; People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 681 [2002]; People v Diaz, 233 AD2d 777, 777 [1996]; People v Webb, 177 AD2d 524 [1991], lv denied 79 NY2d 924 [1992]).\nMore than a century ago, the Court of Appeals held that where an indictment did not include the grand jury foreperson\u2019s indorsement but the grand jury appeared in open court to duly present the indictment, it is assumed that it was presented according to law; the certification is not part of the indictment but merely statutory proof of authentication, and the record of personal appearance before the court evidences the authentication (see Brotherton v People, 75 NY 159, 162 [1878]). Similarly, here, the foreperson\u2019s signature was absent from the indictment, but when it was handed up and unsealed, the foreperson was present in court and swore under oath that the indictment \u2014 described by caption, indictment number and counts \u2014 had been voted upon as a true bill by the required number of grand jurors. While a technical violation of the statute (see CPL 200.50 [8]), and not to be condoned as a routine practice, this procedure satisfied the purpose of authentication. Questions regarding the sufficiency of grand jury evidence were addressed by defendant through appropriate motions (see CPL 210.30). Hence, the indictment should not be dismissed, and complaints regarding this technical, nonjurisdictional defect were forfeited by defendant\u2019s plea of guilty (see People v Cox, 275 AD2d 924, 925 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 962 [2000]).\nBecause we find the indictment valid, we reject defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument based on counsel\u2019s failure to move to dismiss the indictment for lack of the foreperson\u2019s signature. Finally, defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal precludes his challenge to the severity of the sentence (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Ackerley, 297 AD2d 861, 862 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 554 [2002]; People v Wade, 297 AD2d 877, 877 [2002]), which, in any event, is meritless. The sentence was agreed upon as part of defendant\u2019s plea to one of several counts of the indictment.

Thereafter, on July 12, 1985, she was indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.

Initially, we note that while defendant refers to this issue as the constitutional right to a speedy trial (see, US Const 6th and 14th Amends; CPL 30.20), her arguments at the hearing and on this appeal refer to the statutory right to a speedy trial (see, CPL 30.30). To the extent that defendant\u2019s motion was based on the statutory right, defendant\u2019s guilty plea operates as a waiver of this claim (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 6; People v Thill, 52 NY2d 1020, cert denied 454 US 829). Moreover, while a claim based on the constitutional right is not so waived (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 5), a consideration of the factors enumerated in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442, 445) demonstrates that defendant was not denied her constitutional right to a speedy trial.\nWe find without merit defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence she received is harsh and excessive. As a rule, we will not interfere with County Court\u2019s discretion to impose sentence in the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion (People v Cyr, 119 AD2d 901, lv denied 68 NY2d 756). Here, defendant was apprised of the sentence to be imposed at the time she entered her plea. In light of the circumstances of this case and defendant\u2019s status as a previously convicted felon, we can discern neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Main, Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., and Levine, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a controlled substance after she pleaded guilty. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds was denied, with the court noting that her guilty plea waived the statutory claim, and her constitutional speedy trial claim was found to be without merit based on relevant factors.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Madison County, rendered October 16, 1975, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a maximum of life and a minimum of one year. In December of 1974, the Grand Jury of Madison County indicted defendant for the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.18, subd 4), and in the third degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.16, subd 6). Upon his arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty to both charges and subsequently moved, inter alia, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence before the Grand Jury was insufficient. Finding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the indictment, however, the County Court denied this motion on September 23, 1975, and immediately thereafter and as a result of plea bargaining, it was agreed by the parties that defendant would withdraw his plea of not guilty to both charges and enter a plea of guilty to the second count, criminal possession in the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictment. It was likewise agreed that defendant would receive an indeterminate sentence of one year to life, and he was sentenced accordingly on October 16, 1975. On this appeal, defendant initially contends that the indictment against him should have been dismissed because the evidence before the Grand Jury was provided by accomplices and uncorroborated. Perusal of the Grand Jury minutes leads us to conclude otherwise. Assuming arguendo that the main witness before the Grand Jury was an accomplice and that the defendant was not foreclosed by his guilty plea from raising this argument on appeal, the testimony of the alleged accomplice was such that a jury might be reasonably satisfied that the accomplice was telling the truth (cf. People v Daniels, 37 NY2d 624, 630). Moreover, the testimony of the undercover agent, given after investigation and surveillance, established that the defendant was in the company of persons possessing and preparing for sale large quantities of drugs (People v Daniels, supra) and thus tended to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense (CPL 60.22, subd 1). The corroborating testimony harmonized with the accomplice\u2019s narrative so as to have a tendency to furnish the necessary connection between the defendant and the crime (People v Morhouse, 21 NY2d 66, 74). Accordingly, the indictment was properly sustained. Similarly without merit are defendant\u2019s contentions that he should have been placed on life probation in lieu of the sentence imposed and that the County Court should have required the District Attorney to include a recommendation for parole in a statement pursuant to subdivision 4 of section 214 of the Correction Law. No extraordinary circumstances are presented to justify our disturbance of the sentence (People v Dittmar, 41 AD2d 788; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861), which was clearly authorized for the class A-III felony conviction here (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subds 2, 3). As to the cited section of the Correction Law, that relates to reports by prison wardens to the Board of Parole and was obviously misconstrued by defendant. We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without substance. Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J. P., Sweeney, Main, Larkin and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Madison County sentenced the defendant to an indeterminate prison term of one year to life after he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The defendant appealed, arguing that the indictment should have been dismissed due to insufficient evidence, primarily from an accomplice. However, the court upheld the indictment, finding sufficient corroborating evidence that connected the defendant to the crime, and affirmed the sentence, rejecting his claims for probation and parole recommendations as without merit.<|eot_id|>"}

His failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders defendant\u2019s arguments unpreserved for our review (see People v Adams, 26 AD3d 597, 598 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 751 [2006]; People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841, 842 [1993]). In any event, were we to reach these issues, we would find them without merit. A review of the record supports the conclusion that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty with a full understanding of its consequences. Defendant\u2019s responses to County Court\u2019s questions belie his contention that he was rushed or misled into accepting the plea agreement (see People v Douglas, 38 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 843 [2007]). We would also find without merit defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed violated the terms of the plea agreement. The court stated that \u201cthere is a possibility, but no promise\u201d that any cooperation by defendant in a pending federal investigation against him could favorably impact the ultimate sentence imposed in the instant matter. However, the court clearly stated that pursuant to the plea agreement defendant could receive eight years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision.\nLikewise, defendant failed to preserve his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and nothing suggests that the alleged \u201ccareless representation at sentencing\u201d impacted the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Justice, 283 AD2d 665 [2001]). Finally, given defendant\u2019s criminal history, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Sherald, 45 AD3d 973 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 771 [2008]; People v Guillermo, 254 AD2d 527, 528 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 1032 [1998]).\nSpain, Carpinello, Kavanagh and Stein, JJ., concur.

The defendant's challenges to the plea's voluntariness and the sentence's adherence to the plea agreement were deemed unpreserved and without merit, as the record indicated he understood the plea's consequences. Additionally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were also unpreserved and did not affect the plea's voluntariness, leading to the affirmation of the judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant\u2019s counsel, the Public Defend er\u2019s office, negotiated a plea agreement whereby defendant, in satisfaction of the entire indictment, would plead guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waive his right to appeal; in exchange, defendant would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 3V2 to 7 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, and after expressing dissatisfaction with his representation, defendant was assigned new counsel and afforded an adjournment to submit a motion, subsequently denied, to withdraw his guilty plea.\nAt sentencing, County Count departed from the original plea agreement and imposed instead an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years, doing so because defendant had breached the agreement by challenging the validity of his prior conviction which served as the basis for his status as a second felony offender. Defendant appeals from both the judgment of conviction and the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment made pursuant to CPL 440.10 and 440.20.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s claim that the representation furnished him by both the Public Defender and subsequently assigned counsel was less than effective. The record reveals that defense counsel participated in disclosure, negotiated a favorable plea bargain, communicated with defendant about his case and, further \u2014 at defendant\u2019s urging \u2014 moved to withdraw his plea and also made a postsentencing motion to vacate the plea. In short, the record is replete with evidence evincing that defendant received meaningful legal representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147).\nThat County Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s application to withdraw his guilty plea is borne out by the fact that, before entering the plea, defendant was fully informed of his rights, assured County Court that his plea was not the product of coercion and that he was not under the influence of alcohol or medication, and unequivocally admitted committing the acts comprising the crime. As County Court\u2019s inquiry of defendant was sufficiently searching to ensure that defendant was aware of his rights and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived them, the court cannot be faulted for denying defendant\u2019s request (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; 711; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 798, lv denied 93 NY2d 980). And as the record amply supports County Court\u2019s conclusion that defendant breached the plea agreement by spuriously claiming that his prior felony conviction was constitutionally infirm, the court was not obliged to abide by the terms of the original plea agreement.\nCardona, P. J., Mikoll, Crew III and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment and order are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance following his guilty plea. The court found that the defendant received effective legal representation and that his request to withdraw the plea was properly denied, as he had been fully informed of his rights and willingly admitted to the crime. Additionally, the court determined that the defendant breached the plea agreement by challenging his prior conviction, justifying the imposition of a longer sentence than initially agreed upon.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to a negotiated bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged that he provided the cocaine which Quitllet sold, fully intending to share in the profits. At sentencing, defendant moved to vacate his guilty plea, contending that he had a valid entrapment defense. This application was precipitated by Quitllet\u2019s recent acquittal at trial on the basis of entrapment. County Court denied the application without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accord with the plea bargain to an indeterminate term of 8 l\u00f3-years-to-life imprisonment.\nOn this appeal, defendant argues that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate the plea and that the sentence was excessive. We find neither contention persuasive. A guilty plea may not generally be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in inducing the plea (see, People v Cooke, 61 AD2d 1060, 1061). Resolution of a withdrawal application rests within the trial court\u2019s discretion (CPL 220.60 [3]; see, People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677). Although no specific reference to entrapment was made, a review of the plea minutes confirms that defendant fully discussed the ramifications of his plea with counsel (compare, People v Johnson, 91 AD2d 782, 783). Defendant\u2019s suggestion that Quitllet\u2019s acquittal revealed previously unknown facts supporting an entrapment defense is sharply contradicted by his specific admission of a profit motive during the plea colloquy. Given these circumstances, County Court could readily determine that defendant\u2019s belated claim of entrapment was without substance (see, People v Austin, 117 AD2d 835, 836; People v Kelsch, supra; People v Johnson, supra).\nFinally, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed, which was within the scope of the plea agreement and the pertinent statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [a]; [4] [a]).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P.

The defendant had sought to vacate his plea based on a claimed entrapment defense after a co-defendant's acquittal, but the court found no substance in this claim as the defendant had previously admitted his involvement and profit motive. The court upheld the sentence as it fell within the agreed plea terms and statutory guidelines.<|eot_id|>"}

Inasmuch as the record reflects that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal as part of his guilty plea, his challenge to the harshness of the sentence imposed has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Cuevas [Carlito] [Manny], 234 AD2d 804, lvs denied 89 NY2d 940, 941, 944).

He engaged in pretrial motion practice that included, among other things, applications to suppress the informant\u2019s identification of him to police and place him in the Judicial Diversion Program. After that relief was denied, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal. As contemplated by the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to five years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Upon our review of the thorough plea colloquy and the detailed written waiver executed by defendant, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1489-1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]). Defendant is accordingly precluded from arguing that County Court erred in refusing to either suppress identification evidence (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]) or grant him judicial diversion (see People v Brown, 122 AD3d 1006, 1007 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).\nDefendant also challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, while that issue survives his appeal waiver, the apparent lack of an appropriate postallocution motion leaves it unpreserved for our review (see People v Mann, 140 AD3d 1532, 1533 [2016]; People v White, 139 AD3d 1260, 1260 [2016]). Despite defendant\u2019s protestations to the contrary, nothing was said during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea so as to implicate the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Austin, 141 AD3d 956, 957 [2016]).\nDefendant next contends that the indictment was jurisdic-tionally defective which, unlike his speculation that deficiencies might be found in the grand jury minutes, survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d 979, 979-980 [2015]). The indictment was jurisdictionally valid, however, as the count to which defendant pleaded guilty recited the specific section of the Penal Law under which he was charged and did not need to specify the exact subset of cocaine he sold (see People v Rapp, 133 AD3d at 980; People v Moon, 119 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1004 [2014]).\nThe claims advanced by defendant in his pro se supplemental brief largely echo those raised by appellate counsel and addressed above.

Defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in failing to conduct further inquiry when the plea colloquy cast doubt upon the voluntariness of his plea.\nFirst, defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders this issue unpreserved (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635-636 [2001]). In any event, defendant claims that his negative response to County Court\u2019s question, \u201cDo you agree there is nobody forcing you to [plead guilty]?,\u201d should have triggered further inquiry from the court because it reflects the fact that his plea may have been the product of coercion. However, when defendant\u2019s statement is read in the context of the entire allocution, a more persuasive reading of his response is that he was, in fact, stating that he was not under any duress to plead guilty. The response thus falls well short of calling into question the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea (see People v Lopez, supra; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]).

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to SVs years to life in prison on his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and 3 to 9 years in prison for his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, said sentences to run concurrently. In July 2005, defendant moved to set aside or modify his sentence on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree pursuant to the provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (see L 2005, ch 643). Following a resentencing hearing, County Court vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and resentenced him to a determinate sentence of 8V3 years in prison together with five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals from the original judgment of conviction, as well as the judgment and amended judgment resentencing him.\nWe affirm. While there is merit to defendant\u2019s claim that he did not effectively waive his right to appeal at the time of his plea and sentencing in 2002, our review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived such right at the time of resentencing. Nevertheless, were we to consider his argument that the abbreviated sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we would reject such contention. Defendant\u2019s sentence of 3 to 9 years for his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and his resentence to a determinate prison term of 8V3 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree clearly were within the permissible statutory range, and we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction thereof (see People v Thompson, 33 AD3d 1131, 1131 [2006]).\nMugglin, Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

The court found the sentences imposed were within the statutory range and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.<|eot_id|>"}

The County Court (Gazzillo, J.) advised the defendant, inter alia, that if he was rearrested, the court would not be bound by its promise and would impose any appropriate sentence up to 25 years of imprisonment, which was the maximum allowable sentence. After entering into his plea agreement, the defendant was arrested. The County Court sentenced the defendant, among other things, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 21h to 7 years on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree.\nSubsequently, the County Court was informed that it had illegally sentenced the defendant to an indeterminate term of imprisonment on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, which was a violent felony requiring a determinate sentence. The County Court (Efman, J.), over the defendant\u2019s objection, resentenced the defendant to a determinate term of imprisonment of two years plus two years of post-release supervision on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the County Court properly resentenced the defendant. A trial court has the inher ent power to correct an illegal sentence, over a defendant\u2019s objection, where the corrected sentence falls within the range initially stated by the court (see People v DeValle, 94 NY2d 870, 871-872 [2000]; People v Williams, 87 NY2d 1014 [1996]). Here, after the County Court learned that the indeterminate sentence imposed on the defendant for the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree was illegal, it exercised its inherent power to correct the sentence by imposing a determinate term of imprisonment of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This sentence was within the range initially stated by the County Court, as it was less than the 25 years of imprisonment that could have been imposed on the defendant, since he was arrested after his plea and the County Court was no longer bound by its promised sentence.\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, under the circumstances of this case, his plea was not rendered unknowing or involuntary simply because the County Court did not advise him that the crime of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree was a violent felony (see generally People v Brinkhuis, 44 AD3d 677 [2007]; cf. People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242 [2005]). Mastro, J.E, Hall, Lott and Sgroi, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed his resentence for multiple convictions, including criminal sale of a firearm, which was initially imposed as an indeterminate term but later corrected by the County Court to a determinate term of two years in prison plus two years of post-release supervision, due to the original sentence being illegal. The court affirmed the resentencing, stating that it had the authority to correct the sentence and that the new sentence fell within the range initially stated. Additionally, the court found that the defendant's plea remained valid and voluntary despite not being informed that the firearm offense was a violent felony.<|eot_id|>"}

On appeal, he argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We find defendant\u2019s first contention to be without merit. Although defendant had difficulty deciding whether to plead guilty or to proceed to trial, he was fully informed of the ramifications of pleading guilty and communicated his understanding to County Court prior to entering his plea.

Nevertheless, were we to consider this claim, we would find that it is also without merit.

Defendant, after conferring with counsel, agreed to plead guilty and, in exchange, defendant was promised a sentence of no more than six months in jail and a five-year period of probation. Defendant also agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a written waiver. Defendant acknowledged that he understood that he was giving up certain rights associated with a jury trial and then stated that he \u201cwas an accomplice to a third party\u201d who sold marihuana to another person, and that the marihuana weighed more than four ounces. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to a four-month jail term and a five-year period of probation. He now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea, while not encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal, is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Ward, 2 AD3d 1219, 1219 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 808 [2004]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt such as to negate an essential element of the crime (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ward, supra at 1219). In any event, were we to consider defendant\u2019s argument, we would find it to be without merit as \u201cdefendant\u2019s affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s questions established the elements of the crime[ ] charged and there is no indication in the record that the voluntary plea was baseless or improvident\u201d (People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]; see People v Baker, 301 AD2d 868, 869 [2003], lv dismissed 99 NY2d 625 [2003]).\nGiven the knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Hughes, 3 AD3d 736, 737 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Her cure, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to consecutive sentences of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, on the criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal sale of a controlled substance convictions, and ordered restitution in the amount of $300 for each conviction. The court also sentenced defendant to one year in jail for the criminal contempt conviction. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends that, by imposing the one-year sentence on the criminal contempt conviction, County Court improperly enhanced his sentence without offering him an opportunity to withdraw his plea. While this issue survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to object on this ground at sentencing or move to withdraw his plea on this basis (see People v Raleigh, 121 AD3d 1412, 1413 [2014]; People v DePalma, 99 AD3d 1116, 1116-1117 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1010 [2013]).\nDefendant also contends that County Court improperly ordered $300 in restitution on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 1-80-2014. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the People requested and defendant agreed to pay $300 in restitution on his conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in satisfaction of indictment No. 1-83-2014, which represented funds used in a controlled buy. Although there was no similar agreement regarding the guilty plea to the criminal possession charge in satisfaction of indictment No. 1-80-2014, the People requested the restitution at sentencing, without offering any evidence in support of restitution under this charge. Although defendant\u2019s challenge to the restitution ordered for the criminal possession conviction is unpreserved due to his failure to request a hearing or object at the time of sentencing (see People v Vasavada, 93 AD3d 893, 894 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 978 [2012]; People v Drayton, 79 AD3d 1529, 1530 [2010]), we find it appropriate to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment is modified by reversing the sentence only insofar as it directs defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $300 pursuant to his conviction under indictment No. 1-80-2014 and remit the matter for the sole purpose of a restitution hearing or a redetermination of restitution (see People v Morehouse, 140 AD3d 1202, 1204 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 934 [2016]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 970 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 1153 [2016]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr., Lynch and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reversing so much thereof as ordered restitution in the amount of $300 pursuant to defendant\u2019s conviction under indictment No. 1-80-2014; matter remitted to the County Court of Franklin County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nDefendant was charged in indictment No. I-80-2014 with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and speeding in violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.

If no enforceable waiver of the right to appeal exists, defendant could challenge whether the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, supra at 253-254, 257). Inasmuch as we cannot conclude that raising such a challenge would be \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d and without making any finding as to the ultimate merit of such issue, the application of defendant\u2019s current counsel to be relieved of his assignment is granted and new counsel will be assigned to address any issue that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

The appellate court identified a potential issue regarding the validity of the waiver, which could allow the defendant to contest the severity of his sentence. Consequently, the court granted the application for the defendant's current counsel to be relieved and appointed new counsel to explore any issues arising from the record.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s assertion otherwise, his factual recitation during the plea allocution did not cast doubt on his guilt, negate an essential element of the crime or call into question the voluntariness of his plea. On the contrary, although the police discovered crack cocaine in the backyard of defendant\u2019s neighbor, defendant informed County Court that they were his drugs, he had hidden the drugs there and he intended to sell them. He likewise acknowledged his understanding of the ramifications of pleading guilty, stated that he had all the time he needed to discuss the matter with his attorney and that he was entering the guilty plea freely and voluntarily. Accordingly, we find that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea (see People v First, 62 AD3d 1043, 1044 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 915 [2009]; People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]) and that his description of the underlying facts was sufficient to establish the elements of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1]).\nDefendant next contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to make certain pretrial motions. However, \u201c[t]he fact that defense counsel did not request a particular pretrial hearing does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d (People v Jackson, 67 AD3d 1067, 1068 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 801 [2010]). Moreover, counsel negotiated a favorable plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on his effectiveness (see People v Singletary, 51 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 741 [2008]; People v Lee, 51 AD3d 1217, 1217-1218 [2008]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining argument, to the extent that it is properly before us, is unpersuasive.\nMercure, J.P., McCarthy, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

The court found that the plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently, with the defendant acknowledging the drugs belonged to him and understanding the consequences of his plea. Additionally, the court rejected the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, noting that the attorney's actions did not undermine the effectiveness of the defense.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s claim of judicial bias is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Kilgore, 45 AD3d 886, 887 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 767 [2008]; People v McCafferty, 1 AD3d 799, 799 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 743 [2004]) and unpreserved for our review given his \u201cfailure to make a motion or otherwise request County Court to recuse itself from the case\u201d (People v Rizzo, 5 AD3d 924, 925 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 646 [2004]; see People v Mao-Sheng Lin, 50 AD3d 1251, 1253 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 961 [2008]).

By order dated August 20, 1979, this court remitted the matter to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court for further proceedings with respect to his disapproval of a sentence of lifetime probation and the appeal has been held in abeyance in the interim (People v Nudelman, 70 AD2d 13). The Administrative Judge has complied. Judgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence to a term of lifetime probation. As so modified, judgment affirmed and case remitted to the County Court, Nassau County, to fix the conditions of probation. On January 22, 1979 defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class A-III felony, in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fifth degrees. Pursuant to section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law, the sentencing court forwarded a letter dated February 15, 1979 to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court stating that in his opinion the ends of justice would best be served by imposing a sentence of lifetime probation on the defendant and requesting concurrence in the imposition of such a sentence. The request was denied by the Administrative Judge by crossing out the word \"approved\u201d at the foot of the letter, leaving the word \"disapproved\u201d. No reasons were stated. On April 3, 1979 the County Court imposed an indeterminate term of imprisonment of a minimum of one year and a maximum of life, the minimum sentence permissible in the absence of the concurrence of the Administrative Judge. This court held the appeal from the judgment of conviction in abeyance and remitted the matter to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court for a statement of the basis for his determination and for the taking of proof if he deemed it necessary or advisable to do so (People v Nudelman, supra, opn per Mollen, P. J.). Pursuant to our remission the Administrative Judge has rendered an opinion, dated August 30, 1979, without a hearing, setting forth the basis for his denial of the application. As we held upon remitting this matter, the discretion exercised by an Administrative Judge in denying an application for concurrence in the imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation is reviewable. Pursuant to that power of review we find that such discretion was not properly exercised in this case and that the sentence should be reduced to lifetime probation. Section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law provides that the court, with the concurrence of either the Administrative Judge of the court or the Administrative Judge of the judicial district, may impose a sentence of probation upon a person convicted of a class A-III felony if the prosecutor recommends such a sentence on the ground that the defendant has or is providing material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of any person for a felony defined in article 220 of the Penal Law. Four criteria are set forth to guide the court in the exercise of its discretion: (i) that institutional confinement of the defendant is not necessary for the protection of the public; (ii) that guidance, training or other assistance can be provided to the defendant through probation supervision; (iii) that the defendant has or is providing material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of a person for a felony pursuant to article 220 of the Penal Law; and (iv) that such a sentence would not be inconsistent with the ends of justice. In this case the District Attorney of Nassau County recommended that the court impose a sentence of probation on the basis that the defendant had provided assistance in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of major felony violators as defined in article 220. That recommendation was supported by a letter from an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration Stating that as the result of the defendant\u2019s co-operation two cases were initiated, one of which resulted in the purchase of one ounce of cocaine and another of which resulted in the purchase of approximately 1,000 noncontrolled pills and that both investigations were still active. The presentence report prepared by the Nassau County Probation Department indicated that the defendant was a student at Adelphi University at the time of his arrest and that he had no prior criminal record and recommended that he be considered for lifetime probation. The report did reveal that an A-III felony charge was pending against the defendant in Suffolk County. In our opinion, as implicitly found by the sentencing court, all the criteria set forth by the Legislature in enacting section 65.00 have been met in this case. The nature and circumstances of the crime indicate that institutional confinement is not necessary for the protection of the public. Clearly, the necessary guidance, training or other assistance can be effectively administered through probation supervision. The District Attorney, whose expertise places him in the best position to evaluate the matter, has stated that the defendant has provided assistance in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of major violators of felonies as defined in article 220 of the Penal Law. Plainly, the imposition of probation here is not inconsistent with the ends of justice. This would seem to be a case in which no worthwhile purpose is to be served by incarceration of the defendant. In his written opinion the Administrative Judge of the County Court addressed himself only to the criterion relating to the providing of material assistance in connection with other criminal investigations and concluded, based upon a comparison of the criminal acts committed by the defendant and the investigations for which he had provided assistance, notwithstanding the statements of the District Attorney, that the defendant had not in fact provided the requisite material assistance. However, in so doing, the Administrative Judge indicated that his finding was influenced by a basic dissatisfaction with the statutory sentencing scheme by pointing out that many defendants convicted of class A-I or A-II drug felonies who themselves may have been unsophisticated youngsters who became involved in a single transaction would have willingly co-operated with law enforcement authorities in exchange for a sentence of probation if the statute had afforded them the opportunity to do so. He concluded as follows: \"In the light of this defendant\u2019s involvement and failure to demonstrate substantial cooperation of the type contemplated by the statute, it would not appear to be in the interest of justice to accord him this special treatment not available to others less involved, and through no fault of their own incapable of cooperating to the extent required.\u201d In sum we find that the refusal by the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court to concur in the imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation in this case constituted an improvident exercise of discretion. Hopkins, Titone and Shapiro, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance and initially received an indeterminate prison sentence. The appellate court found that the Administrative Judge's disapproval of a lifetime probation request was an improper exercise of discretion, as the defendant had provided substantial assistance in ongoing criminal investigations. Consequently, the court modified the sentence to lifetime probation, remitting the case to the County Court to establish the probation conditions.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. While the sentence was the harshest statutorily allowed for the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty, defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of a two- count indictment. In light of these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). We also find no basis for reversal in the People\u2019s withdrawal of an initial plea bargain which was more lenient (see, People v Johnson, 181 AD2d 832, lv denied 80 NY2d 833; Matter of Gold v Booth, 79 AD2d 691, lv denied 52 NY2d 706, cert denied sub nom.

County Court denied defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, to a prison term of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that County Court abused its discretion in summarily denying his motion to withdraw his plea. It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the nature and extent of the fact-finding procedures necessary to decide a motion to withdraw a guilty plea and a limited interrogation by the court will often be sufficient (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 544 [1993]; People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927 [1974]; People v Riddick, 136 AD3d 1124, 1124 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1154 [2016]). \u201cAn evidentiary hearing will be required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to the plea\u2019s voluntariness\u201d (People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1116 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; see People v Brown, 14 NY3d 113, 116 [2010]).\nHere, defendant moved to withdraw his plea on the basis that he continued to be harassed and threatened by a code-fendant, that he was innocent and that his guilty plea would result in his deportation. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that County Court explained, and defendant acknowledged that he understood, the deportation consequences of the guilty plea (see People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d 1315, 1317 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). Additionally, the continued threats and harassment by a codefendant do not undermine the voluntariness of the plea. Finally, defendant\u2019s sworn admissions during the plea allocution contradict his conclusory and unsupported claim of innocence (see People v Crispell, 136 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1149 [2016]; People v Barton, 126 AD3d 1238, 1239 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1142 [2016]).\nNext, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid because he was not advised that his right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights that he automatically forfeited by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Beverly, 137 AD3d 1421, 1422 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1128 [2016]). As such, his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is not precluded. Nevertheless, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed. We note that the agreed-upon sentence was significantly less than the maximum statutorily permitted sentence (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [a] [i]). Furthermore, our review of the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion to warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v White, 122 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2014]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Devine and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after pleading guilty and subsequently moving to withdraw that plea, claiming harassment and innocence. The court found no abuse of discretion in denying the motion, as the defendant had acknowledged understanding the plea's consequences, and his claims did not undermine its voluntariness. Although the waiver of appeal rights was deemed invalid, the court upheld the sentence as appropriate and not excessively harsh, affirming the judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant was indicted in a multiple count indictment charged with the criminal sale and possession of dangerous drugs and, thereafter, was permitted to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and enter one of guilty to the first count charging criminally selling a dangerous drug in the second degree in violation of section 220.35, in disposition of the indictment. Upon resentencing defendant, in the presence of his attorney, stated that the reason he entered a guilty plea was so that he \u201cwould get the narcotics program\u201d and, if this be interpreted as an application to withdraw said plea, the County Court did not err or abuse its discretion in not granting same since defendant, who stated he was changing his plea because he was guilty and for no other reason, did not present nor does the record reveal justification for such withdrawal (cf. People v. McKennion, 27 N Y 2d 671; People v. Beasley, 25 N Y 2d 483, 488). In connection with a coram nobis application determined by an order entered September 16, 1970, the County Court found, after a hearing, that defendant was not deceived into pleading guilty by anyone, although he did indicate after the imposition of sentence that he was disappointed as to the extent of the sentence.

He was sentenced to five years of probation, the terms of which included, among other things, that he successfully complete the Albany County drug court program. County Court explained that, under the plea agreement, if defendant failed to complete the program or otherwise violated a condition of probation, his probation would be revoked and he would be sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of no less than seven years or more than eight years, with three years of postrelease supervision. In 2015, defendant pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation by, among other things, being arrested and failing to complete the drug court program, and he waived the right to appeal. County Court revoked his probation and sentenced him, as a second felony drug offender, to seven years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid (see People v Bartlett, 148 AD3d 1468, 1469 [2017]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]). Defendant\u2019s contention that his guilty plea to the probation violation was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary survives his appeal waiver but is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Woodard, 139 AD3d 1238, 1238 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 939 [2016]; People v Secore, 102 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1019 [2013]). Moreover, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt or cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Jones, 139 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]; People v McGregor, 119 AD3d 1235, 1236 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 991 [2015]). Similarly, to the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims implicate the voluntariness of his plea, such claims survive his valid appeal waiver but are not preserved for our review absent an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1563-1564 [2017]; People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]).\nDefendant also contends that his federal drug conspiracy conviction does not qualify as a predicate New York felony and, therefore, it cannot serve as a basis for his second felony drug offender adjudication. Although this claim is being raised for the first time on appeal, we find that the claim \u201cfalls within the narrow exception to our preservation rule permitting appellate review when a sentence\u2019s illegality is readily discernible from the . . . record\u201d (People v Santiago, 22 NY3d 900, 903 [2013]; see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52, 55-56 [2000]; People v Martinez, 130 AD3d 1087, 1088 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]). In the special information charging a predicate offense, the People alleged that defendant was previously convicted in the US District Court for the Northern District of New York of conspiracy to distribute marihuana (21 USC \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846). However, the Court of Appeals has determined that, \u201cunder New York\u2019s \u2018strict equivalency standard for convictions rendered in other jurisdictions, a federal conviction for conspiracy to commit a drug crime may not serve as a predicate felony for sentencing purposes\u201d (People v Ramos, 19 NY3d 417, 418 [2012]). We therefore vacate the sentence and remit the matter to County Court for resentencing (see People v Parker, 121 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2014]).\nEgan Jr., Devine, Mulvey and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for resentencing; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nTo the extent that defendant also challenges his guilty plea to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, those arguments are not before us inasmuch as he did not appeal from that judgment (see People v Brodsky, 16 AD3d 842, 843 [2005]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal arises from a judgment revoking the defendant's probation for failing to complete a drug court program and imposing a prison sentence. The court affirmed that the defendant's waiver of the right to appeal was valid, but it vacated the sentence based on the defendant's claim that his federal drug conspiracy conviction did not qualify as a predicate felony under New York law.

Defendants were jointly indicted with two others for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and other offenses. Their pleas of guilty to reduced charges of criminal possession of cocaine in the second degree were accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. We find no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the mandatory sentence provisions of section 70.00 of the Penal Law constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and are greatly disproportionate to the offenses committed. The constitutionality of this statute is beyond challenge (People v Jones, 39 NY2d 694; People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). The defendants urge that this is that \"rare case\u201d which forbids routine application of the statute (see People v Broadie, supra, p 119). However, the record fails to disclose any circumstances which render the case unusual and different in any way from other criminal possession cases. Defendants contend cocaine is improperly classified as a narcotic drug for purposes of criminal punishment. We see no merit to this argument. The classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug rests entirely within the province of the Legislature and does not come within the ambit of our authority (see People v Portanova, 56 AD2d 265, 277). Without a showing of irrationality, we are unable to overturn the classification scheme. Defendants also argue that they were denied their rights to a prompt preliminary hearing (CPL 180.10, subd 2) and to appear before the Grand Jury (CPL 190.50, subd 5, par [a]). It is apparent even under the procedural scheme adopted by the Legislature in 1970 (L 1970, ch 996) that a defendant may be indicted while awaiting disposition of a felony complaint in a local criminal court (CPL 190.50, subd 5, par [a]; People v Talham, 41 AD2d 354), thus obviating any need for a preliminary hearing. Defendants were processed \"promptly\u201d as the indictment came down nine days after arrest. As for defendants\u2019 objection that they were denied their right to appear before the Grand Jury, CPL 190.50 (subd 5, par [c]) requires any objections to the indictment based on paragraph (a) of that subdivision to be raised within five days of the arraignment on the indictment (People v Washington, 42 AD2d 677). In this case objections were raised a year and one-half later. This was untimely. We have considered defendants\u2019 other contentions and have found them to be without merit. Judgments affirmed. Greenblott, J. P., Sweeney, Main, Mikoll and Herlihy, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal involves defendants convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, who received mandatory sentences ranging from six years to life after pleading guilty to reduced charges. The court found no merit in the defendants' claims that the mandatory sentencing was cruel and unusual punishment, upheld the classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug, and ruled that any objections regarding their rights to a preliminary hearing and Grand Jury appearance were untimely. Consequently, the judgments of the County Court were affirmed.<|eot_id|>"}

He was later charged by superior court information with the crime of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. In satisfaction of all pending charges, he pleaded guilty to the criminal possession and promoting prison contraband charges. After lengthy negotiation, it was agreed that defendant would not waive his right to appeal and he would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years for the criminal possession charge and 1 to 3 years for the promoting prison contraband charge, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, involuntariness of his plea, and excessiveness of his sentence.\nIn support of his claim of ineffective assistance, defendant contends that trial counsel misapprehended the facts surrounding the issuance and execution of the search warrant, that counsel failed to challenge the police officers\u2019 execution of the warrant by the search of three separate structures, and that counsel failed to move to suppress the results of the search. In making our assessment, we are guided that \u201c[s]o long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation, the constitutional requirement will have been met\u201d (People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Here, the record reveals that defense counsel familiarized himself with all relevant legal issues and reviewed all necessary documents concerning the warrant. His failure to move to suppress the evidence seized does not necessarily indicate ineffectiveness (see, People v Wagner, 104 AD2d 457, 458). While police authorities may have visited other structures in executing the warrant, the critical evidence seized was all located in defendant\u2019s residence. Moreover, the record fails to provide any support for defendant\u2019s assertion that he would have standing to challenge the visits to the other structures (see, People v Ponder, 54 NY2d 160).\nAs to the plea, we discern no error in the allocution and find it evident that defense counsel negotiated an extremely favorable result (see, People v Ruger, 279 AD2d 795, lv denied 96 NY2d 806). \u201c[W]hile a guilty plea does not preclude inquiry into the effectiveness of defense counsel in making pretrial motions * * *, the fact that a favorable plea bargain was struck is a factor to be considered\u201d (People v Strempack, 134 AD2d 799, 800, affd 71 NY2d 1015 [citation omitted]).\nTurning to the sentence, we note that upon defendant\u2019s articulation of his plea, he asserted that this was his \u201cfirst offense.\u201d The presentence investigation belied this assertion; it revealed that while he had not been convicted of a felony, he had been previously convicted of misdemeanors. Had defendant been tried and convicted on all the pending charges, he could have been sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of up to SVs to 25 years on the crimes for which he was indicted and up to 21/s to 7 years on the charge of promoting prison contraband. With the record revealing no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances that would cause us to interfere with the sentence imposed (see, People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810; People v La Shomb, 285 AD2d 837), we affirm.\nHer cure, J.P., Spain, Carpinello and.

The sentence, which falls within the statutory guidelines, was the agreed-upon result of a plea bargain, pursuant to which a second charge against defendant was dropped.

On April 25, 1988, he pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, as charged in count 25 of the indictment, to cover the indictment. The defendant was told that he would be sentenced to an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment. He was also told that if he were to fail to appear for sentencing, he would be subject to the maximum sentence. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated to the court, \"I believe [the maximum] is six and a third to life\u201d. The court then stated to the defendant, \"[i]f you [were to fail] to return [for sentencing] you would then receive six and a third to [life]\u201d.\nThe defendant did not appear for sentencing. More than two years later, after having been arrested for another drug offense, the defendant finally appeared. His attorney did not allege that the court was obliged to impose a sentence of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment, and in fact requested that the court impose a sentence of 7 years to life imprisonment. The court then imposed a sentence of 7 Vi years to life imprisonment.\nOn the present appeal pursuant to 22 NYCRR 670.12 (c) (1), the defendant does not seek to have his plea of guilty vacated. Instead, he argues that the sentencing court had a duty to impose a term of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment (see, People v Outlaw, 157 AD2d 677; People v Marrero, 162 AD2d 419; People v Gallino, 131 AD2d 695). We disagree.\nThe defendant had no unqualified right to receive a term of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment. Instead, the defendant had the right to choose either to withdraw his guilty plea or to submit to whatever sentence the court, in its discretion, wished to impose (see, e.g., People v Scrivens, 175 AD2d 671; People v Outlaw, supra; People v White, 144 AD2d 711; People v Sumner, 137 AD2d 891; People v Gallino, supra; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709). Because the defendant does not seek to withdraw his guilty plea now, and has never sought that relief in the court of original instance, and because the defendant\u2019s attorney affirmatively requested the imposition of a prison term which exceeded any prior commitment which had been made by the court, we conclude that the defendant may not invoke the rule defined in the cases cited above in order to compel the imposition of a sentence which, in view of his having absconded, and in view of his having been rearrested on another charge, would be inappropriate. We agree with the Supreme Court that, under all the circumstances of this case, any sentence less than that actually imposed would have been inappropriate. Accordingly, the sentence appealed from is affirmed. Mangano, P. J., Bracken, Balletta, O\u2019Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed his indeterminate sentence of 7\u00bd years to life imprisonment for a guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance, arguing he should have received a lesser sentence of 6\u2153 years to life. The court affirmed the sentence, noting that the defendant had no unqualified right to a specific term and that he did not seek to withdraw his plea; instead, he had requested a longer sentence than previously indicated. The court concluded that given the circumstances, including the defendant's failure to appear for sentencing and subsequent arrest, the imposed sentence was appropriate.<|eot_id|>"}

On the day set for trial, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in accordance with a plea bargain which also provided for sentence, as a second felony offender, to an indeterminate prison term of 12 Vi years to life. Following entry of the plea, defendant made a pro se motion for the appointment of substitute counsel and to withdraw his plea of guilty. In accordance with defendant\u2019s request, County Court appointed the Public Defender to represent him and adjourned the matter for one week. On the adjourned date, after hearing argument on the motion, County Court denied defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain and this appeal followed.\nThere should be an affirmance. Initially, we reject the argument that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. Our review of the record discloses no factual support for the contention that defendant\u2019s plea was not voluntary and knowing. At the time of the plea, County Court conducted a searching inquiry and confirmed defendant\u2019s knowledge of the various rights that he was waiving in connection with his plea of guilty. Further, defendant acknowledged that the matter had been extensively discussed with his attorney and indicated that he was accepting the negotiated plea to avoid the possibility of a much greater sentence if he were found guilty after trial. Significantly, defendant was exposed to a possible sentence of 25 years to life (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]). Although defendant did exhibit some reluctance in entering his guilty plea, a fair reading of the plea allocution indicates no evidence of threats or coercion but, rather, defendant\u2019s mere unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation. Defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that over two ounces of cocaine had been knowingly secreted in his car provided a factual predicate for his plea, and he did not profess his innocence at the time of his application in County Court or on appeal to this court (see, People v Bray, 170 AD2d 722, 723; People v Cance, 155 AD2d 764, 764-765).\nWe also reject the contention that County Court should have granted the application, made only one month prior to trial, for substitute counsel. A change of counsel at that stage would have had the inevitable effect of delaying the trial, and our review of the record shows no basis for defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his attorney (see, People v Arroyave, 49 NY2d 264, 271-272; People v Nicholls, 157 AD2d 1004, 1005; People v Berard, 112 AD2d 470, 471): To the contrary, defendant\u2019s attorney sought and obtained discovery, moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the Grand Jury proceedings and on speedy trial grounds, and moved to suppress the evidence obtained as the result of a search of defendant\u2019s automobile. We also note that, although defendant had previously filed a complaint regarding his attorney\u2019s failure to attend certain scheduled proceedings, the attorney\u2019s absence had been adequately explained to County Court and defendant expressed no dissatisfaction with his representation at the time of the plea.\nWeiss, J.

After attempting to withdraw his plea and request substitute counsel, both motions were denied by the County Court, which found the plea was made voluntarily and knowingly.

Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment in full satisfaction thereof and, in accordance with a plea agreement, was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea. Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he has not preserved this issue for our review (see People v Barnes, 302 AD2d 623, 623 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]). Were we to consider defendant\u2019s challenge, we would find it without merit. While the record reflects, as defendant claims, that he was unable to recall the specific sale to which he allocuted, he admitted making numerous cocaine sales, including one sale in Ulster County on the date alleged in the count of the indictment to which he pleaded guilty.\nWe likewise reject defendant\u2019s assertion that County Court erred in failing to assign new counsel and that his trial counsel failed to provide him with meaningful representation. Defendant did not demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution of assigned counsel (see People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]) and, in light of the extremely advantageous plea bargain, we cannot say that defendant received less than meaningful representation (see People v Allen, 301 AD2d 874, 875 [2003]).\nPeters, Spain, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

He contends on this appeal that the sentence was harsh and excessive and requests that it be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree.

A review of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding such waiver (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11) indicates that defendant was not on any drugs or medication at the time of his plea, he discussed the case thoroughly with his attorney, and he was advised in considerable detail by County Court of the rights he would be giving up, including the waiver of his right to appeal. The record further indicates that defendant, who is familiar with the criminal justice system, acknowledged his understanding of the significance of these waivers. In these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911; People v Hanna, 236 AD2d 742, 744, lv denied 89 NY2d 1094; People v Thompson, 234 AD2d 709, lv denied 89 NY2d 1016).\nFurthermore, as defendant failed to move to withdraw or vacate his guilty plea, his further challenge to the knowing, voluntary and intelligent nature of said plea is precluded (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Rojas, 238 AD2d 727, 729), and the limited circumstances that would allow such a challenge in the absence of a formal postallocution motion (see, People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726; People v Lopez, supra, at 666) are not present here. In addition, to the extent that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is preserved for our review (see, People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982), we find no indication in the record that defense counsel\u2019s conduct affected the plea bargaining process or that defendant pleaded guilty as a result of counsel\u2019s poor performance (see, People v McElhiney, 237 AD2d 827, lv denied 90 NY2d 861).\nWe finally find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied due process by the 22-month delay in the perfection of his appeal (see, People v Telesco, 189 AD2d 902, lv denied 81 NY2d 977). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions either lack merit or are not properly before this Court for review.\nMercure, J. P., Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 1.5 to 4.5 years in prison. The appeal focused on the validity of the defendant's waiver of his right to appeal, which was found to be knowing and voluntary, and the court noted that the defendant did not challenge the plea's validity through a formal motion. Additionally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and due process violations due to a delay in the appeal were deemed without merit.<|eot_id|>"}

In any event, the record demonstrates that the defendant violated the unambiguous condition of the plea agreement that he complete the residential drug treatment program. Based on that violation, the court properly imposed the promised enhanced sentence for the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Benn, 23 AD3d 574, 574-575 [2005]; People v Guerra, 291 AD2d 410, 411 [2002]; People v Miles, 268 AD2d 489, 490 [2000]).\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, he was not entitled to be sentenced under the Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738; People v Aviles, 29 AD3d 813 [2006]; People v McCray, 27 AD3d 486 [2006]; People v Torres, 26 AD3d 398 [2006]).\nAs correctly conceded by the People, the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree must be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, to comport with his guilty plea. Moreover, as agreed by the defendant and the People, the sentence for that conviction should be reduced to a determinate term of one year, to run concurrently with the sentence for his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Mastro, J.P, Ritter, Skelos, Carni and McCarthy, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of third-degree criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, resulting in concurrent sentences of 4\u00bd to 9 years. The appellate court modified the judgment by reducing the possession conviction to seventh-degree and the sentence to one year, while affirming the enhanced sentence for the sale conviction due to the defendant's violation of his plea agreement by failing to complete a residential drug treatment program. The court found that the defendant was not entitled to sentencing under the Drug Law Reform Act.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nTom, J.P.\nIn this appeal, defendant asks this Court to exercise its interest-of-justice power to review and reduce his sentence, negotiated pursuant to a plea agreement, on the grounds that his waiver of his right to appeal was invalid and that his sentence was excessive.\nIn February 2013, defendant was arrested after selling crack cocaine and marijuana to an undercover police officer. After apprehending him, the police recovered two credit cards and one photo ID card from his pocket, all belonging to an individual who was not defendant. Defendant was indicted for one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree, and two counts of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.\nBefore trial, defendant agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree in satisfaction of all charges and in exchange for concurrent sentences of 2V2 years on the criminal sale count and IV2 to 3 years on the stolen property count. As part of the bargain, he agreed to waive his right to appeal and judgment was entered as agreed upon.\nNotwithstanding the waiver, defendant appealed to this Court asserting that his appeal waiver was invalid and unenforceable and that his sentence was excessive and should be modified in the interest of justice. We find that the record establishes that defendant was properly apprised of the implications of waiving his right to appeal and that defendant made a valid waiver of his right to appeal, which forecloses review of his excessive sentence claim (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]).\nThe record discloses that upon accepting defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the court, in a lengthy plea allocution, and after explaining all the \u201ctrial rights\u201d defendant was waiving and ensuring he spoke to his attorney about the plea, and was satisfied with his legal help, then engaged in the following colloquy:\n\u201cTHE COURT: Now, in this case as part of the plea and sentence I promised you, you\u2019re being required to waive or give up your right to appeal this conviction.\n\u201cLet me explain to you what that means. This is a separate right. It is not a trial right. It\u2019s a separate right, the right to appeal.\n\u201cSo normally a defendant has the right to appeal a criminal conviction . . .\n\u201cAn appeal is a legal proceeding before another court. It\u2019s a higher court. It\u2019s not before me or Judge Ward, it\u2019s before an appeals court.\n\u201cOn the appeal a defendant, through his lawyer, can argue that some mistake was made in connection with his case, some error, something was wrong. You could also argue that the sentence was too much, too harsh and ask for a lower sentence if one was allowed by law . . .\n\u201cNow, normally even when a defendant pleads guilty he still has certain rights. With the guilty plea you don\u2019t give up all your rights normally.\n\u201cIn this case because of the sentence that I\u2019m promising you, you\u2019re being required to give up your right to appeal any aspect of this case in return for the plea and sentence I promised you.\n\u201cSo do you understand that explanation?\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\u201cTHE COURT: Are you willing to do that?\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d\nThis language exceeds the colloquy that provided for a valid waiver in People v Nicholson, one of the cases consolidated under People v Lopez (6 NY3d at 254-255). The trial court ensured that defendant understood that the right to appeal was separate from the \u201cpanoply of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty,\u201d and advised him that while he \u201cordinarily retains the right to an appeal even after pleading guilty, in this case he was being offered a particular plea by the prosecution on the condition that he give up that right\u201d (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 257; see also People v Rahman, 129 AD3d 553, 554 [1st Dept 2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015] [\u201cThe court discussed the waiver in detail and sufficiently ensured that defendant understood that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the other rights automatically forfeited by pleading guilty\u201d]). As was the case in Nicholson, it would have been better to secure a written waiver of the right to appeal. However, the record is sufficient to establish that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256, citing People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]).\nA defendant who has validly waived his right to appeal may not invoke this Court\u2019s interest-of-justice jurisdiction to reduce a bargained-for sentence (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255-256). \u201cBy pleading guilty and waiving the right to appeal, a defendant has forgone review of the terms of the plea, including harshness or excessiveness of the sentence\u201d (id. at 256).\nTo be sure, as the Court of Appeals clarified in Lopez, the Appellate Division may be divested of its unique interest-of-justice jurisdiction only by constitutional amendment (6 NY3d at 255, citing People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264, 267-268 [1986]). However, as Lopez went on to hold, \u201ca defendant is free to relinquish the right to invoke that authority and indeed does so by validly waiving the right to appeal\u201d (id.).\nIn People v Seaberg (74 NY2d 1 [1989]), the Court of Appeals further explained that \u201c[b]y pleading guilty a defendant forecloses the appellate court from reviewing the merits of the plea bargain in the interest of justice and there is nothing inherently wrong in a defendant similarly electing to foreclose review of a negotiated sentence\u201d (id. at 10). Stated another way,\n\u201ca bargained-for waiver of the right to appeal . . . does not operate to deprive the appellate court of its jurisdiction of the appeal. Instead, it merely forecloses appellate review of all claims that might be raised on appeal, except, of course, those categories of claims that survive such waivers under our case law\u201d (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 285 [1992]).\nFurther, as the majority in Lopez noted, as a practical matter the request to reduce a sentence as excessive is \u201cbrought to an appellate court\u2019s attention only when raised by defendants\u201d (6 NY3d at 256). Thus, while the Appellate Division may technically retain its interest-of-justice jurisdiction at all times, a defendant cannot \u201ceviscerate\u201d an agreement not to appeal a conviction and rely on the Court\u2019s inherent discretionary powers to reduce the sentence. Indeed, such a result would render a valid waiver of appeal meaningless and would be detrimental to the goals of \u201cfairness and finality in criminal matters!, which] are accomplished only insofar as the parties are confident that the \u2018carefully orchestrated bargain\u2019 of an agreed-upon sentence will not be disturbed as a discretionary matter\u201d (id. at 256, quoting People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d at 10).\nIn short, \u201c[h]aving received the benefit of his bargain, defendant should be bound by its terms\u201d (People v Lopez, 190 AD2d 545, 545 [1st Dept 1993]). This record provides no compelling evidence of special circumstances warranting the contrary.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (Roger S. Hayes, J.), rendered March 20, 2014, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, and sentencing him, as a second drug felony offender, to an aggregate term of IV2 to 3 years, should be affirmed.\nFriedman, Saxe and Kapnick, JJ., concur.\nJudgment, Supreme Court, New York County, rendered March 20, 2014, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's sentence following his guilty plea to charges of criminal sale of a controlled substance and possession of stolen property. The defendant's appeal, which argued that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid and that his sentence was excessive, was rejected, as the record showed he knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights. The court emphasized that a valid waiver precludes any review of the sentence under the interest-of-justice standard, reinforcing the importance of upholding plea agreements to ensure fairness and finality in criminal proceedings.<|eot_id|>"}

The plea was in satisfaction of that indictment and another which charged defendant with a similar sale which occurred while the first charge was pending. The plea bargain provided for a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years, unless defendant, in cooperation with the State Police, facilitated an A-II felony cocaine sale by a drug dealer to an undercover State Police investigator. In such event, the sentence would be 3 to 9 years. The sale had to occur within 30 days of the plea and be to the satisfaction of the prosecutor. Defendant was released with warnings that if he failed to return for his scheduled sentencing, the bargain as to the sentence would be off. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing, was thereafter apprehended and sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison.\nAfter defendant failed to appear for sentencing, defense counsel moved to have the Trial Judge recuse himself. Prior to defendant\u2019s plea, the Judge had contacted the State Police in an effort to confirm the status of a continuing defense counsel representation that defendant was working with the State Police. The claim was being used as a basis to delay the proceedings. Defendant contended that the contact prejudiced the Judge against him and that County Court erred in denying the recusal motion.\nWhere no legal ground for disqualification exists (see, Judiciary Law \u00a7 14), it is up to the conscience and discretion of the Trial Judge to determine if recusal is warranted under a given set of circumstances (see, People v Moreno, 70 NY2d 403). We find no abuse of County Court\u2019s discretion in refusing defendant\u2019s motion for recusal (see, People v Brunner, 182 AD2d 1123, lv denied 80 NY2d 828; People v Webb, 159 AD2d 289, lv denied 76 NY2d 744). The complained-of conduct was unrelated to the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt, occurred prior to the plea at which time the defense was fully aware of the contact and made no objection, and did not impact the sentence or the conditions to be completed to receive a reduced sentence. It must be noted that defendant did not move to withdraw his plea and does not seek such relief within this appeal.\nWe find no merit to defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. De fendant had an opportunity to explain the circumstances of his failure to appear, as well as his efforts to cooperate and meet the terms of his plea bargain. He failed to do so (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702). Defense counsel\u2019s conclusory explanation failed to raise an issue of fact requiring further inquiry. We find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances with defendant\u2019s sentencing, and decline to disturb the sentence imposed.\nCardona, P. J., White, Casey and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant convicted of third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance after pleading guilty. The plea agreement included a potential reduced sentence if the defendant cooperated with the State Police, but he failed to appear for sentencing and was subsequently sentenced to 4 to 12 years. The court denied the defendant's motion for the recusal of the Trial Judge, finding no prejudice or abuse of discretion, and affirmed the judgment, noting the absence of legal grounds to withdraw the plea or contest the sentencing.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant\u2019s primary claim on this appeal is that his plea of guilty to the above enumerated charges was induced by promises concerning his sentence which were not honored.

Defendant\u2019s only contention on appeal is that this sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Not only did defendant receive the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [d]; [4] [b]), but he pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court.

He pleaded guilty to the first count of an indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and a superior court information charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of all charges. He also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years, to run consecutive to a sentence imposed in connection with a prior felony conviction. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Lambe, 282 AD2d 776, 777; People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 832, lv denied 95 NY2d 966). Despite defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution, his factual recitation does not negate an essential element of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty so as to constitute an exception to the preservation requirement (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636). Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits, the record discloses that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. County Court gave defendant a detailed explanation of the rights he would be relinquishing by pleading guilty and defendant indicated that he understood them, was not coerced or threatened into pleading guilty and was satisfied with his attorney. County Court proceeded to question defendant regarding the specifics of each crime and, in our view, defendant\u2019s responses adequately established the factual elements of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty (see, People v Kemp, supra at 636; People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806, 807, lv denied 97 NY2d 686).\nFurthermore, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Given that defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and was on parole for a prior drug-related felony conviction at the time of the instant charges, we perceive no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see, People v Lambe, supra at 777; People v Hines, 277 AD2d 504, 505, lv denied 96 NY2d 759).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

In full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a waiver of his right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to two concurrent terms of 3V2 to IOV2 years in prison. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his argument that the plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is not preserved for our review (see, People v Jones, 289 AD2d 871; People v Negron, 280 AD2d 780, lv denied 96 NY2d 832). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant\u2019s claim, we would find it to be without merit. The transcript of the plea proceedings reveals that County Court fully informed defendant of the ramifications of pleading guilty and defendant indicated that he understood them, was not coerced into entering a plea and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Defendant gave a factual recitation which sufficiently supported his plea of guilty to the crimes charged. When defendant was given an opportunity to withdraw his plea at sentencing, he chose not to do so. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Fennell, 284 AD2d 795; People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, lv denied 95 NY2d 966).\nMoreover, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is encompassed by his voluntary waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733; People v Bolden, 287 AD2d 883, lv denied 97 NY2d 654; People v Negron, supra at 781). In any event, we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion which would warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Jones, supra at 730; People v Robertson, 288 AD2d 620, lv denied 97 NY2d 760).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

As part of the plea agreement, County Court informed defendant of his maximum sentence exposure as a predicate felon and agreed not to impose a sentence greater than 3Vs years in prison followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. At that time, the court informed defendant before releasing him pending sentencing that, if he were arrested for any reason prior to the sentencing date, the court would no longer be bound by the sentencing commitment. Thereafter, while released awaiting sentencing, defendant was arrested on new felony drug charges in Warren County. The court ultimately found that defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an enhanced prison term of SVa years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This appeal followed.\nInitially, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s claim that County Court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into defendant\u2019s post-plea arrest before imposing an enhanced sentence. Our review confirms that the court made an inquiry of sufficient depth so as to \u201cbe satisfied \u2014 not of defendant\u2019s guilt of the new criminal charge[s] but of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest on th[ose] charge[s]\u201d (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; see People v Purcelle, 107 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2013]). Here, after defendant was initially questioned regarding the new arrest, he denied involvement and the court promptly ordered an adjournment in order to find out if this was a \u201cviable arrest\u201d in violation of the plea agreement. At defendant\u2019s subsequent appearance, the court was in receipt of a May 2011 nine-count indictment charging defendant with numerous crimes, including criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant\u2019s counsel then relayed that defendant entered a \u201cnot guilty plea\u201d to the new charges, but also admitted that defendant\u2019s undisputed \u201carrest alone would be a violation of the plea agreement\u201d and requested leniency as to the sentence. When ask to respond, defendant stated that he agreed with his counsel\u2019s statements. Although defendant maintains that a more formal Outley hearing should have been directed, this claim is unpreserved due to his failure on this record \u201cto seek such a hearing or otherwise move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction\u201d (People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]). In any event, it is apparent from the record that the court \u201cimposed the enhanced sentence only after it was sufficiently assured that the information upon which it based the sentence was reliable and accurate\u201d (People v French, 72 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]).\nLastly, defendant maintains that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive under the circumstances. We disagree. Given defendant\u2019s demonstrated disregard of the no-arrest restriction in the plea agreement, coupled with his criminal history and \u201cthe fact that the enhanced sentence was less than the statutory maximum, we find no extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice\u201d (People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]; see People v Clapper, 87 AD3d 1227, 1227-1228 [2011] ; People v White, 24 AD3d 817, 817 [2005]; see also Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i]).\nLahtinen, J.P, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after he pleaded guilty. Despite the plea agreement limiting his sentence to 3.5 years, the defendant was sentenced to 5.5 years after being arrested on new felony drug charges while awaiting sentencing, which violated the plea terms. The court found that it conducted a sufficient inquiry into the arrest and ruled that the enhanced sentence was appropriate given the defendant\u2019s disregard for the plea conditions and his criminal history.<|eot_id|>"}

He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each crime, the longest of which was 3 to 15 years. Defendant asserts that because he has a drug problem and this is his first felony conviction, the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. The record reveals that defendant continued to engage in drug-related activities even after his first arrest and, further, that defendant rejected an offer made by the prosecution of less substantial sentences. As a consequence, defendant pleaded guilty without having negotiated a specific sentence in connection with his plea.

On appeal, defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his guilt, he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and his sentence was harsh and excessive.\nThe record reveals that defendant made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; see also, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273). In any event, by entering such a guilty plea defendant forfeited any argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the plea (see, People v Dunbar, 53 NY2d 868; People v Thomas, 53 NY2d 338; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026). Nor are we inclined to reverse in the interest of justice given defendant\u2019s admission of guilt and express rejection during his plea colloquy of the agency defense now asserted on appeal. Further, were we to consider the issue we would find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court given defendant\u2019s criminal record and the fact that he agreed to the sentence imposed, which was not the harshest possible, as a part of a negotiated plea that allowed him to plead guilty to one count in satisfaction of a four-count indictment (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Finally, we cannot conclude on the record before us that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and, to the extent that defendant\u2019s claims rely upon material outside the record, they are not reviewable on this direct appeal (see, People v Pelaccio, 159 AD2d 734, lv denied 76 NY2d 793).\nWeiss, P.

J.\nAppeal by the defendant from a judgment of conviction of the County Court of Chemung County upon a jury verdict of guilty of selling a dangerous drug in the second degree and imposing sentence for not less than 4 years and not more than 12 years. The appellant contends that the retained trial counsel was so ineffective as an advocate that in effect the proceedings were a mockery of justice. (See People v. Smith, 31 A D 2d 847.) However, the fact that certain objections might have been made and thereby put opposing counsel to further efforts does not establish ineffectiveness. The record establishes that the defense counsel at trial was aware of those matters which the People had to establish and effectively attempted to cast doubt upon the People\u2019s proof. The experience of the members of the State Police who testified was sufficiently explored upon the record to permit them to express their opinion that the substance received from defendant \u201cappeared to be marijuana\u201d. The qualifications of the chemists were also sufficiently explored and their identification of the substance as marijuana obviated any reliance by the jury upon the opinion of the police officers as to what the substance \u201c appeared \u201d to be. The court, upon sentencing, specified that the defendant had been convicted of three separate criminal acts and it is obvious that the court, while feeling that justice did not require consecutive sentences, did feel that justice required a minimum sentence. Accordingly, the reference of the court to setting a minimum sentence because it was not imposing consecutive sentences is a sufficient expression of reason to comply with section 70.00 (subd. 3, par. [b]) of the Penal Law. Furthermore, the term of imprisonment does not appear to be excessive. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

County Court specifically advised defendant that if he intentionally failed to appear at sentencing on the scheduled date, he could be sentenced in absentia to a term of imprisonment of lV\u00e1 to 4 years. Defendant was asked if he agreed to such an arrangement as a condition of the plea bargain and he answered in the affirmative. Defendant appeared for sentencing on August 17, 1988 and requested an adjournment until September 12, 1988. The court granted the request, but again stated that defendant\u2019s failure to appear on the scheduled date could result in a sentence of imprisonment.\nDefendant failed to appear for sentencing on September 12, 1988 and his attorney requested a two-day adjournment, explaining that defendant had recently been involved in an automobile accident and was having minor difficulty obtaining sufficient cash for the fine. On September 14, 1988, defendant\u2019s counsel appeared without defendant and again asked for a two-day adjournment, with a similar explanation. When defendant failed to appear on September 16, 1988, the court denied his attorney\u2019s request for another adjournment and sentenced defendant in absentia to a prison term of lVs to 4 years. Defendant\u2019s bail was revoked and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued.\nDefendant was arrested and brought before the court on March 13, 1989. When questioned as to the reason for his failure to appear for sentencing as scheduled, defendant explained that he had been unable to obtain sufficient cash to pay the fine and was fearful that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. County Court refused to reconsider the previously imposed sentence.\nDefendant claims on appeal that County Court erred in sentencing him in absentia, but there is ample evidence in the record that defendant\u2019s failure to appear was deliberate and, therefore, he waived his right to be present (see, People v Sanchez, 65 NY2d 436). Defendant was fully advised of the consequences of his failure to appear and he agreed to sentencing in absentia if his failure to appear was intentional. He was given several opportunities to appear or provide an adequate excuse for his absence. He did neither. The court made a sufficient inquiry into the surrounding circumstances to determine that defendant\u2019s failure to appear was deliberate, and the court was justified in refusing to grant another adjournment.\nDefendant has filed a pro se letter proclaiming his innocence, but such a claim was forfeited by his guilty plea. The judgment should be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P.

The first indictment, No. 136-89, was against defendant alone; the second, No. 134-89, was against defendant and another and proceeded upon an acting in concert or accomplice theory. Following a jury trial on the first indictment, defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On the day sentencing was scheduled to occur relative to that conviction, defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges contained in the second indictment. As part of his plea agreement, defendant expressly waived his rights to appeal from the convictions arising from both indictments. He subsequently was sentenced on both convictions to concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 6 to 18 years. Claiming errors in the denial of certain pretrial motions in connection with both indictments, alleged proof defects in the trial of the first indictment and asserting that the sentences imposed were excessive, defendant now appeals.\nIn our view, defendant\u2019s express waiver of the right to appeal both judgments of conviction is valid and enforceable and precludes our consideration of most of the arguments advanced. It is now well settled that a defendant ordinarily may waive his or her right to appeal as part of a negotiated plea as long as the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1). While the waiver in this case is slightly different from most in that defendant waived appellate review not only of the guilty plea conviction but also of his prior jury trial conviction, in view of the announced lack of \u201caffirmative public policy to be served in fostering appeals or prohibiting their waiver\u201d (People v Seaberg, supra, at 8) combined with the strong public policy of encouraging \u201ca prompt resolution of criminal proceedings with all the benefits that enure from final disposition\u201d (supra, at 7), we see nothing offensive, constitutionally, statutorily or policywise, in permitting a defendant to waive rights to appeal in more than one conviction as part of a negotiated plea in situations such as this where the criminal proceedings are so closely connected.\nNor is there any merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the waiver of his rights to appeal were not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made or that the waiver was unreasonable or inappropriate under the circumstances. Defendant was 29 years old at the time of the plea, articulate and no stranger to the criminal justice system. A review of the record reveals that County Court informed defendant twice that one of the consequences of his plea would be waiver of his right to appeal both the guilty plea conviction and the jury trial conviction, stating at one point prior to taking the plea, \"Of course you realize that this will be a final sentence in terms of your waiving your right to appeal? You will not be able to appeal the judgments of this court in connection with both Indictment 134-89 and 136-89.\u201d When asked if he understood these terms, defendant responded, \"Yeah\u201d, and the following colloquy ensued:\n\"the court: So is everything out in the open?\n\"defendant: Uh-hum.\n\"the court: Uh-hum means yes?\n\"defendant: Yes.\n\"the court: No hidden or secret agreements?\n\"defendant: Nope.\u201d\nMoreover, upon review, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s relinquishment of his rights to appeal both convictions was neither unfair nor oppressive. Significantly, there is absolutely no hint that defining the scope of the right to appeal waiver to include the prior jury trial conviction was designed to conceal error or misconduct which occurred during that trial. This is confirmed by our review of the trial transcript. Rather, it is apparent from a reading of defendant\u2019s comments during the pre-plea discussion that the plea was the direct result of defendant\u2019s knowledge that the same evidence used against him in the trial on the first indictment would be used in the trial on the second and his desire to minimize his jail time by obtaining concurrent sentences.\nFinally, while cognizant that certain appellate arguments can be reviewed despite the existence of an enforceable, bargained-for waiver of the right to appeal (see, e.g., People v Callahan, supra; People v Seaberg, supra; cf., People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026), defendant\u2019s arguments regarding whether certain of the jury\u2019s findings accorded with the weight of the evidence and whether the court abused its discretion in imposing the sentences do not fall within that category (see, People v Callahan, supra; People v Baker, 195 AD2d 700). While it is not clear from a reading of the record whether defendant was informed that waiver of the right to appeal included pretrial proceedings (compare, People v Darling, 183 AD2d 950, lv denied 80 NY2d 902), we have reviewed defendant\u2019s contentions in this regard (namely, that denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss both indictments for failure to comply with CPL 190.50 [5] [a] was erroneous as was denial of his motion for sanctions for the prosecution\u2019s alleged nondisclosure), and find them to be without merit.\nMikoll, J. P., Mercure, Cardona and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgments of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, despite his appeal claiming errors in pretrial motions and excessive sentencing. The defendant had waived his right to appeal both convictions as part of a negotiated plea, which the court found to be valid, knowing, and voluntary. The ruling emphasized that the waiver did not undermine any public policy and that the defendant's arguments on appeal lacked merit.<|eot_id|>"}

The People recommended that defendant, a second felony offender, be sentenced to a prison term of six years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court ultimately imposed the recommended sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel but, as he concedes, he did not preserve that issue by way of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Kerwin, 117 AD3d 1097, 1097-1098 [2014]). In any case, defense counsel entered into a stipulation in lieu of motions that provided for discovery and various pretrial hearings, and there is no indication that proceeding by that route affected defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty (see People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1200-1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013]). Defense counsel went on to negotiate a plea agreement that significantly limited defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure, and defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he had adequately discussed the terms of that agreement with counsel and was satisfied with counsel\u2019s performance. Accordingly, were this issue preserved, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d 1080, 1081-1082 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 961 [2014]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1344 [2011]). Finally, to the extent that defendant contends that counsel failed to adequately meet with him prior to the plea colloquy, this claim implicates matters outside of the record and, as such, is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1271 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]).\nPeters, PJ., Stein, Rose and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Appellate Division affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea.

That hearing has been held, and County Court has found that defendant failed to overcome the burden of proving that this conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and resentenced him as a second felony offender. The original sentence, an indeterminate term of 31/2 to 7 years\u2019 incarceration, was allowed to stand and defendant appeals. We affirm.\nThe applicable criminal procedure law (CPL 400.21 [7] [b]), and controlling precedent (People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9), squarely place the burden \"upon the defendant to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim that [his] conviction was unconstitutionally obtained\u201d (supra, at 15; see, People v Robare, 226 AD2d 837, 838). Defendant has simply failed to carry his burden. Nothing in the remittal hearing transcript manifests that defendant\u2019s 1982 guilty plea was other than knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. When asked specific questions regarding that plea allocution, defendant professed neither to know nor remember what occurred at that time. As for the purportedly supportive testimony of defendant\u2019s brother, who pleaded guilty in 1982 together with defendant, it adds not one iota to defendant\u2019s claim. Furthermore, the transcript of the plea proceeding, though seemingly essential to defendant\u2019s case, is lacking from his proof on the issue.\nAnd, although defendant suggests otherwise, we are of the view that County Court\u2019s decision complied with the statutory mandate that it \"make a finding as to whether or not the defendant has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction\u201d (CPL 400.21 [7] [c]), and further that no extraordinary circumstances exist warranting the disturbance of the court\u2019s sentence (see, People v Simoens, 159 AD2d 818, 820, lv denied 76 NY2d 743; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nMikoll, J.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was thereafter sentenced to a term of three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s claims that his plea was not entered knowingly, voluntarily or intelligently and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are not preserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]; People v Dantzler, 63 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 799 [2010]). Moreover, with regard to the plea, the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that cast doubt on his guilt or tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251 [2009]). In any event, defendant\u2019s claims are without merit, as the record reveals that County Court fully apprised defendant of the ramifications of pleading guilty and defendant communicated his understanding on the record, relinquished his rights and freely admitted his guilt (see People v Swarts, 64 AD3d 801, 802 [2009]). Further, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, it was not necessary that defendant recite the facts underlying his crime (see People v Smith, 57 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2008]).\nAs to defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, his claims that counsel failed to meet with him, make certain pretrial motions, investigate certain defenses and pressured him into pleading guilty concern matters outside the record and are not properly the subject of a direct appeal (see People v Carroll, 299 AD2d 572, 572-573 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 626 [2003]). Finally, as the record reflects that defendant did not validly waive his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]), we have considered defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his agreed-upon prison sentence and find neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see People v Parsons, 65 AD3d 716, 716 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 838 [2009]).\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

Defendant was indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree in violation of section 220.35 of the Penal Law. Subsequently, he pied guilty to the indictment and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 4% years. He contends on this appeal that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to sentence him to prison instead of committing him to the care of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. He also maintains that section 208 (subd. 4, par. b) of the Mental Hygiene Law in granting the court discretion either to impose a jail sentence, or to certify for Narcotic Addiction Control Commission care for rehabilitation, is cruel and inhuman punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. (See People v. Davis, 33 N Y 2d 221.) Both contentions lack merit. The court was fully aware of defendant\u2019s drug addiction problem, and the fact that he previously had received treatment. The court, in its discretion, elected to impose a jail sentence. This it was authorized to do pursuant to section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. {People v. Garter, 31 N Y 2d 964.) The statute, in our opinion, presents no constitutional defect. It properly grants discretion to the court to provide medical treatment to felons who it feels will benefit thereby, or to impose jail sentences where the interests of justice will be better served. {Smith v. Follette, 445 F. 2d 955.) The judgment should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

The court found that the sentencing was within the court\u2019s discretion and upheld the judgment, stating that the law allows for either jail sentences or rehabilitation based on what serves justice best.<|eot_id|>"}

After he rejected a plea offer and proceeded to a jury trial, he was found guilty as charged. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of 12 years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal\u2014that the imposed sentence was in retaliation for exercising his constitutional right to a jury trial\u2014may well be unpreserved for our review given the arguable failure of defendant or his counsel to raise the issue at sentencing (see People v Hurley, 75 NY2d 887, 888 [1990]; People v Haskins, 121 AD3d 1181, 1185 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1120 [2015]; People v Gallup, 302 AD2d 681, 686 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 594 [2003]). In any event, the fact that the imposed sentence was longer than the one offered defendant during the plea negotiations \u201c 4s not proof that defendant was penalized for exercising his right to a jury trial\u2019 \u201d (People v Young, 86 AD3d 796, 800 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 905 [2011], quoting People v Robinson, 72 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]; see People v McCray, 96 AD3d 1160, 1161 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1104 [2012]). While defendant was considering a plea offer tendered by the People, County Court advised defendant of his potential sentencing exposure should he be convicted as charged following a jury trial. The court further stressed that it had no interest in penalizing defendant for proceeding to trial, but advised him that the light sentence offer reflected his willingness to enter a guilty plea to a reduced charge that would have protected a confidential informant whose identity had not yet been disclosed. Defendant nevertheless rebuffed that and all other efforts to resolve the charges and proceeded to a trial where the informant testified, and the extent of defendant\u2019s involvement in the drug trade was made apparent. \u201c[T]he quid pro quo of the bargaining process will almost necessarily involve offers to moderate sentences that ordinarily would be greater,\u201d and the record before us reveals no evidence of retaliation or vindictiveness on the part of County Court stemming from defendant\u2019s refusal to accept a plea bargain (People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 412 [1980], cert denied 449 US 1087 [1981]; see People v Martinez, 26 NY3d 196, 200 [2015]; People v Molina, 73 AD3d 1292, 1293 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 807 [2010]; People v Pepper, 89 AD2d 714, 718 [1982], affd 59 NY2d 353 [1983]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Garry, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the defendant's conviction for two counts each of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, following a jury trial. The defendant argued that his sentence was retaliatory for exercising his right to a jury trial, but the court found this claim likely unpreserved for review and noted no evidence of vindictiveness in the sentencing process. The court emphasized that longer sentences following a trial compared to plea offers are common and do not inherently indicate punishment for choosing to go to trial.<|eot_id|>"}

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered March 24, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and the plea agreement included the waiver of the right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a prior felony offender, to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was valid. County Court explained that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea and confirmed that defendant understood the ramifications of the waiver. Defendant thereafter executed a counseled written waiver in open court. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1195-1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Koumjian, 101 AD3d 1175, 1175 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1100 [2013]). Therefore, defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded from our review (see People v Miller, 137 AD3d 1485, 1485 [2016]; People v Crispell, 136 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1149 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Egan Jr., Lynch and Rose, JJ., concur.

Defendant\u2019s only contention on appeal is that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced because he has no prior convictions and his codefendant\u2019s sentence is more lenient. First, not only is there no requirement that the sentencing court give each codefendant the same sentence (see, People v Powers, 173 AD2d 886, 890), but here a more lenient sentence was warranted as the codefendant pleaded guilty to three class B felonies while defendant pleaded guilty to a class A-II felony. In addition, in exchange for defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, one count of the indictment was dismissed and the District Attorney agreed to recommend the prison sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that defendant\u2019s sentence, which was less than the harshest authorized by statute (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]), is harsh and excessive (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715).\nMahoney, P.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered October 11, 1995, upon defendant\u2019s plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nPursuant to a negotiated plea and sentencing agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to two concurrent terms of imprisonment having a minimum of 3\u00bd and a maximum of 7 years with the alternative of enrolling in and successfully completing a 90-day drug rehabilitation program at Willard Bay Drug Treatment Facility, in which case the balance of her sentence would be served on parole. For reasons which do not appear in the record, defendant did not complete the Willard program and is thus serving the original sentence imposed.\nDefendant contends on this appeal that her plea agreement was involuntary in that when it was made she lacked sufficient information and understanding of the nature of the drug treatment program to make an informed acceptance of the plea and sentencing options. She further contends that the People breached their agreement to afford her the opportunity to complete an appropriate drug treatment program and that her sentence was otherwise harsh and excessive.\nDefendant\u2019s arguments are premised on facts and events not contained in the record, which concludes with the sentencing on October 11, 1995. Whether she entered the program or why she failed to complete it is not a matter of record. We cannot review that which is not before us or speculate on matters as to which there is no proof. Defendant\u2019s contentions, with the requisite supporting material, would properly be the subject of a CPL article 440 motion. Nor can we say that defendant\u2019s sentence is harsh or excessive, given the original charges. The terms of the sentence were clearly set forth on the record at the time of the plea and at sentencing, and defendant acknowledged that she was satisfied with same.\nMercure, Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County, which sentenced the defendant to two concurrent prison terms after her guilty plea for drug-related crimes. The defendant argued that her plea was involuntary and that the prosecution breached the plea agreement regarding drug rehabilitation, but the court found her claims unsupported by the record and noted that any related evidence should be presented in a separate motion. The court concluded that the sentence was not harsh or excessive given the circumstances.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), rendered June 29, 2011, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (seven counts), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and a new trial is ordered.\nDuring pretrial proceedings, the defendant unsuccessfully moved to relieve his counsel. Shortly thereafter, at the outset of a pretrial hearing pursuant to People v Rodriguez (79 NY2d 445 [1992]), the defendant made his first of three timely applications to proceed pro se. As he did so, he referred to the recent denial of his motion to relieve his counsel, and the County Court made clear that his counsel would be his \u201clast attorney.\u201d When the court asked the defendant why he wanted to represent himself, he explained that his counsel failed to challenge a search warrant and failed to take up a \u201cnumber of issues\u201d that the defendant wanted to raise. At that point, defense counsel went on record stating that, in his view, there was no good faith basis upon which to challenge the search warrant, the legal arguments raised by the defendant were not relevant, and his client was like a \u201cbroken record\u201d and was asking him \u201cto do certain things that [he didn\u2019t] agree with.\u201d The court then asked the defendant questions to determine whether he was knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to counsel and whether his request to proceed pro se was unequivocal. The court also questioned the defendant about his level of education and tested his knowledge of the law. Although the defendant\u2019s desire to represent himself was unequivocal, the court denied his application, in part because the defendant was admittedly not prepared to proceed that day with the Rodriguez hearing. The court also made clear, however, that the defendant could renew his application prior to trial.\nFour months later, before a different Judge and at the outset of a pretrial hearing pursuant to People v Sandoval (34 NY2d 371 [1974]), defense counsel moved to be relieved. The motion was denied. The defendant then renewed his application to proceed pro se. The County Court summarily denied the application, relying on the questioning of the defendant by the prior Judge. At that point, defense counsel explained that he and the defendant were \u201cvery much at odds over the strategy\u201d and indicated that he \u201c[did] not want to act as an agent for [the defendant\u2019s] witness tampering.\u201d When the defendant vigorously objected to his own counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cwitness tampering,\u201d defense counsel told him to \u201cshut [his] mouth for a minute\u201d and implored the court to let the defendant represent himself, adding that he should not \u201cbe held here prisoner for this garbage.\u201d The court refused to either relieve defense counsel or allow the defendant to proceed pro se.\nFinally, just before the start of jury selection, defense counsel once again, renewed the defendant\u2019s application to represent himself. The County Court reiterated that it was relying on the prior Judge\u2019s searching inquiry and conclusion that the defend ant was unable to represent himself, which the court had \u201cno reason to upset.\u201d\n\u201cA defendant in a criminal case may invoke the right to defend pro se provided: (1) the request is unequivocal and timely asserted, (2) there has been a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, and (3) the defendant has not engaged in conduct which would prevent the fair and orderly exposition of the issues\u201d (People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d 10, 17 [1974]; see People v Smith, 68 NY2d 737, 738 [1986]).\nHere, the defendant made three timely applications to proceed pro se. Contrary to the People\u2019s contention, the fact that these applications were accompanied by unsuccessful requests for new counsel did not, under the circumstances, render the applications equivocal (see People v Malone, 119 AD3d 1352, 1354 [2014]; People v Lewis, 114 AD3d 402, 404 [2014]; cf. People v Gillian, 8 NY3d 85 [2006]). Rather, the defendant\u2019s repetitious, explicit reassertions of his right at every opportunity served to dispel any possible misunderstanding of his intentions or of his sincerity in desiring to represent himself (see People v Davis, 49 NY2d 114, 119 [1979]).\nAs to the second requirement that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel be knowing and intelligent, the record shows that the County Court\u2019s precautionary inquiry and warnings to the defendant regarding the perils of representing himself and the value of legal representation were sufficient to impress upon him the dangers and disadvantages of giving up the fundamental right to counsel (see Faretta v California, 422 US 806, 835 [1975]; People v White, 56 NY2d 110, 117 [1982]; People v Powe, 234 AD2d 397, 397 [1996]).\nTo the extent that the County Court based its denial of the defendant\u2019s application on the ground that he had a history of mental illness, this was error. \u201cNew York courts can, in appropriate circumstances, deny a self-representation request if a severely-mentally-ill defendant who is competent to stand trial otherwise lacks the mental capacity to waive counsel and proceed pro se\u201d (People v Stone, 22 NY3d 520, 527 [2014]). This is not such a case. While the defendant acknowledged prior hospitalizations for mental illness, there is no indication in the record that the defendant was severely mentally ill at the time he made his requests to proceed pro se, or that any mental condition at that time rendered him incapable of intelligently and voluntarily waiving his right to counsel and representing himself.\nTo the extent that the County Court based its denial of the defendant\u2019s application on his failure to correctly answer the prior Judge\u2019s questions about certain legal terms, the Court of Appeals has pointed out that \u201c [t] o accept a defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge of legal principles and rules of law or his unfamiliarity with courtroom procedures as the ground for concluding that he is not qualified to represent himself would in effect be to eviscerate the constitutional right of self-representation; such limitations could confidently be said to exist in nearly every criminal case in which the defendant had not received legal training\u201d (People v Davis, 49 NY2d at 120; see People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d at 17-18). In fact, the defendant informed the court that he had represented himself twice before in civil matters, attended a legal research class provided by the Department of Corrections, worked in a prison law library, and obtained a certificate in legal research and basic law library management. Under such circumstances, \u201c[t]he inference may be drawn that the trial court \u2014 unquestionably in furtherance of what it perceived to be defendant\u2019s best interests \u2014 was determined to deny defendant\u2019s applications no matter what he said or what the record otherwise showed\u201d (People v Davis, 49 NY2d at 120).\nWith regard to the third and final prong of the McIntyre test, there is no indication in the record that the defendant\u2019s overall conduct was disruptive, obstreperous, or \u201ccalculated to undermine, upset or unreasonably delay the progress of the trial\u201d (People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d at 18; see People v Schoolfield, 196 AD2d 111, 117 [1994]).\nWhat is perhaps most troubling about this record is that the County Court would neither agree to relieve defense counsel, even after he took positions that were plainly adverse to his client (see People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 966 [2013]), nor permit the defendant to proceed pro se, despite his timely and unequivocal requests to do so. This placed the defendant in an untenable position.\nSince the denial of the right of self-representation is not subject to harmless error analysis (see People v LaValle, 3 NY3d 88, 106 [2004]), the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered (see People v Forney, 303 AD2d 763 [2003]; People v Tejada, 289 AD2d 516 [2001]).\nWe note that the People correctly concede on appeal that the terms of the defendant\u2019s postrelease supervision were illegal. The range of postrelease supervision permitted upon conviction, as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction, is IV2 to 3 years (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]; [4] [b] [i]; 70.45 [2] [d]), whereas here, the County Court imposed terms of five years.\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se supplemental brief, are without merit.\nChambers, J.P., Hall, Austin and LaSalle, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant's appeal from a judgment convicting him on multiple counts related to drug offenses was granted, resulting in a reversal of the judgment and an order for a new trial. The County Court had improperly denied the defendant's repeated and unequivocal requests to represent himself, despite evidence that he had the capacity to waive counsel and no disruptive behavior during proceedings. Additionally, the terms of his postrelease supervision were found to be illegal, as they exceeded the permissible duration for his classification as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction.<|eot_id|>"}

Given defendant\u2019s criminal background and the fact that he was on parole for a drug-related crime at the time of the instant offense, we are unpersuaded by his contention that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive. Furthermore, even if preserved for our review (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]), we would reject defendant\u2019s pro se assertion that he was denied meaningful representation by his counsel\u2019s failure to properly investigate or pursue any pretrial motions in light of the favorable plea agreement and absence of any indication in the record that defense counsel was ineffective (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Ward, 2 AD3d 1219 [2003]).

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered January 28, 1974, upon verdicts convicting defendant of two counts of criminally selling a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of subdivision 1 of section 220.39 of the Penal Law and sentencing him to two consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment of seven years to life. On this appeal, the defendant makes numerous arguments, two of which have been previously rejected by this court. Thus, his challenge to the constitutionality of section 70.00 of the Penal Law, pursuant to which he was sentenced, has been found wanting (People v. Venable, 46 A D 2d 73), as has his complaint that the trial court should have directed the prosecution to produce police informant, Daniel Jerome Powell, as a witness (People v. Fowler, 46 A D 2d 838; People v. Hood, 46 A D 2d 837). His remaining contentions are also without merit. The court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance to allow the defendant to produce Powell as a witness was within its discretionary power (People v. Torre, 33 A D 2d 43) which was properly exercised here where there was no showing that the defendant would be able to- produce Powell or that his testimony would exculpate the defendant' as claimed. Likewise, the chain of evidence with regard to the possession of the narcotics by the police was adequately established (ef. People v. Connelly, 35 N Y 2d 171), and the imposition of consecutive sentences was within the competence of the court (ef. People v. Thiel, 25 N Y 2d 926). As to the cross-examination of Trooper James Werthmuller and Investigator Michael Elliot, there was no showing that the limitations placed thereon by the trial court prejudiced the defendant. Finally, the defendant\u2019s former status as a police informant, to which the prosecutor alluded in his summation when questioning whether the defendant was worthy of belief, was brought out on direct examination by the defendant\u2019s own attorney who made no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at trial. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

Following a competency hearing, County Court found him unfit to stand trial and committed him to a psychiatric facility. After several months of treatment, defendant was determined to be in partial remission and competent to stand trial. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced, as a second felony offender, to consecutive prison terms of 5 to 10 years for each of the criminal sale counts, consecutive prison terms of 5 to 10 years for each of the criminal possession counts, to run concurrent with the sale counts, and a concurrent one-year jail term for the child endangerment conviction.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on this appeal is that his sentence is harsh and excessive given the evidence of his ongoing mental illness. Nevertheless, defendant was found competent to stand trial (see People v Rodney, 245 AD2d 394, 395 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 929 [1998]) and, in light of his extensive criminal history and the nature of the subject crimes, we see no abuse of County Court\u2019s sentencing discretion nor extraordinary circumstancing warranting modification in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]; People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 917 [2000]; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 872 [1999]; see also CPL 470.15 [6] [b]).\nMercure, Peters, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.
