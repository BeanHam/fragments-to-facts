It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \nDoctor: Okay. \nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \nDoctor: Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life? \nPatient: No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain.  He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

That sounds right. \nDoctor: Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results. \nPatient: Okey. They should be in my chart. I had Doctor Lin send over all my records. \nDoctor: Here it is. It says that the right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on December eighteenth, two thousand and three.  \nPatient: Whatever that means? I ended up getting a nerve block because I was still in pain.

She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.

Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \nDoctor: Was she slurring?\nGuest_family: Nope. \nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \nDoctor: How was it after that? \nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.<|eot_id|>"}

You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region. \nPatient: What are we going to do about this? \nDoctor: Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?\nPatient: No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall. \nDoctor: Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. \nPatient: Why is that?\nDoctor: There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death. \nPatient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?\nDoctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean. \nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia.\nPatient: Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Welcome to the clinic, Miss A. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: Let's start with your medical history. What medical conditions do you have? \nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}

Could you say ah for me? \nPatient: Ah. \nDoctor: It looks like your tongue isn't swollen either. \nPatient: That's good to hear. \nDoctor: Have you been feeling a shortness of breath, wheezing, or other related symptoms?\nPatient: Not that I know of. \nDoctor: Sounds good. I wonder why this happened. Did you do anything the night before? \nPatient: Uh. A few days ago, I was working and had to remove some insulation. Other than that, I don't know what else could have given me these rashes. \nDoctor: I see. Do you remember being itchy after that? Did you try any new foods? \nPatient: Nope I was not itchy.

It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|eot_id|>"}

How are you doing so far with Lamictal? \nPatient: Yes, it's the follow up. Lamictal was okay. There was no side effect with that. But I had twitching in my muscles a lot of times. It was not generalized, but I was very afraid that this will happen. \nDoctor: What time of day was it?

Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. \nDoctor: What eyelid was drooping? \nPatient: I don't remember? \nDoctor: What is your dominate hand? \nPatient: I am right handed. \nDoctor: And how old are you? \nPatient: I am sixty seven. \nDoctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?\nPatient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.<|eot_id|>"}

What brings you to the emergency room? \nPatient: I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \nDoctor: Which side left or right?\nPatient: I think its left. \nDoctor: For how long?\nPatient: I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too. \nDoctor: Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: What about your bowel movements?\nPatient: Nope everything is as usual. \nDoctor: Any change in urinary habits?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: Any changes in your skin? Any rash? Any kind of eyesight issue?\nPatient: Nope, no changes.\nDoctor: What about pain? Like headache or any joint pain? \nPatient: Nope, no pain anywhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 47-year-old Latin American man presented to the emergency room after being told to come in for a high potassium value drawn the previous day. He had gone to an outside clinic the day prior to presentation complaining of weakness and fatigue. Labs drawn there revealed a potassium of 7.0 and he was told to come here for further evaluation. At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.<|eot_id|>"}

The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. \nGuest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this?

These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nErosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use.

She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.   I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.<|eot_id|>"}

One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months.

The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.\nDoctor: How old are you, miss?\nPatient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. \nDoctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?\nPatient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.

Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.\nDoctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.\nDoctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?\nPatient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.\nDoctor: What work you do?\nPatient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.

The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.<|eot_id|>"}

I was so lightheaded that I had to pull over. \nDoctor: How long did the episode last? \nPatient: About two to three minutes. \nDoctor: Is this the only time that this has happened? \nPatient: No. In November last year, I was in the middle of eating breakfast when I got dizzy. I was so dizzy that I was nauseous, and I threw up several times. I was so exhausted from the dizziness and throwing up that I went to my room and took a two hour nap. I felt better and back to normal after I woke up from my nap. \nDoctor: How long did the vertigo last? \nPatient: It lasted about two to three minutes.

Have you been taking anything for the pain? I remember you were having problems with your lower back the last time you were here. Did you get a chance to see the orthopedist? I believe the left shoulder pain could be due to impingement syndrome. \nPatient: No, I haven't taken anything for it yet and I forgot to make an appointment with the doc you recommended. I've been smoking cigs to help with the pain. \nDoctor: I'd advise that you try to wean off smoking for now and consider looking into nicotine patches. Let me see what I can do for the pain and if we can schedule you to see an orthopedist. \nPatient: Thanks, doc. I've had a lot of trouble weaning off cigs for a while now.

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.

These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.

In discussing with me directly, patient primarily expresses that he would like to have his erections last longer.  However, looking at the quiz as he filled it out, he reported that much less than half the time was he able to get erections during sexual activity and only about half of the time he was able to maintain his erection after penetration.  However, he only reports that it is slightly difficult to maintain the erection until completion of intercourse.  Patient has no significant past medical history.  He has never had any previous testicular infections.  He denies any history of injuries to the groin and he has never been told that he has a hernia.<|eot_id|>"}

It should help you feel a lot better. \nPatient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, you'll be relieved to know that it's less than one percent.

Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. \nDoctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? \nPatient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. \nDoctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. \nDoctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

My nurses tell me she fell today.\nPatient: Yeah, I fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon at about one thirty.\nDoctor: Where does it hurt, young lady?\nPatient: It's really bad here on my left elbow. \nDoctor: Which hand do you write with?\nPatient: I use my right hand for everything, thank goodness for that. \nDoctor: Before seeing me, have you seen anyone else?\nGuest_family: Yeah, we went to an Urgent Care and she had an x ray there. \nDoctor: What else did they do?\nGuest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction.\nDoctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now?\nGuest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. \nDoctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\nPatient: Yes, I do. \nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \nPatient: Yes, it is. \nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \nGuest_family: What should we do?\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.\nGuest_family: O R I F? What's that\nDoctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. \nGuest_family: Will this not heal on its own? \nDoctor: No, we need to do the surgery. \nGuest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How is this possible?\nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: Will she be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?\nDoctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I have a workers comp claim open.\nDoctor: Your pain came back while working there, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: Do you remember when your last appointment here was? \nPatient: Um, yes, it was on April twelfth two thousand five. \nDoctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit? \nPatient: Um, I'd say it was an eight out of ten. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicine for this? \nPatient: Um, I had a Medrol Dosepak prescribed at my last visit. \nDoctor: How did your pain respond to the Dosepak? \nPatient: It took it down to about a four or five out of ten. \nDoctor: Can you point to me where the pain is, sir? \nPatient: Yes, it's right here. \nDoctor: This band right here? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the spot. \nDoctor: Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum.

He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994.  I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim.  Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.<|eot_id|>"}

We put on some bacitracin ointment, and it almost healed up. But today I noticed that another small blister on her head. It really scared me, and I did not want to take any chance. That's why I reached out to the Infectious Disease center. I know it is private. But still, I don't want to take any chance with my baby's health. I called the center directly and they asked me to come to the hospital. \nDoctor: You did good. I will start the treatment.

I've got a lot going on. \nDoctor: How long have you been feeling this way?\nPatient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. \nDoctor: Has it been getting worse recently? \nPatient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms? \nPatient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for this?\nPatient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. \nDoctor: What other problems are you having? \nPatient: My foot keeps breaking out. \nDoctor: Has this improved at all? \nPatient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. \nDoctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? \nPatient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. \nDoctor: How was this treated?\nPatient: They gave me Nizoral cream.\nDoctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.\nPatient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  \nDoctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? \nPatient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? \nDoctor: Have you ever done that before? \nPatient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. \nDoctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. \nPatient: Cool, can we do blood work, too?

I know you have history of it being high. \nPatient: You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it. \nDoctor: That's good, it's really hard to quit. \nPatient: Yeah, I tried chewing tobacco, but it's not the same. \nDoctor: Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|>"}

He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.

Has she been to P T?\nGuest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. \nDoctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? \nGuest_family: Yes, she has been.

The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. \nGuest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? \nDoctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. \nGuest_family: What is that?\nDoctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. \nGuest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.\nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Will I need to go back to P T?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay.

The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.

At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee.  The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008.  She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008.

You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant. He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.<|eot_id|>"}

It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.

Any blood in your urine? \nPatient: Nope. I do leak, especially when I'm changing my positions like from sitting to standing so I do feel there is some involuntary urination. It's more like a urge. I'm loading data in like every one hour in the morning, especially when I take that Lasix. \nDoctor: Does it taper off in the afternoon or night? \nPatient: It tapers off in the afternoon. And by the night I don't do not feel anything. \nDoctor: Any leakage in the night? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Do you apply a lot of force to urinate? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about this stream? Is it good or less? Are you emptying well? And what about the bowel movement? \nPatient: The stream is good. It does feel like all is out in one go. I do not have any kind of bowel issues. I'm using my vaginal cream. Sometimes I feel difficulty in doing so because I feel that there is still something coming out from the vagina and I'm afraid that there might be a prolapse. \nDoctor: Don't worry, I will look into it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient presents today for followup.

The E D told us to come here. We're here to see if we could get the stuff in his leg taken out. \nDoctor: I see. Did he have a fracture before? \nGuest_family: Yeah, he did. Here's the report from the surgery from October two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: Great. Let me take a look. It looks like he had a distracted left lateral condyle fracture. He then underwent screw compression to fix the fracture, correct? \nGuest_family: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. So, now we just have to remove the hardware that was used to fix the fracture, right? \nGuest_family: Yeah, that's correct. What are the risks of the surgery? \nDoctor: The risks include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion.  \nGuest_family: Oh, wow. That's a lot. Could you go over the benefits?\nDoctor: Of course. Before I do, I just need to confirm your son's age. \nGuest_family: He can tell you. \nPatient: Hi. I'm five years old. My birthday is in four months. \nDoctor: Thank you. Happy almost birthday. \nGuest_family: He gets excited about birthdays. I just have a few more questions, but it looks like we're going to go through with the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 5-year, 8-month-old male who presented to me direct from ED with distracted left lateral condyle fracture.
