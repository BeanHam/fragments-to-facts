My asthma has been acting up. \nDoctor: Oh no. How long has this been going on? \nPatient: For the past three months. I've been using my inhaler every day. I used to use it every now and again. This is definitely new for me. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma? \nPatient: Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too. \nDoctor: Did the Flonase or Advair help at all? \nPatient: I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts. \nDoctor: How so? \nPatient: I noticed that it became more itchy as a result. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.  \nPatient: Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody.  \nDoctor: Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle? \nPatient: Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding. \nDoctor: Are your cycles generally regular? \nPatient: For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end. \nDoctor: Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Have you had any other medical troubles recently? \nPatient: I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it. \nDoctor: Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine? \nPatient: Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it. \nDoctor: Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like? \nPatient: Nothing now.  \nDoctor: Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently? \nPatient: No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again. \nDoctor: I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see? \nPatient: Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \nDoctor: That would be great. Thank you. Let me write down our fax number for you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 42-year-old white female who comes in today for a complete physical and follow up on asthma.  She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. \nDoctor: What's been the problem with her feet?\nGuest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. \nDoctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?\nGuest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. \nDoctor: Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. \nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?\nPatient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. \nGuest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. \nGuest_family: What does that procedure entail? \nDoctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. \nGuest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? \nDoctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.\nGuest_family: How is this possible, doctor?\nDoctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.

Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus. \nPatient: Which bone is that?\nDoctor: That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region. \nPatient: What are we going to do about this? \nDoctor: Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?\nPatient: No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall. \nDoctor: Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. \nPatient: Why is that?\nDoctor: There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death. \nPatient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?\nDoctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean. \nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia.\nPatient: Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.<|eot_id|>"}

He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the \"bad crowd\" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.<|eot_id|>"}

You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant. He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you confirm your age?\nPatient: Fifty eight. I feel like my balance is off, and I've been feeling tired and weak. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this? \nPatient: It's been going on for six to eight weeks. \nDoctor: I see. Did you feel any other symptoms? \nPatient: I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started. \nDoctor: Interesting. Did you take any medication for that? \nPatient: I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right? \nPatient: Yeah, that's right. \nDoctor: How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics? \nPatient: Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened? \nPatient: I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall. \nDoctor: How high were you when you fell?\nPatient: I think I was three or five feet high when I fell. \nDoctor: Did you fall on your back?\nPatient: No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back.  \nDoctor: Funny. Did anything hurt after your fall?\nPatient: Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back. \nDoctor: Did you always have that pain? \nPatient: No, I haven't. It comes and goes. \nDoctor: Have you done anything to treat it? \nPatient: I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back. \nDoctor: I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this? \nPatient: No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor. \nDoctor: Okay. So, it wasn't the result of the adjustments. Is there anything else that may have caused it? \nPatient: I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper. \nDoctor: It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?\nPatient: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication. \nDoctor: I see. I have one more question. Do you have any trouble controlling your bowel movements or attempting to go to the bathroom? \nPatient: Nope. I feel like I'm able to go to the bathroom whenever I want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.<|eot_id|>"}

The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. \nDoctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? \nPatient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. \nDoctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? \nPatient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. \nDoctor: Did you drive yourself? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: How did the antiinflammatories work? \nPatient: Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner. \nDoctor: Was there any leg numbness? \nPatient: Yes. Since December eleventh. \nDoctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.  \nDoctor: What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? \nPatient: He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong.

This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?\nPatient: Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often.\nDoctor: Oh boy, that's a lot going on!\nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?\nPatient: No, it's fine.\nDoctor: And are you taking anything for constipation? \nPatient: Well, just prune juice.\nDoctor: Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help. How bout cough? Any pain in the ribs while coughing?\nPatient: Nah, I am not bothered by it.\nDoctor: Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?\nPatient: Um, no I am fine.\nDoctor: Any fall or imbalance problem?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any agitation or any other issues? \nPatient: Well, I am doing okay! Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me.\nDoctor: That's good!\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. \nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: And no side effects, right?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. \nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?\nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOverall, the patient has been doing reasonably well.  She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her.  There has been a note that she is constipated. Her blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188.  I see a couple in the 150s.  However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year. She is not having problems with breathing.  No neurologic complaints or troubles.  Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.<|eot_id|>"}

So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. \nGuest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? \nDoctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.\nGuest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? \nDoctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. \nGuest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey?

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.

Before we begin your physical, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please? \nPatient: I'm forty two years old and identify as white. \nDoctor: Thank you. I also see that you're here for a follow up for your asthma, correct? How is your asthma? \nPatient: That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping? \nPatient: Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it. \nDoctor: You don't take it every day then? \nPatient: Nope. Only when I feel like I need to. \nDoctor: I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping? \nPatient: I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past. \nDoctor: I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it? \nPatient: I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area. \nDoctor: I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine.\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Has your urine been checked since then? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.\nPatient: I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work.\nDoctor: Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas. Could you send that to me when you get the results? \nPatient: Of course.

She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Good morning. So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|eot_id|>"}

I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom.

This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.

Is there anyone else in your family who has battled cancer? \nPatient: I'd say about thirty some people on my dad's side had cancer. A lot of them had colon cancer and two girls had breast cancer. Oh and I remember learning from one of our cousins that we have some weird genetic syndrome that runs in the family, but I couldn't give you the name. I don't think any of us have been able to figure out the name. Sucks that we have so many problems. \nDoctor: It's definitely difficult to process, however, it's good that you and your family are aware so that you're able to seek preventative measures and get tested early for these particular cancers. If you recall the name of the genetic syndrome, please feel free to call me back so that I can update your records.  \nPatient: Sure thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMother is 61 years old and brother is 39 years old, both alive and well. Father died at 48 of colon cancer and questionable pancreatic cancer. One paternal uncle died at 32 of colon cancer and bile duct cancer. One paternal uncle had colon cancer in his 40s. Thirty cancers are noted on the fathers side of the family, many are colon; two women had breast cancer. The family was told that there is a genetic syndrome in the family, but no one remembers the name of the syndrome.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Jones, sir. \nPatient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|eot_id|>"}

Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?\nPatient: Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember.\nDoctor: That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first. \nDoctor: Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation. \nPatient: Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember. \nDoctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. \nPatient: What does it mean?\nDoctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?\nPatient: Hm, okay.\nDoctor: So tell me what happened? How did you fall?\nPatient: I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock.\nDoctor: Which side did you hit the rock?\nPatient: Um I think it was left side.\nDoctor: What happened in the emergency room?\nPatient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. \nDoctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.\nDoctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. \nDoctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?\nPatient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. \nDoctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?\nPatient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident. \nDoctor: That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?\nPatient: I don't think so.\nDoctor: How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: how about shortness of breath?\nPatient: No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.<|eot_id|>"}

In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\nPatient: Yes, I do. \nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \nPatient: Yes, it is. \nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \nGuest_family: What should we do?\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.\nGuest_family: O R I F? What's that\nDoctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. \nGuest_family: Will this not heal on its own? \nDoctor: No, we need to do the surgery. \nGuest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How is this possible?\nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: Will she be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?\nDoctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose.\nGuest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Did it help? \nPatient: I did some. It was helping me with my neck pain. But this right hand is still feeling weak. I feel it is difficult at times to open jars and open doors. Many times, I drop items. \nDoctor: Is it happening with both hands or one is more than the other? \nPatient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. \nDoctor: Anything else that you noticed? \nPatient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that. \nDoctor: Are you seeing anyone for that? \nPatient: Yeah, Doctor X is trying to help me, uh, with that without surgery. His methods are good it and it is helping me with my neck pain, but not hand. \nDoctor: Are you having any issues with your bowel movements? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any pain in the lower side of your back or in your legs? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any problem with walking or stability? \nPatient: Nope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.

She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.

What seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}

It was verified that I was having a stroke on the same day. \nDoctor: Did they put you on some medications? \nPatient: They gave me an anticonvulsant and aspirin. \nDoctor: Are you taking them regularly? \nPatient: There have a few times like one or two days that I forgot to take my, uh, dyphenhydramine, but even when I'm taking it regularly, I'm still having all those symptoms or forgetfulness, confusion, and everything. \nDoctor: Do you feel anything else along with these episodes like a urine urgency, tendency to bite your tongue, headaches, any visual change, or your heart is beating very fast? Any kind of weakness or numbness or shortness of breath? \nPatient: No nothing else, just the confusion and forgetfulness. \nDoctor: How frequent are these episodes? \nPatient: Well, they occur like two or three times in a week.

He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The \"stroke\" was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above.

I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes doctor, that's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand? \nPatient: I use my right hand for everything. \nDoctor: Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?\nPatient: I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: What were your initial symptoms? \nPatient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too. \nDoctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?\nPatient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \nPatient: That means tumor, right?\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.  She had received fluid rehydration.<|eot_id|>"}

Patient: Sure. \nDoctor: So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months. \nPatient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results. \nDoctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like? \nPatient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed? \nPatient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up. \nDoctor: How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home? \nPatient: I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.\nDoctor: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? \nPatient: Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache. \nDoctor: Do you snore? \nPatient: I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep. \nDoctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep? \nPatient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night. \nDoctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore? \nPatient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.\nDoctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime? \nPatient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours. \nDoctor: Do you smoke? \nPatient: Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner. \nDoctor: Have you noticed any change in your weight? \nPatient: My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago. \nDoctor: If that was your maximum how is your weight now? \nPatient: Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds. \nDoctor: So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel. \nPatient: That sounds right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient presented initially to the Pulmonary Clinic with dyspnea on minimal exertion.  At that time, she was evaluated and found to have evidence for sleep disruption and daytime fatigue.  She also complained of nocturnal choking episodes that have since abated over the past several months.  In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results. The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks. During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours. The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner. She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.  Since that time, her weight is down by approximately 30 pounds. The patient is managed in Outpatient Psychiatry and at her Maintenance Clinic.  She takes methadone, trazodone, and Seroquel.<|eot_id|>"}

That's a nice compliment for a sixty year old lady. \nDoctor: How can I help you today?\nPatient: I have these super bad headaches. Help me, please. \nDoctor: When did they start?\nPatient: I had them since I was twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Oh, wow. That long? Did you get them every day since then?\nPatient: Not every day. That's crazy. I did get them more when my husband died in nineteen ninety six. I was heartbroken. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How did the headaches feel? \nPatient: It felt like a drum in my head. \nDoctor: I haven't heard that description before. Would you say it was pulsating? \nPatient: Something like that. Yes. \nDoctor: Did you take any medication? \nPatient: Lots of it. My son wrote it on a paper so that I could give you the names. Here you go. \nDoctor: I see you were given papaverine. Did that help? \nPatient: They did. My headaches would vanish. \nDoctor: How long did you take it for? \nPatient: I think six months. My headaches stopped for a while, but they came back in two thousand and four. \nDoctor: How often would you say you get headaches now? \nPatient: I think more than before. Like one to two per week. I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours. \nDoctor: Do you take the papaverine when you feel it? \nPatient: I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.  \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever experience any problems with your vision too? \nPatient: Yes. A lot. There were zig zag lines coming out of nowhere. I thought I was going to die. \nDoctor: Oh, wow. I will do a test right now to check your vision. \nPatient: Will you use a bright pen? \nDoctor: I will. Does it give you any discomfort? \nPatient: The bright light hurts my eyes. \nDoctor: I see. I'll only do it to the side then. Just look forward for me, please. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: Are you able to see the light? \nPatient: What light? \nDoctor: It looks like you have trouble seeing things in your peripheral vision. The discomfort you experience with bright lights is also called photophobia. \nPatient: That sounds scary. Will I be fine? \nDoctor: Yeah. You don't have to worry. Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness right now? \nPatient: Now that you mentioned it, I am. \nDoctor: Have you ever fainted before? \nPatient: I think one time. My son was there to help. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. I'll write down that you experienced a syncope. Did you take any medication for this?\nPatient: I took some Russian medicine.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Are you from Russia? \nPatient: No. I'm from Ukraine. \nDoctor: That's wonderful. How did the medicine help? \nPatient: It helped me a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}

Is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir. \nDoctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now. \nDoctor: Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop. \nDoctor: Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?\nGuest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven. \nDoctor: Good, so how have you been treated for this so far? \nPatient: We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. \nGuest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. \nDoctor: Have they taken x rays yet?\nPatient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. \nDoctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. \nPatient: What, where? Can you show me?\nDoctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. \nGuest_family: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. \nGuest_family: Yes, his father agrees.

Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.<|eot_id|>"}

The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.\nDoctor: How old are you, miss?\nPatient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. \nDoctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?\nPatient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.

Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.\nDoctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.\nDoctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?\nPatient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.\nDoctor: What work you do?\nPatient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher.

The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.<|eot_id|>"}

I had numbness and tingling with burning pain in my hands.\nDoctor: You do not have any siblings that we can try for transplant match?\nPatient: That's right! \nDoctor: You were also considered for the Matched Unrelated Donor Transplant, but you couldn't be on the list due to social support and also health was in reasonably better state than other candidates normally on that transplant list.\nPatient: We had some medications here as well when I first started my care here, I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Yes, here we started you on a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for some time. You were doing great on that for a while, but then you developed intolerance to lenalidomide. \nPatient: Yes, I had severe diarrhea and I always felt tired like I have no energy left in me. Eventually it all stopped. \nDoctor: Yeah, here it says that you injured your leg? Tell me what happened. \nPatient: It all happened last week, I injured this left leg and got swelling. I had some prescribed steroids, so I took them for about three days only. The swelling is eventually gone now.\nDoctor: Any other related complaints?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Do you smoke or drink?\nPatient: I take marijuana. I feel really hungry after smoking it, so I eat a lot.

In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them.  He is JAK-2 positive.  He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health. At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped. The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.<|eot_id|>"}

Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. \nDoctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? \nPatient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. \nDoctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. \nDoctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.<|eot_id|>"}
