She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.\", 'dialogue': \"Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?\\nPatient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. \\nDoctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? \\nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \\nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \\nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \\nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \\nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \\nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \\nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \\nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \\nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \\nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \\nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \\nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \\nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \\nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \\nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \\nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \\nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \\nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \\nPatient: No, none. \\nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \\nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \\nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \\nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \\nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \\nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \\nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \\nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \\nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \\nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \\nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \\nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \\nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \\nPatient: Yes, we think so.\", 'ents': ['Lexapro', 'Tylenol', 'Mylanta', 'tremor', 'sores', 'verapamil', 'heartburn', 'Aleve']}\n"

Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.

I'm still in a lot of pain. \\nDoctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?\\nPatient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. \\nDoctor: Have you taken any medicines? \\nPatient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \\nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \\nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \\nDoctor: Did that do anything?\\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \\nDoctor: How did this work? \\nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \\nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \\nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \\nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \\nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \\nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \\nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \\nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \\nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \\nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.\", 'ents': ['Neurontin', 'Lexapro', 'Cymbalta', 'Topamax', 'pain']}\n"

As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.', 'dialogue': \"Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? \\nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \\nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \\nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \\nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \\nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \\nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \\nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \\nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \\nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \\nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \\nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \\nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \\nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \\nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \\nPatient: Sounds good. \\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \\nPatient: That's reassuring. \\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \\nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \\nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \\nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \\nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \\nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \\nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \\nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \\nPatient: Yeah, I did. \\nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \\nPatient: Sounds good. \\nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \\nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \\nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.\", 'ents': ['fullness', 'sinusitis', 'dizziness', 'sensorineural hearing loss', 'infection', 'allergy']}\n"

She also complained of nocturnal choking episodes that have since abated over the past several months.  In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results. The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks. During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours. The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner. She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.  Since that time, her weight is down by approximately 30 pounds. The patient is managed in Outpatient Psychiatry and at her Maintenance Clinic.  She takes methadone, trazodone, and Seroquel.\", 'dialogue': \"Doctor: So, you are here to review your sleep study results, right? \\nPatient: That's right. \\nDoctor: First let's go back to your medical history a little bit and then we will continue with the result. Patient: Sure. \\nDoctor: So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months. \\nPatient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results. \\nDoctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like? \\nPatient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six. \\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed? \\nPatient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up. \\nDoctor: How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home? \\nPatient: I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.\\nDoctor: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? \\nPatient: Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache. \\nDoctor: Do you snore? \\nPatient: I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep. \\nDoctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep? \\nPatient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night. \\nDoctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore? \\nPatient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.\\nDoctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime? \\nPatient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours. \\nDoctor: Do you smoke? \\nPatient: Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner. \\nDoctor: Have you noticed any change in your weight? \\nPatient: My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago. \\nDoctor: If that was your maximum how is your weight now? \\nPatient: Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds. \\nDoctor: So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right? \\nPatient: Yes, that's right. \\nDoctor: Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel. \\nPatient: That sounds right.\", 'ents': ['cough', 'snoring', 'fatigue', 'headache', 'dyspnea', 'Seroquel']}\n"

He had gone to an outside clinic the day prior to presentation complaining of weakness and fatigue. Labs drawn there revealed a potassium of 7.0 and he was told to come here for further evaluation. At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.', 'dialogue': \"Doctor: I will ask some simple questions, okay?\\nPatient: Hm\\nDoctor: How old are you and how would you define yourself in terms of ethnicity?\\nPatient: Well, I am forty seven and would proudly call myself as Latin American. \\nDoctor: Great. What brings you to the emergency room? \\nPatient: I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\\nDoctor: Okay.\\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \\nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \\nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \\nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \\nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \\nPatient: Nope. \\nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \\nDoctor: Which side left or right?\\nPatient: I think its left. \\nDoctor: For how long?\\nPatient: I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too. \\nDoctor: Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?\\nPatient: No. \\nDoctor: What about your bowel movements?\\nPatient: Nope everything is as usual. \\nDoctor: Any change in urinary habits?\\nPatient: Nope.\\nDoctor: Any changes in your skin?

He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.  No fractures noted however.  He felt that the pain is pretty severe and particularly worse in the morning.  His sinuses are bothering him.  He wonders about getting some nasal saline spray.

He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.', 'dialogue': \"Doctor: When was your injury, sir? \\nPatient: Um, if I recall, it was on November twentieth two thousand eight. \\nDoctor: What do you do for a living, sir? \\nPatient: I work at the Purdy Correctional Facility, doctor. \\nDoctor: How did you get hurt?\\nPatient: Well, an inmate broke some of the overhead sprinklers, and I slipped on all the water and I landed on the back of my head, and then onto my back. \\nDoctor: Which side took most of the hit? \\nPatient: It was mostly on my left side. \\nDoctor: How were you after the fall? \\nPatient: Well, I was pretty stunned, mostly. I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \\nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \\nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \\nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \\nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \\nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \\nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \\nDoctor: When was this? \\nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \\nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \\nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \\nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \\nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \\nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \\nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \\nDoctor: How did she treat you? \\nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \\nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \\nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\\nPatient: Some radiation. \\nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck.
