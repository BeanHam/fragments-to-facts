I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages. \nDoctor: Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it? \nPatient: Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down.\nDoctor: Is it like specific to any particular area of your head? \nPatient: It is like all over but, uh, very much intense in the forehead. \nDoctor: Is there any nausea associated with the headaches? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Anything else that happens along with these headaches? \nPatient: Yeah, I get that ringing sound in my ears, and I just don't feel well. \nDoctor: Any changes in your vision? \nPatient: Yeah, it gets blurry, and I feel like lights are dimming.

She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.

Well, he's about five and a half now, and he broke both the bones in his forearm in September of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did the fracture heal? Generally, children heal very well. \nGuest_family: Well, yes, until he also rebroke it about a month ago. \nDoctor: Yes, I see now, there's an ulnar nail pretty prominently visible under the skin, did he have surgery for this? \nGuest_family: Yes, about a month ago now. Should we remove the nail?\nDoctor: We'll have to, even though its early.\nGuest_family: What will we do after the nail is removed? \nDoctor: After that, we'll put him back in a cast for about another three weeks. We'll evaluate him and see how he's doing.  \nGuest_family: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks. I have not seen anything bad happen before.\nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.  The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago.  The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones.  The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.

Sometimes during these episodes I just turn pale and it's like overall weakness. I feel so tired. My husband, he gives me some sugar, three teaspoons, and then it helps a little bit but not completely. \nDoctor: So, is your weakness like overall in your legs or it is at any single point? \nPatient: It's overall. I remember in one of these episodes I was, like, in an odd fisted posture. \nDoctor: Is there any change in your sensations?

Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. \nDoctor: What's been the problem with her feet?\nGuest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. \nDoctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?\nGuest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. \nDoctor: Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. \nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?\nPatient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. \nGuest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. \nGuest_family: What does that procedure entail? \nDoctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. \nGuest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? \nDoctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.\nGuest_family: How is this possible, doctor?\nDoctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed.

Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.<|eot_id|>"}

We use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \nPatient: Even though it's on my hand, will I be asleep for this procedure? \nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Okay, yes.

Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information. \nPatient: Sure, no problem, doctor.\nDoctor: First, how old are you?\nPatient: I'm fifty six, doctor. \nDoctor: Good, did the nurses talk to you about the weight they took today?\nPatient: No, they did not. \nDoctor: Well, ma'am, you're obese. That's posing a serious danger to your health. \nPatient: Yes, I know. I've been trying to lose weight. \nDoctor: Good, so, what seems to be troubling you today?\nPatient: Well, I have a history of degenerative arthritis in my hips, so my other doctors have said.\nDoctor: How have you been treated for this?\nPatient: I had a right hip replacement with Doctor X in two thousand. \nDoctor: Did this help the pain?\nPatient: Yes, on the right, but over the last three years or so the pain on the left hip has been getting worse. \nDoctor: Has it gotten worse faster recently?\nPatient: Yeah, over the last few months it's gotten really bad. \nDoctor: What kind of medications are you taking for this?\nPatient: Honestly, it's gotten so bad, its uncontrollable pain at this point. I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. \nDoctor: Are you able to do any activities?\nPatient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. \nDoctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. \nPatient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?\nDoctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure. I would not worry about any of these things since you have had a replacement before with no issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months. Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the  procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns today? \nPatient: I have been dropping things. \nDoctor: What do you mean dropping things? \nPatient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\nPatient: I travel every chance I get.

Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease.

Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air.
