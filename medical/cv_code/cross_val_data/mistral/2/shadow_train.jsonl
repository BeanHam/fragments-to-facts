Your English is excellent now. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: How old are you? \nPatient: I just turned seventy four last month. \nDoctor: Happy birthday! \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: So, your primary care physician sent you here for possible hydrocephalus. \nPatient: Is that the water on brain thing? \nDoctor: Yes. \nPatient: Then, yes. \nDoctor: Can you tell me about the symptoms that you have been having. \nPatient: I think I have been walking funny lately. I have also been losing my balance.\nDoctor: How do you know that you have been walking funny? \nPatient: My husband noticed that I have been walking funny. He noticed it about over six months ago or so. \nDoctor: What do you notice about the way your wife's walk that has changed?\nGuest_family: She walks wider then she used to, and I noticed that she stooped over. She walks much slower than she did before. She is often losing her balance. I have noticed her touching the walls and furniture to stabilize herself. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you noticed her stabilizing herself all of a sudden? \nGuest_family: No. It has been happening more and more over the last six months or so. \nDoctor: What else have you noticed about the way she walks? \nGuest_family: I noticed that she is having trouble stepping up onto things like a scale. She seems very unbalanced. She also seems to take her time as she walks. She can't be hurried. \nDoctor: That is good that you are taking your time. Do you use any devices to assist you to get around? Like a cane or a walker? \nPatient: No. \nGuest_family: I must help her get in and out of the car. Not every time but sometimes. I am very concerned because she has been falling more and more recently.\nPatient: I have had one emergency room visit. \nDoctor: What happened that you had to go to the emergency room? \nPatient: I fell. I was walking to the bedroom. I lost my balance so I put my hand out to brace myself against the wall and my hand slipped. I fell on my wrist. \nGuest_family: She broke her wrist.\nDoctor: When did this fall happen?\nPatient: March two thousand and seven.\nGuest_family: She has fallen a few times since she broke her wrist. It makes me so nervous. \nDoctor: I can see why that would make you nervous. Have you had any headaches? \nPatient: No. I never get headaches.\nDoctor: Aren't you lucky. \nPatient: Yes, I guess so. \nDoctor: Have you had any problems with your memory or cognitive abilities? \nPatient: I am still able to pay the bills on time. I don't feel as smart as I used to be.  I do feel like my thinking has slowed down over the last few months. \nDoctor: What is your perspective on her memory and her cognitive abilities? \nGuest_family: I have noticed some changes. She will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use to finish the sentence. \nDoctor: Has she ever had trouble finishing a sentence the in the past? \nGuest_family: No, she has always been very well spoken never has lost thoughts. \nDoctor: Have you had any fainting or vertigo episodes? \nPatient: I have not fainted. I have had some dizzy spells in the past but not recently. \nDoctor: Have you had and problems with your bowel movements? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any bladder issues or frequent urination? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Okey. Let us do some an exam. \nPatient: Okey. [/INST] The patient is a lovely 74-year-old woman who presents with possible adult hydrocephalus.  Danish is her native language, but she has been in the United States for many many years and speaks fluent English, as does her husband. With respect to her walking and balance, she states \"I think I walk funny.\"  Her husband has noticed over the last six months or so that she has broadened her base and become more stooped in her pasture.  Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself.  She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance.  She does not festinate.  Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed.  She does not need to use an assistive device.  She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car.  Recently she has had more frequent falls.  In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist.  Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls. With respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency. The patient does not have headaches. With respect to thinking and memory, she states she is still able to pay the bills, but over the last few months she states, \"I do not feel as smart as I used to be.\"  She feels that her thinking has slowed down.  Her husband states that he has noticed, she will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use as she is continuing. The patient has not had trouble with syncope.  She has had past episodes of vertigo, but not recently.</s>"}

I forgot why they gave it to me.  \nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \nDoctor: I see.

All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.

In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.

[/INST] The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.</s>"}

Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment.

That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No. [/INST] This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.</s>"}

Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no.

[/INST] The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.</s>"}

Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke. [/INST] The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.</s>"}

She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that.

She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected.

The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.</s>"}

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful medical assistant! Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.\n\nDoctor: Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy. [/INST] The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.</s>"}

I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five.

I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\nPatient: Some radiation. \nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two. [/INST] This patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.</s>"}

After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care. [/INST] The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.</s>"}
