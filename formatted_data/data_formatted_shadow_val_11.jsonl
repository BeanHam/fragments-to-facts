Oh, maybe fifteen years. At least. \nDoctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same? \nPatient: It is worse right now. \nDoctor: When did the pain become worse? \nPatient: I don't know. It has been getting more painful since it started. Little by little. \nDoctor: Where is the pain? \nPatient: It's in my neck. \nDoctor: Can you show me where the pain in the neck is coming from?\nPatient: It is coming from this area right here. \nDoctor: Right at the base of the neck then? \nPatient: Yeah, I guess. \nDoctor: What does the pain feel like? \nPatient: It hurts.\nDoctor: Mean is the pain sharp or dull? \nPatient: It is sharp. \nDoctor: Okey. Do you have any problems with your mobility? \nPatient: Yes. I am a bit unsteady on my feet. I walk like a duck. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? \nPatient: It had been a few years. \nDoctor: Has it become worse over that time? \nPatient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns today? \nPatient: I have been dropping things. \nDoctor: What do you mean dropping things? \nPatient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \nDoctor: Okay. \nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \nDoctor: Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life? \nPatient: No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain.  He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

It's just that I am not sure how will I feel after an hour. \nDoctor: How long have you had these symptoms?\nPatient: It has been going on for many months. At first, I ignored everything but now It feels like I am not myself any more with all these mood swings.\nDoctor: Do you work?\nPatient: Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals.\nDoctor: How are you doing at work with your mood swings?\nPatient: Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues.\nDoctor: Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?\nPatient: Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket. \nDoctor: Do you know what you were diagnosed with?\nPatient: It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again. \nDoctor: Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?\nPatient: Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket. \nDoctor: Have you ever been on antidepressants?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any hot flashes or night sweat?

You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?\nPatient: Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. Anything else that I should be aware of?\nPatient: Oh yeah, the insomnia, I am hardly sleeping. At times I feel like a zombie. \nDoctor: Any surgeries in the past?\nPatient: Yeah, I had some complications and they had to remove my complete uterus along with tubes and ovaries.\nDoctor: Oh!

She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications.  The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication.  She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past.  She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia.

How long ago did you get that transplant? \nPatient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. \nDoctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant. He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.<|eot_id|>"}

When did you get hurt? \nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \nDoctor: What did they do for you?\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \nDoctor: Did this help at all?\nPatient: No, not at all. \nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \nDoctor: When did you see them? \nPatient: That was back in April. \nDoctor: What did they recommend? \nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news.

The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you confirm your age?\nPatient: Fifty eight. I feel like my balance is off, and I've been feeling tired and weak. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this? \nPatient: It's been going on for six to eight weeks. \nDoctor: I see. Did you feel any other symptoms? \nPatient: I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started. \nDoctor: Interesting. Did you take any medication for that? \nPatient: I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right? \nPatient: Yeah, that's right. \nDoctor: How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics? \nPatient: Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened? \nPatient: I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall. \nDoctor: How high were you when you fell?\nPatient: I think I was three or five feet high when I fell. \nDoctor: Did you fall on your back?\nPatient: No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back.  \nDoctor: Funny. Did anything hurt after your fall?\nPatient: Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back. \nDoctor: Did you always have that pain? \nPatient: No, I haven't. It comes and goes. \nDoctor: Have you done anything to treat it? \nPatient: I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back. \nDoctor: I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this? \nPatient: No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor. \nDoctor: Okay. So, it wasn't the result of the adjustments. Is there anything else that may have caused it? \nPatient: I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper. \nDoctor: It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?\nPatient: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication. \nDoctor: I see. I have one more question. Do you have any trouble controlling your bowel movements or attempting to go to the bathroom? \nPatient: Nope.

He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems.

I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.\nDoctor: I see. Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.<|eot_id|>"}

Last week, he ate some celery and the same thing happened.  They had not given him any of that since.  He eats other foods without any apparent pain or vomiting.  Bowel movements are normal.  He does have a history of reactive airway disease, intermittently.  He is not diagnosed with intrinsic asthma at this time and takes no medication regularly.<|eot_id|>"}

Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?\nPatient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. \nDoctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}
