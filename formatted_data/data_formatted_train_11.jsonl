Oh, maybe fifteen years. At least. \nDoctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same? \nPatient: It is worse right now. \nDoctor: When did the pain become worse? \nPatient: I don't know. It has been getting more painful since it started. Little by little. \nDoctor: Where is the pain? \nPatient: It's in my neck. \nDoctor: Can you show me where the pain in the neck is coming from?\nPatient: It is coming from this area right here. \nDoctor: Right at the base of the neck then? \nPatient: Yeah, I guess. \nDoctor: What does the pain feel like? \nPatient: It hurts.\nDoctor: Mean is the pain sharp or dull? \nPatient: It is sharp. \nDoctor: Okey. Do you have any problems with your mobility? \nPatient: Yes. I am a bit unsteady on my feet. I walk like a duck. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? \nPatient: It had been a few years. \nDoctor: Has it become worse over that time? \nPatient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same.

I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems.

I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh.  I have been having trouble with my right hand.

But any way, after he and his brother got done eating with chicken, they both felt bad and have continued to feel bad.  The patient has had diarrhea five to six times a day for the last four days and then he had emesis pretty frequently three days ago and then has just had a couple of it each day in the last two days.  He has not had any emesis today.  He has urinated this morning.  His parents are both concerned because he had a fever of 103 last night.  Also, he ate half of a hamburger yesterday and he tried drinking some milk and that is when he had an emesis.  He has been drinking Pedialyte, Gatorade, white grape juice, and 7Up, otherwise he has not been eating anything.<|eot_id|>"}

He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|eot_id|>"}

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes doctor, that's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand? \nPatient: I use my right hand for everything. \nDoctor: Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?\nPatient: I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: What were your initial symptoms? \nPatient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too. \nDoctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?\nPatient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \nPatient: That means tumor, right?\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.<|eot_id|>"}

We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing.

I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.\nDoctor: I see. Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.<|eot_id|>"}

But he recently started having pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck. \nDoctor: What race does your family identify with?\nGuest_family: We're white, doctor. \nDoctor: Okay, how long has he had this pain? \nGuest_family: It's been, um, about two months now. \nDoctor: Has the pain improved any since it began?\nPatient: Well, it's a little better now. \nGuest_family: Yeah, he says it's almost gone now, but he was at a point where he was in so much pain that he would cry. \nDoctor: Is this behavior unusual for him?\nGuest_family: Yes, he's not really a complaining kid. \nDoctor: I see. Was he playing and everything before this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I like playing sports with my friends. \nDoctor: Has he had any illnesses, or stomach issues in the past? \nGuest_family: No, nothing major, he just has some allergies. \nDoctor: What kind of allergies? \nGuest_family: He just deals with seasonal allergies.\nDoctor: So, does he just take a Claritin for this?\nGuest_family: Correct. \nDoctor: Is there any swelling? \nGuest_family: Not really, the other doctor said he saw some though. \nDoctor: Are there any other major medical conditions that you're aware of, anything at all?\nGuest_family: No, there's absolutely nothing to report.\nDoctor: Has he ever had a rash on the painful area?\nGuest_family: No. \nDoctor: Any diarrhea, fevers, weigh loss, or mouth ulcers?\nGuest_family: No. Just canker sores, but no to everything else. \nDoctor: Is he going to the bathroom fine?

At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point.  He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid.  There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems.  He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it.  Other than that, he has not had any other problem.  Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow.  There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores.

How are you doing today? \nPatient: I hurt my left wrist again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?\nPatient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. \nDoctor: I see. How did you hurt it? \nPatient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. \nDoctor: Did it hurt before that? \nPatient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. \nDoctor: The recent injury made it worse?\nPatient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. \nDoctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? \nPatient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. \nPatient: My scapho- what? \nDoctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist.

Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.

What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.

She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.

She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.

It was completely resected. It was shown not to be N Myc amplified and had some favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Great. Did he have a follow up after?\nGuest_clinician: He did. There was a second primary in his right adrenal gland. They performed a biopsy, which was consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Did he receive any chemotherapy?\nGuest_clinician: He is now being treated with it per protocol P nine six four one and not on study. His last chemotherapy appointment was on May twenty first two thousand and seven. They used carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.\nDoctor: What did they do after chemotherapy? \nGuest_clinician: He received G C S F daily because he had neutropenia that delayed his second cycle. \nDoctor: Thank you, Nurse. I'll go talk to the mother. \nGuest_clinican: No problem, Doctor. \nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. It's nice to see you again. How is your little boy doing?\nGuest_family: Not so well. Since out last visit, he had a stuffy nose for a couple of days. \nDoctor: Is it getting worse?\nGuest_family: I think it's getting better now. It isn't as stuffy. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. Has he been sick or had any fevers?\nGuest_family: Nope. Just the stuffy nose.\nDoctor: Has he been able to eat anything?\nGuest_family: At times, he didn't want to eat. It seemed like he wasn't hungry. \nDoctor: Does he still have a reduced appetite?\nGuest_family: Not anymore. He's starting to eat again.\nDoctor: Did he have any nausea or vomiting after he ate?\nGuest_family: Thankfully, no. I would have made my husband clean up the vomit. \nDoctor: That's great. Is he able to pee and poop fine? No diarrhea, right?\nGuest_family: His poop has been solid. I haven't seen anything bad about his pee either. \nDoctor: Great. Would you be able to open his mouth for me? I just want to check if everything's fine inside. \nGuest_family: Of course. Say ah. \nPatient: Ah. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks like he's showing some symptoms of thrush again. \nGuest_family: Oh, no. Should we restart fluconazole?\nDoctor: It's just a fungal infection inside the mouth. I'll prescribe him fluconazole. It should get rid of it. \nGuest_family: Thank you so much. You all have been so helpful. My little boy is slowly getting better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected.

She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management.  Her 14-day average is 191.  She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low.  She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100.  She was able to manage this completely on her own.  In the meantime, she is not having any other medical problems that have interfered with glucose control.

Right.\nDoctor: Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? \nPatient: It's been about ten days now. \nDoctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? \nPatient: No, they keep getting worse. \nDoctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? \nPatient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. \nDoctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? \nPatient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. \nDoctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? \nPatient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. \nDoctor: Did you drive yourself? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: How did the antiinflammatories work? \nPatient: Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner. \nDoctor: Was there any leg numbness? \nPatient: Yes. Since December eleventh. \nDoctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.  \nDoctor: What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? \nPatient: He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong.

On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95.

I've had this pain in my left shoulder and neck for the last year and a half.\nDoctor: I see, have these symptoms been persistent for the last year and a half? Or do they come and go?\nPatient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.\nDoctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?\nPatient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. \nDoctor: Have these symptoms progressed? \nPatient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. \nDoctor: How did your P C P handle this?\nPatient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. \nDoctor: Do you remember the results of that study?\nPatient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.\nDoctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? \nPatient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. \nDoctor: Did you have any other imagine done? \nPatient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. \nDoctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? \nPatient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. \nDoctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?\nPatient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse. \nDoctor: Okay, going back to the workouts you were doing, are you sure you can't remember anything that would have set this pain off? \nPatient: No, nothing there. \nDoctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?\nPatient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. \nDoctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?\nPatient: No, honestly every position makes it hurt.\nDoctor: Okay, and we've already done two M R I s of the neck, and I've talked about those with you, correct?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I saw another surgeon who wanted to do, um, a decompression procedure. \nDoctor: Do you want to go forward with the surgery?\nPatient: No, not really.

This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

Single or with a partner? \nPatient: I'm single. \nDoctor: Are you working somewhere? \nPatient: No, currently I'm unemployed.\nDoctor: Okay, since you are an established patient here in our dermatology department, let me just update all your information into the records. \nDoctor: Okay according to my records we have last seen you here in our office on July thirteenth of two thousand and four.\nPatient: Yeah, I think so.\nDoctor: I have previously treated you with Aristocort cream and Cetaphil cream. I also ask you to increase your moisturizing cream and lotion and asked you to wash your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.\nPatient: I've been doing all that, but now it looks like my eczema is flaring. I have these cracks in my hands and they feel very dry. \nDoctor: Have you been washing your hands with Cetaphil cleansing lotion? \nPatient: No, I was using soap. The Cetaphil cleansing lotion was not working.  I had a lot of pain and burning sensation whenever I tried to use that. \nDoctor: It may be because of the fissures. I mean those cracks in your hands. \nPatient: I have been wearing gloves as much as I can. \nDoctor: Okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 29-year-old Vietnamese female, established patient of dermatology, last seen in our office on 07/13/04.  She comes in today as a referral from ABC, D.O. for a reevaluation of her hand eczema.  I have treated her with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion, and wash her hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.  She comes in today for reevaluation because she is flaring.  Her hands are very dry, they are cracked, she has been washing with soap.  She states that the Cetaphil cleansing lotion apparently is causing some burning and pain because of the fissures in her skin.  She has been wearing some gloves also apparently.  The patient is single.  She is unemployed.<|eot_id|>"}

That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? \nGuest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint.\nDoctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. \nGuest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent. \nGuest_family_1: Oh, wow, that's low, how is that possible? \nDoctor: We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean. Other Risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness.\nGuest_family_1: Wow, that's great, will be he asleep the entire time? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia, he won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family_1: Will this fix his pain, for sure?\nDoctor: I can't guarantee it, he may still be in some pain. \nGuest_family_1: Okay, what about you, dear?

The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I also see that you're here for a follow up for your asthma, correct? How is your asthma? \nPatient: That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping? \nPatient: Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it. \nDoctor: You don't take it every day then? \nPatient: Nope. Only when I feel like I need to. \nDoctor: I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping? \nPatient: I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past. \nDoctor: I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it? \nPatient: I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area. \nDoctor: I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine.\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Has your urine been checked since then? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.\nPatient: I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work.\nDoctor: Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas.

She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

Since then, he has been complaining of issues with his shoulder. He is not able to raise his hand above his head and sometimes at night he complains of numbness in his right hand fingers. That kind of made me worried.\nDoctor: Hm, okay. Mom, did he get hurt anywhere else too, like head, face or chest? \nGuest_family: No, he landed on his shoulder thankfully. Didn't hit his head. He was also wearing a helmet.\nDoctor: Okay, so are you giving him anything for his shoulder, like pain meds or anti inflammatory to ease his stiffness?\nGuest_family: No, nothing. Although I gave him some honey for his sore throat. He has been complaining of a sore throat, he has a long standing history of strep throat and he did have some exposure to strep. \nDoctor: Hm, did he have any fever or rashes? \nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation?\nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Okay, let me check his shoulder, do you have any other concerns?\nGuest_family: Actually yes, Jay suffers from A D H D, he-\nDoctor: He is seeing Doctor B, right? \nGuest_family: Yes, and the doctor has prescribed him Adderall and Zoloft once a day. With medication he is doing well in school, he is socializing. Overall, he is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications well.\nDoctor: Okay, so what is the concern?\nGuest_family: However, I have noticed that whenever he is not taking his medications, he is having anger outbursts which he is not able to control. He does realize that it's a problem but he can't help it, and this worries me. We have talked about getting help and he has agreed for counselling. I was just wondering if there is anything which can help him, any therapy or counselling session that might benefit him?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is here today with his mom for several complaints.  Number one, he has been having issues with his right shoulder.  Approximately 10 days ago he fell, slipping on ice, did not hit his head but fell straight on his shoulder.  He has been having issues ever since.  He is having difficulties raising his arm over his head.  He does have some intermittent numbness in his fingers at night.  He is not taking any anti-inflammatories or pain relievers.  He is also complaining of a sore throat.  He did have some exposure to Strep and he has a long history of strep throat.  Denies any fevers, rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.  He is also being seen for ADHD by Dr. B.  Adderall and Zoloft.  He takes these once a day.  He does notice when he does not take his medication.  He is doing well in school.  He is socializing well.  He is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications.  However, he is having issues with anger control.  He realizes when he has anger outbursts that it is a problem.  His mom is concerned.  He actually was willing to go to counseling and was wondering if there was anything available for him at this time.<|eot_id|>"}

Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. \nDoctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? \nPatient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. \nDoctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. \nDoctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.

Thank you. \nDoctor: So, you are here for your follow up right? Remind me how often are you coming here? \nPatient: That's right. I'm coming around between a month or two. \nDoctor: Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks. \nPatient: I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know. \nDoctor: Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant? \nPatient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. \nDoctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well.

Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|eot_id|>"}

This is where you're feeling the pain, right?\nPatient: Yes, it hurts so bad there. \nDoctor: There's some deformity here at the second toe as well. \nPatient: Yes, I see what you're talking about. \nDoctor: Going back to that surgery thirteen years ago, did you heal up well?\nPatient: Since that surgery this bunion has slowly been coming back. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: Please, look at my left foot, do those toes look strange to you?\nDoctor: Yes, you have that deformity in the second and third toes of the left foot as well. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means you have some arthritis in these toes. What do you do for a living?\nPatient: I see. I work in the hospital.\nDoctor: Can I assume you're on your feet all day for work?\nPatient: Yes, I have to stand all day every day. \nDoctor: Do you wear supports, or any kind of orthotics? \nPatient: Yes, I wear orthotics. \nDoctor: Do those provide any relief? \nPatient: They definitely give me some relief, but I'm still in so much pain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.

Has she been to P T?\nGuest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. \nDoctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? \nGuest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. \nDoctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? \nPatient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.\nGuest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?\nDoctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. \nGuest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? \nDoctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. \nGuest_family: What is that?\nDoctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. \nGuest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.\nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Will I need to go back to P T?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay.

The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.<|eot_id|>"}

Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \nDoctor: Was she slurring?\nGuest_family: Nope. \nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \nDoctor: How was it after that? \nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.<|eot_id|>"}

Despite frequent decreases in her insulin regimen, she continues to have somewhat low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning when the glucoses have been in the 70s despite decreasing her Lantus insulin from around 84 units down to 60 units, which is a considerable change.  What I cannot explain is why her glucoses have not really climbed at all despite the decrease in insulin.  The staff reports to me that her appetite is good and that she is eating as well as ever.

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom.

She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.

I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. \nDoctor: Any history of surgery? \nPatient: I have a pacemaker. \nDoctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? \nPatient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms now? \nPatient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. \nDoctor: Is that your main concern? \nPatient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. \nPatient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. \nPatient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. \nDoctor: Has it been for some time? \nPatient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. \nDoctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any neck pain? \nPatient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. \nDoctor: Have you used anything for your pain? \nPatient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little. It does give me sometimes around three hours of relief. Gabapentin did not work at all. \nDoctor: How is your sleep?\nPatient: I cannot sleep properly because of the pain. It has been for many years. I haven't had a proper sleep. \nDoctor: When did you get your pacemaker? \nPatient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. \nDoctor: Do you have any back pain?\nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any change in bathroom routine? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? \nPatient: No, nothing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}
