Me and my husband have been in the States for many many years. When we first got here, we did not speak a word of English. \nDoctor: Wow! Your English is excellent now. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: How old are you? \nPatient: I just turned seventy four last month. \nDoctor: Happy birthday! \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: So, your primary care physician sent you here for possible hydrocephalus. \nPatient: Is that the water on brain thing? \nDoctor: Yes. \nPatient: Then, yes. \nDoctor: Can you tell me about the symptoms that you have been having. \nPatient: I think I have been walking funny lately. I have also been losing my balance.\nDoctor: How do you know that you have been walking funny? \nPatient: My husband noticed that I have been walking funny. He noticed it about over six months ago or so. \nDoctor: What do you notice about the way your wife's walk that has changed?\nGuest_family: She walks wider then she used to, and I noticed that she stooped over. She walks much slower than she did before. She is often losing her balance. I have noticed her touching the walls and furniture to stabilize herself. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you noticed her stabilizing herself all of a sudden? \nGuest_family: No. It has been happening more and more over the last six months or so. \nDoctor: What else have you noticed about the way she walks? \nGuest_family: I noticed that she is having trouble stepping up onto things like a scale. She seems very unbalanced. She also seems to take her time as she walks. She can't be hurried. \nDoctor: That is good that you are taking your time. Do you use any devices to assist you to get around? Like a cane or a walker? \nPatient: No. \nGuest_family: I must help her get in and out of the car. Not every time but sometimes. I am very concerned because she has been falling more and more recently.\nPatient: I have had one emergency room visit. \nDoctor: What happened that you had to go to the emergency room? \nPatient: I fell. I was walking to the bedroom. I lost my balance so I put my hand out to brace myself against the wall and my hand slipped. I fell on my wrist. \nGuest_family: She broke her wrist.\nDoctor: When did this fall happen?\nPatient: March two thousand and seven.\nGuest_family: She has fallen a few times since she broke her wrist. It makes me so nervous. \nDoctor: I can see why that would make you nervous. Have you had any headaches? \nPatient: No. I never get headaches.\nDoctor: Aren't you lucky. \nPatient: Yes, I guess so. \nDoctor: Have you had any problems with your memory or cognitive abilities? \nPatient: I am still able to pay the bills on time. I don't feel as smart as I used to be.  I do feel like my thinking has slowed down over the last few months. \nDoctor: What is your perspective on her memory and her cognitive abilities? \nGuest_family: I have noticed some changes. She will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use to finish the sentence. \nDoctor: Has she ever had trouble finishing a sentence the in the past? \nGuest_family: No, she has always been very well spoken never has lost thoughts. \nDoctor: Have you had any fainting or vertigo episodes? \nPatient: I have not fainted. I have had some dizzy spells in the past but not recently. \nDoctor: Have you had and problems with your bowel movements? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any bladder issues or frequent urination? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Okey.

Danish is her native language, but she has been in the United States for many many years and speaks fluent English, as does her husband. With respect to her walking and balance, she states \"I think I walk funny.\"  Her husband has noticed over the last six months or so that she has broadened her base and become more stooped in her pasture.  Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself.  She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance.  She does not festinate.  Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed.  She does not need to use an assistive device.  She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car.  Recently she has had more frequent falls.  In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist.  Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls. With respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency. The patient does not have headaches.

So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. \nGuest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? \nDoctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.\nGuest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? \nDoctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. \nGuest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey?

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

This pain she is having is in her foot.  She had surgery on it, and she has plates and screws.  She said she was suppose to see Dr. XYZ about getting some of the hardware out of it.  The appointment was cancelled, and that is why she came here.  It started hurting a lot yesterday, but she had this previous appointment with Dr. XYZ so she thought she would take care of it there, but they would not see her.  She did not injure her foot in any way recently.  It is chronically painful.  Every time she does very much exercise it hurts more.  We have x-rayed it in the past.  She has some hardware there.

He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back.
