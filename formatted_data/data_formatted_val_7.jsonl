I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

So Bariatric Surgery Center evaluated you today for band placement surgery for weight loss, right?\nPatient: Yes that's when they found out I have gallstones and they want to take my gallbladder out before we do any weight loss surgeries.\nDoctor: Yes we need to do that surgery before to avoid any risk of infections due to diabetes and it might infect the band.\nPatient: They were supposed to do the surgery today. I wanted it to be done on December thirty first of two thousand nine, but Doc they said that my sugar is high today.\nDoctor: Oh, let me see. Oh wow four thirty eight! It is high.\nPatient: Yes, they are going to treat my high glucose in the hospital.\nDoctor: Okay let's get admitted then. Also, how is your sleep apnea?\nPatient: It is okay.

It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.

I've got a lot going on. \nDoctor: How long have you been feeling this way?\nPatient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. \nDoctor: Has it been getting worse recently? \nPatient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms? \nPatient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for this?\nPatient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. \nDoctor: What other problems are you having? \nPatient: My foot keeps breaking out. \nDoctor: Has this improved at all? \nPatient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. \nDoctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? \nPatient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. \nDoctor: How was this treated?\nPatient: They gave me Nizoral cream.\nDoctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.\nPatient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  \nDoctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? \nPatient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? \nDoctor: Have you ever done that before? \nPatient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. \nDoctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. \nPatient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. \nDoctor: Well, that's called P S A. \nPatient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. \nDoctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. \nPatient: You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it. \nDoctor: That's good, it's really hard to quit. \nPatient: Yeah, I tried chewing tobacco, but it's not the same. \nDoctor: Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|>"}

Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.  She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week.  These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.  She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.<|eot_id|>"}

Number one, he has been having issues with his right shoulder.  Approximately 10 days ago he fell, slipping on ice, did not hit his head but fell straight on his shoulder.  He has been having issues ever since.  He is having difficulties raising his arm over his head.  He does have some intermittent numbness in his fingers at night.  He is not taking any anti-inflammatories or pain relievers.  He is also complaining of a sore throat.  He did have some exposure to Strep and he has a long history of strep throat.  Denies any fevers, rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.  He is also being seen for ADHD by Dr. B.  Adderall and Zoloft.  He takes these once a day.  He does notice when he does not take his medication.  He is doing well in school.  He is socializing well.  He is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications.  However, he is having issues with anger control.  He realizes when he has anger outbursts that it is a problem.  His mom is concerned.  He actually was willing to go to counseling and was wondering if there was anything available for him at this time.<|eot_id|>"}

What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well.

I see he has previously had an operation on the right knee, can you tell me more about that? \nGuest_family: He previously had a lot of trouble straightening out both of his legs, and since the right was worse than the left he had an operation on the inside part of the back of that leg. \nDoctor: When was this operation? \nGuest_family: It was in February of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did he respond to the operation? \nGuest_family: He responded really well, he was walking much better, and even got back to playing sports with the other kids in the neighborhood. \nDoctor: What seems to be the problem today? \nGuest_family: Now, his left knee is getting really bad, it's like how the right knee was. He can't straighten this leg. I think we should do the same operation again on the left knee. \nDoctor: Yes, I think we'll have to do surgery. \nGuest_family: What is the risk of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's been less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics in order to minimize infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be under anesthesia for the procedure?\nDoctor: Yes, he will be. He won't feel anything. \nGuest_family: Will this completely solve his problem?\nDoctor: I can't guarantee that he won't need additional procedures in the future. The other risks include, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion to the leg, failure to restore normal anatomy, and risk it won't work in general. \nGuest_family: What's the name of this procedure? \nDoctor: It's called a distal medial hamstring release.\nGuest_family: This is the same procedure he had in two thousand seven, right? \nDoctor: Yes ma'am, the exact same one.  \nGuest_family: Okay, that sounds good, we want to go through with the procedure. \nDoctor: Okay, here is my surgical scheduler's business card, give them a call, and they can walk you through everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 12-year-old boy born at a 32-week gestation and with drug exposure in utero.

The patient presents now with worsening left knee flexion contracture, and desires the same procedure to be performed.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.

It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.
