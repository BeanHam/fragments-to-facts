What was the name of the surgery, again?\nDoctor: It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today? \nPatient: Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain. \nDoctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?\nPatient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicines? \nPatient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \nDoctor: Did that do anything?\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \nDoctor: How did this work? \nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \nDoctor: Which side left or right?\nPatient: I think its left. \nDoctor: For how long?\nPatient: I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too. \nDoctor: Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: What about your bowel movements?\nPatient: Nope everything is as usual. \nDoctor: Any change in urinary habits?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: Any changes in your skin? Any rash? Any kind of eyesight issue?\nPatient: Nope, no changes.\nDoctor: What about pain? Like headache or any joint pain? \nPatient: Nope, no pain anywhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 47-year-old Latin American man presented to the emergency room after being told to come in for a high potassium value drawn the previous day. He had gone to an outside clinic the day prior to presentation complaining of weakness and fatigue. Labs drawn there revealed a potassium of 7.0 and he was told to come here for further evaluation. At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.<|eot_id|>"}

I had a third surgery when I was seventy with just a correction of the shaft area.  \nDoctor: Um hum. Any other surgeries unrelated to your condition? \nPatient: Yeah. I have it written down here. In two thousand and one there was a left rotator cuff repair with acromioplasty and distal clavicle resection and in two thousand and three I had a left inguinal hernia repair with M E S H.

Despite frequent decreases in her insulin regimen, she continues to have somewhat low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning when the glucoses have been in the 70s despite decreasing her Lantus insulin from around 84 units down to 60 units, which is a considerable change.  What I cannot explain is why her glucoses have not really climbed at all despite the decrease in insulin.  The staff reports to me that her appetite is good and that she is eating as well as ever.

I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. \nDoctor: Any history of surgery? \nPatient: I have a pacemaker. \nDoctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? \nPatient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms now? \nPatient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. \nDoctor: Is that your main concern? \nPatient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. \nPatient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. \nPatient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. \nDoctor: Has it been for some time? \nPatient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. \nDoctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any neck pain? \nPatient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. \nDoctor: Have you used anything for your pain? \nPatient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little. It does give me sometimes around three hours of relief. Gabapentin did not work at all. \nDoctor: How is your sleep?\nPatient: I cannot sleep properly because of the pain. It has been for many years. I haven't had a proper sleep. \nDoctor: When did you get your pacemaker? \nPatient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. \nDoctor: Do you have any back pain?\nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any change in bathroom routine? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? \nPatient: No, nothing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

He does realize that it's a problem but he can't help it, and this worries me. We have talked about getting help and he has agreed for counselling.

Is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir. \nDoctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now. \nDoctor: Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop. \nDoctor: Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?\nGuest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven. \nDoctor: Good, so how have you been treated for this so far? \nPatient: We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. \nGuest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. \nDoctor: Have they taken x rays yet?\nPatient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. \nDoctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. \nPatient: What, where? Can you show me?\nDoctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. \nGuest_family: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. \nGuest_family: Yes, his father agrees. We're going to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet.

At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.<|eot_id|>"}

This is definitely new for me. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma? \nPatient: Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too. \nDoctor: Did the Flonase or Advair help at all? \nPatient: I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts. \nDoctor: How so? \nPatient: I noticed that it became more itchy as a result. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.  \nPatient: Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody.  \nDoctor: Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle? \nPatient: Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding. \nDoctor: Are your cycles generally regular? \nPatient: For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end. \nDoctor: Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Have you had any other medical troubles recently? \nPatient: I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it. \nDoctor: Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine? \nPatient: Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it. \nDoctor: Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like? \nPatient: Nothing now.  \nDoctor: Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently? \nPatient: No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again. \nDoctor: I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see? \nPatient: Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \nDoctor: That would be great.

She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

He can't straighten this leg.

He doesn't give opiates for chronic back pain. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor? \nPatient: I went to another doctor for another opinion, and he recommended that I follow up at a pain clinic to talk about more treatment options, um, like medicine. I think that's what I need.  \nDoctor: Did you seen the pain management specialist? \nPatient: No, I wasn't feeling well at that time, so I came to the E D and I saw Doctor X. \nDoctor: How did Doctor X treat you?\nPatient: He gave me a prescription for twelve Vicodin and he gave me some more to take home when I left the E D last night. \nDoctor: Did you fill that prescription? \nPatient: No, not yet. I told the nurse too, but I don't think I'll have enough to last through the weekend. \nDoctor: Do you have any medicine at home?\nPatient: I have, um, methadone and Darvocet from previous prescriptions, should I restart those? \nDoctor: Let me write down the medicines you are taking and attach it to the chart.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPatient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain.  Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he \"felt it\" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.<|eot_id|>"}

Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? \nPatient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. \nDoctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, correct. \nDoctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? \nPatient: A little bit, but not much. \nDoctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? \nPatient: It's stayed more or less the same. \nDoctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? \nPatient: Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.<|eot_id|>"}

She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her.  There has been a note that she is constipated. Her blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188.  I see a couple in the 150s.  However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year. She is not having problems with breathing.  No neurologic complaints or troubles.  Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm coming around between a month or two. \nDoctor: Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks. \nPatient: I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know. \nDoctor: Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant? \nPatient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool.

I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. \nDoctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

Last time I was here almost four months ago. \nDoctor: How are you doing since last visit? \nPatient: I have been good. My sugar has been under the range. Unfortunately, my pump was having some issues for the last two weeks. \nDoctor: Oh no. What happened? \nPatient: I don't know. I tried to get it fixed but nothing worked out, so I had to buy a new one and then being old kind of hit me. You know, I was not able to set it up. I was stuck on the pump settings and was having a lot of difficulties.

Did you faint? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about sweating, tired, or lightheadedness and or change in vision?

Sometimes I don't even realize that I missed my meal, but I do keep some snacks with me I'm just eating while completing my work. It might not be the best case scenario, but I don't get any time for any kind of physical activities. \nDoctor: Are you visiting your physician regularly? \nPatient: Of course. I'm very regular. I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done. All was good. \nPatient: This reminded me that we did a lab last time I came. How did it go? \nDoctor: Oh yes, thank you for reminding me. Let's see how your numbers are.

Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?\nPatient: Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember.\nDoctor: That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first. \nDoctor: Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation. \nPatient: Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember. \nDoctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. \nPatient: What does it mean?\nDoctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?\nPatient: Hm, okay.\nDoctor: So tell me what happened? How did you fall?\nPatient: I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock.\nDoctor: Which side did you hit the rock?\nPatient: Um I think it was left side.\nDoctor: What happened in the emergency room?\nPatient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. \nDoctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.\nDoctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. \nDoctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?\nPatient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. \nDoctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?\nPatient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident. \nDoctor: That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?\nPatient: I don't think so.\nDoctor: How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: how about shortness of breath?\nPatient: No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.<|eot_id|>"}

I've had this pain in my left shoulder and neck for the last year and a half.\nDoctor: I see, have these symptoms been persistent for the last year and a half? Or do they come and go?\nPatient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.\nDoctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?\nPatient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. \nDoctor: Have these symptoms progressed? \nPatient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. \nDoctor: How did your P C P handle this?\nPatient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. \nDoctor: Do you remember the results of that study?\nPatient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.\nDoctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? \nPatient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. \nDoctor: Did you have any other imagine done? \nPatient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. \nDoctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? \nPatient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. \nDoctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?\nPatient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse. \nDoctor: Okay, going back to the workouts you were doing, are you sure you can't remember anything that would have set this pain off? \nPatient: No, nothing there. \nDoctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?\nPatient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. \nDoctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?\nPatient: No, honestly every position makes it hurt.\nDoctor: Okay, and we've already done two M R I s of the neck, and I've talked about those with you, correct?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I saw another surgeon who wanted to do, um, a decompression procedure. \nDoctor: Do you want to go forward with the surgery?\nPatient: No, not really. I'm pretty reluctant to do any kind of surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection. \nDoctor: Okay, let me check my records.

Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

It does not appear to be grossly abnormal or causing any loosening or problems on x-ray.<|eot_id|>"}

What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. \nDoctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?\nPatient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.\nDoctor: Are you having any back pain? \nPatient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.\nDoctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? \nPatient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. \nDoctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?\nPatient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.\nDoctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?\nPatient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.\nDoctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?\nPatient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. \nDoctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \nDoctor: Thanks. I see.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|eot_id|>"}

Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago.  Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses.  She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management.  Her 14-day average is 191.  She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low.  She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100.  She was able to manage this completely on her own.  In the meantime, she is not having any other medical problems that have interfered with glucose control.  Her diet has been a little bit different in that she had been away visiting with her family for some period of time as well.<|eot_id|>"}

Upon my questioning of the patient, she can confirm that she has been sick to her stomach and has vomited. She cannot tell me how many times. She is also unable to describe the vomitus. She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.<|eot_id|>"}

I don't know if its related to surgery.

There's gross instability of the fragment, and we don't want that get worse. \nGuest_family: Okay, that's about what we've heard so far. What are the risks of infection of the procedure? \nDoctor: It's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation of the limb, changes in motion, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, the possible need for another procedure, and possible early arthritis. I would not worry, though. These things are rare.\nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep the entire time?\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Okay, my husband agrees.

The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.

I have had these sores in my mouth. \nDoctor: How long have you had the sores?\nPatient: They started about ten to twelve days ago. \nDoctor: We have been currently treating your rheumatoid arthritis with methotrexate. How much have you been taking? \nPatient: Yes, we have tried lots of different treatments and methotrexate has been working well.  I have been on it for ten years now. I have been taking about twenty or twenty five M G of per week. \nDoctor: Did we recently increase your dosage? I see in your chart that we have changed your dosage a few times. \nPatient: About a year ago we lowered the dosage for twenty five M G to twenty but my arthritis flared up so we went to twenty two point five. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any side effects from the methotrexate in the past? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Are you taking any other medications? \nPatient: I had a sinus infection and the doctor put me on an antibiotic. That was about two weeks ago. \nDoctor: Do you know what the antibiotic the doctor gave you? \nPatient: I don't remember the name of the antibiotic, but I know that I have taken antibiotics before and I didn't have a problem. \nDoctor: How long was your antibiotic course? \nPatient: It was three or four days long. I had to take it three times a day. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any history of mouth sores? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Are you taking anything to help with the pain of the mouth sores? \nPatient: I took Aspirin a month ago. I started taking it again because my mouth was sore. \nDoctor: Have you had any other problems with your skin?

The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.<|eot_id|>"}
