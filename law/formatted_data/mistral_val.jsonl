{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Kane, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), rendered June 30, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (two counts).\nAt trial, the People presented the testimony of a police informant, two State Police officers and a State Police forensic scientist. Defendant was the sole witness presented by the defense. The People\u2019s evidence established the sale by defendant of controlled substances to the police informant individually and also to the informant and an undercover police officer in each other\u2019s presence. It was defendant\u2019s contention that the sales were made as an accommodation to and for the benefit of the informant who, defendant further contended, provided the controlled substances which were sold. The jury accepted the evidence presented by the People and rejected the version of events offered by defendant and found defendant guilty on all counts. The trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment having a maximum term of 25 years and a minimum term of 8 Vs years on each count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, to run consecutively, and a lesser term of imprisonment upon the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree to run concurrently with the other sentences imposed.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. The imposition of a maximum sentence does not necessarily mean that the trial court abused its discretion (People v Purdie, 58 AD2d 715). In this case, if the aggregate minimum and maximum periods of imprisonment are added to arrive at an aggregate of each, the terms of imprisonment would be a minimum of 25 years and a maxi mum of 75 years. In such circumstances, however, the Department of Correctional Services is required to calculate defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment so that the aggregate maximum term of imprisonment under the sentences imposed does not exceed 30 years and the aggregate minimum period of imprisonment does not exceed 15 years (Penal Law \u00a7 70.30 [1] [b]). The sentences, as such, are not illegal and do not require modification, but shall be deemed to be within the limits set forth above (see, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575).\nThere is also an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel raised by defendant, who contends, among other things, that his trial counsel should have raised a defense of entrapment. Such a defense would be inappropriate and without foundation or support in this record. Moreover, the necessary elements to provide this defense are negated by defendant\u2019s own testimony. Upon the record in its entirety, we find nothing to suggest that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Nor do we find any merit in the issues raised by defendant pro se. These issues relate to evidentiary matters which do not provide any basis to disturb the verdict of the jury.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey and Weiss, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for multiple counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, rejecting his claims of a harsh and excessive sentence and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found no merit in the defendant's arguments, including the assertion that an entrapment defense should have been raised by his counsel, as the evidence did not support such a defense. The imposed sentences were deemed legal and within statutory limits.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nLynch, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered July 16, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nIn October 2013, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts). He thereafter pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal in open court. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to five years of probation, imposed 100 hours of community service and ordered him to pay restitution. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant maintains that he was deprived of meaningful representation concerning his plea because defense counsel misinformed him that he could still appeal a claim of juror bias. This issue came to light at sentencing. When asked by County Court if he wished to be heard, defendant responded, \u201cI guess the only thing I wanted to say is that I wanted to make sure \u2014 I know you can\u2019t appeal this, but I wanted to appeal the things that \u2014 [defense counsel] said I can go to the [a]ppellate [c]ourt, because the member of the grand jury was a friend of mine for six years, a neighbor.\u201d Defense counsel directly responded that \u201c[h]e certainly can appeal it\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019ve explained it to him probably 20 times\u201d \u2014 leaving little question that \u201cit\u201d refers to the juror bias claim. Defendant countered, \u201cNo, today was the first time you ever explained that to me.\u201d County Court left the issue unresolved, simply responding that \u201cif you feel you have an appealable issue that the Appellate Division can hear you certainly have the right to appeal.\u201d\nWhile defendant couches his claim in terms of an invalid appeal waiver, we find that defendant\u2019s claim actually presents a threshold question of forfeiture, i.e., whether a claim of potential juror bias in the grand jury survives a plea. Notably, defendant made no such specific claim in his preplea motion to dismiss the indictment, contending only generally that the proceedings were impaired by irregularities (see CPL 210.35 [5]; compare People v Washington, 82 AD3d 1675, 1676 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 1106 [2012]). County Court denied the motion, finding no infirmities in the grand jury minutes that would warrant a dismissal. Since we do not perceive the claim to be jurisdictional or to implicate \u201crights of a constitutional dimension that go to the very heart of the process\u201d (People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]), we conclude that a claim of juror bias would actually be forfeited upon a guilty plea (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d at 231).\nInasmuch as defendant\u2019s misunderstanding as to his ability to appeal the juror bias issue was brought to County Court\u2019s attention at sentencing, we find that defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea has been sufficiently preserved for our review (see generally CPL 470.05 [2]; compare People v Garay, 25 NY3d 62, 67 [2015], cert denied 577 US \u2014, 136 S Ct 501 [2015]; People v Green, 54 NY2d 878, 880 [1981]), notwithstanding the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion. Once County Court learned that defendant had been given erroneous advice by counsel, the court should have conducted a further inquiry to ascertain whether defendant wished to go forward with the plea (cf. People v Bendross, 153 AD2d 75, 76-77 [1989]). Absent such inquiry by County Court, and in light of the fact that the record otherwise presents \u201ca genuine issue of fact as to the knowing, intelligent and voluntary nature of defendant\u2019s guilty plea\u201d (People v Bass, 118 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 24 NY3d 959 [2014]; compare People v Santiago, 121 AD3d 528, 528 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]), this matter must be remitted to County Court to afford defendant an opportunity to either accept the plea that was offered or move to withdraw his plea (cf. People v Denegar, 130 AD3d 1140, 1141-1142 [2015]). By so concluding, we are not resolving the question as to whether defendant was deprived of meaningful representation \u2014 only referring that question to County Court for resolution in the first instance.\nEgan Jr., Rose and Aarons, JJ., concur. [/INST] The court addressed an appeal from a defendant convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance, who claimed he received inadequate representation regarding his ability to appeal a juror bias issue. The court found that while the defendant's misunderstanding about his appeal rights was preserved for review, the claim of juror bias would be forfeited upon a guilty plea. Consequently, the matter was remitted to the County Court for further inquiry into whether the defendant wished to proceed with the plea or withdraw it, but the court did not determine if the defendant was deprived of meaningful representation.</s>"}

He and his girlfriend were charged in an indictment with various crimes relating thereto and were jointly represented throughout the course of the proceedings. Ultimately, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a hypodermic needle in full satisfaction of the indictment. As part of the plea agreement, the District Attorney agreed to allow defendant\u2019s girlfriend to plead guilty to two counts of the indictment, and to be sentenced to a $1,000 fine and a three-year period of probation. Both defendant and his girlfriend waived their rights to appeal. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a definite one-year jail term on his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and concurrent six-month jail terms on the remaining charges. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s assigned appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of representing defendant on the ground that there are no non-frivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, however, has filed a pro se submission contesting appellate counsel\u2019s position, arguing that his trial counsel improperly refused his request to withdraw the plea at sentencing and the search of his premises was illegal. Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerns matters outside the present record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Carroll [Barile], 299 AD2d 572, 572-573 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 625, 626 [2003]; People v Perez, 198 AD2d 540, 542 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 929 [1994]). In any event, our review of the record discloses that defendant was fully informed of the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the rights he was waiving thereby. Defendant stated on the record that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and was satisfied with the services of his attorney. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s plea and waiver were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Angus, 303 AD2d 829, 830 [2003]; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]).

Pursuant to an agreement reached with County Court, defendant entered an Alford plea to the charges and began serving a one-year term of interim probation. If defendant successfully completed the interim probation, County Court would sentence her to five years of probation. However, if defendant failed to comply with the terms of the interim proba tion, she could be sentenced to any legally permissible sentence that County Court deemed appropriate. Defendant did not comply with the interim probation and was sentenced to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in accepting her plea without first holding a competency hearing pursuant to CPL 730.30 is not preserved for our review as the record before us indicates that she has failed to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rought, 90 AD3d 1247, 1248 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 962 [2012]; People v Klages, 90 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 925 [2012]). The narrow exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or cast doubt upon the voluntariness of her plea (see id.). Although defendant was taking several prescription medications, the transcripts of her plea and other proceedings reflect that they did not affect her ability to understand the proceedings or make an intelligent choice from among the alternatives available to her (see People v Amidon, 79 AD3d 1158, 1159 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 741 [2011]; People v Gomez, 72 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2010]).\nDefendant also claims that her sentence was harsh and excessive.

Defendant ultimately was extradited from Arizona and arraigned on the indictment in Saratoga County in September 2004. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to an agreed upon sentence of IV2 to 3 years in prison.

While he acknowledges that this challenge is not preserved for our review in that he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction (see People v Booth, 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005]), he nonetheless asserts that his plea comes within a recognized exception to the preservation requirement, to wit, that during the plea allocution he made statements that cast doubt on his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]).

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was permitted to participate in a drug treatment program and, upon successful completion, would be sentenced to no more than five years of probation. Otherwise, County Court had the discretion to sentence defendant up to the maximum statutory prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. Defendant absconded from the drug treatment program and, following his return to court in 2015, County Court sentenced him to the maximum prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. Defendant now appeals.\nWe agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that County Court did not explain \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1208 [2017]). Furthermore, although a detailed written appeal waiver was executed by defendant, the court made \u201cno attempt ... to ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver\u201d (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1209 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). As such, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed is not precluded by the appeal waiver.

Upon defendant\u2019s motion, County Court (Bruhn, J.) ordered that the criminal sale counts be reduced to the lesser included crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to all of the counts in the indictment. At sentencing, County Court (Czajka, J.) was erroneously advised that the criminal possession counts had been dismissed. County Court accordingly sentenced defendant upon the criminal sale counts, as agreed, to concurrent prison terms of two years, and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction leaves his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved (see People v Terry, 55 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 931 [2009]). Nor did \u201cthe plea colloquy negate[ ] an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation requirement\u201d (id.). In any event, we are satisfied from our review of the record that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea.\nDefendant\u2019s claim that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel, to the extent that alleged ineffective assistance affected the voluntariness of his plea, is similarly unpreserved given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]). In any event, defendant was made well aware of the charged crimes and his sentencing exposure during his plea colloquy and stated his satisfaction with counsel, and we conclude that defendant received meaningful representation (see id.).\nDefendant also argues that, given the lack of proof as to his knowledge of the weight of the methadone that he possessed and sold, County Court should have dismissed the indictment. That knowledge, however, is not an element of any charged offense (see Penal Law \u00a7 15.20 [4]; People v Estrella, 303 AD2d 689 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 571 [2003]; People v Wilson, 245 AD2d 402, 402 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 946 [1998]). Defendant\u2019s related argument that there was insufficient evidence to indict him upon the original criminal sale counts is waived by his guilty plea (see People v Dunbar, 53 NY2d 868, 871 [1981]; People v Melendez, 48 AD3d 960, 960 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 962 [2008]) and, in any event, those counts were appropriately reduced by County Court (see CPL 210.20 [1-a]).\nLastly, we are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed, which was agreed upon by the parties and included the minimum prison term allowed and a permissible period of postrelease supervision, was harsh and excessive (see People v Nelson, 51 AD3d 1137, 1138 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 739 [2008]).\nMercure, J.P., Rose, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur.

The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of the branches of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which were to suppress identification testimony and physical evidence.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that all the sentences shall be concurrent; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.\nUnder Indictment No. 168/92, the defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree for his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer on November 13, 1991. The same indictment also charged the defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree for unlawfully possessing cocaine with an aggregate weight of 1/s ounce or more on November 21, 1991, and for possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it on the same date.\nThe defendant contends that the undercover police officer\u2019s viewing of a photograph of him two days after the November 13, 1991, transaction was unduly suggestive. However, as the County Court correctly found, this identification procedure was purely confirmatory, i.e., to ascertain whether the correct individual would be arrested (cf., People v Waring, 183 AD2d 271, 273; see also, People v Veale, 169 AD2d 939, affd 78 NY2d 1022).\nThe record reveals that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel provided him with meaningful representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; People v Jefferson, 156 AD2d 716).\nThe defendant\u2019s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated.\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]) or without merit.

The initial prosecution ended in a mistrial, and defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an outstanding parole violation. Defendant waived his right to appeal in writing, which he affirmed during the plea colloquy, and was sentenced, as an admitted second felony offender, to the promised prison term of 2 to 4 years.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea, although not encompassed by his waiver of the right to ap peal, nonetheless is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the underlying judgment of conviction (see People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d 643 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Robetoy, 21 AD3d 1220 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 758 [2005]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). Defendant also, however, challenges the voluntariness of his appeal waiver, and we no longer apply preservation principles to such a challenge (see People v Lewis, 48 AD3d 880 [2008]). Thus, we will review defendant\u2019s challenge to the plea in the interest of justice in conjunction with our review of the voluntariness of the appeal waiver. Indeed, a review of the record does not support defendant\u2019s claims that his plea and accompanying waiver were coerced or that he was not informed of the sentence he would be facing (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10-11 [1989]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d at 881; People v Wyant, 47 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2008]). Defendant unequivocally stated that he had not been threatened or otherwise forced to plead guilty or to waive his right to appeal, and the proposed sentence was plainly and repeatedly disclosed to defendant prior to entering his plea.\nAs to defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, his \u201cfailure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction serves as a bar to this challenge as well\u201d (People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d at 643; see People v Parara, 46 AD3d 936, 937 [2007]). In any event, we find this claim to be unpersuasive. Defendant was represented by three attorneys at the plea allocution who, in addition to securing a very advantageous plea for him, extensively addressed his concerns regarding his related parole violation and his desire to visit with his children while in prison. Defendant not only indicated that he was satisfied with the representation provided but expressed his appreciation for \u201call the work\u201d counsel had done for him. Simply put, there is nothing in the record to suggest that counsels\u2019 representation was less than meaningful (see People v Parara, 46 AD3d at 937). Finally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the agreed-upon sentence is precluded in light of his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).\nMercure, J.P, Lahtinen, Kane and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

The appeal brings up for review the denial (Egitto, J.), after a hearing, of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nPrior to sentencing, the defendant moved to withdraw his plea of guilty predicated upon a misunderstanding of the plea bargain agreement. He thought he would not have to serve any additional period of incarceration, but would be immediately released on parole, because the credit for time served on a previous conviction that had been reversed on appeal satisfied the minimum term of promised sentence.\nAt the time the defendant pleaded guilty, the court promised to impose a sentence of one-year-to-life imprisonment and to resentence the defendant, upon an application pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 60.09, to an indeterminate sentence of 1 to 3 years\u2019 incarceration. The court also advised the defendant that it had no objection to defense counsel applying to the Division of Parole for permission to have the defendant immediately released on parole, in view of the fact the defendant had served approximately 19 months on a prior reversed conviction, and would accord defense counsel sufficient time to make the application. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, both the defendant and his counsel admitted that the court never promised the defendant that he would not have to serve any period of incarceration. Since an objective reading of the plea bargain agreement was susceptible to but one interpretation, the defendant\u2019s misunderstanding of the agreement, or disappointment upon discovering that the Parole Board would require his incarceration for a period of time, does not suffice as a reason for permitting him to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Cataldo, 39 NY2d 578; People v Latine, 71 AD2d 697).

As a result, defendant was charged in a superior court information with two counts of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. She subsequently waived indictment and pleaded guilty to one count in full satisfaction of both charges and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. She now appeals.\nAlthough defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of her plea allocution is precluded by her failure to make a motion to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d 853, 854 [2009]), the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable as defendant\u2019s factual recitation negated an essential element of the crime to which she pleaded guilty (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 672 [2007]). Although a person confined to a detention facility is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree merely by possessing dangerous contraband (see Penal Law \u00a7 205.25 [2]), defendant was not charged with violating that specific subdivision of the applicable statute. Rather, defendant\u2019s crimes are alleged to have been committed in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 205.25 (1), which states that a person is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree if the person \u201cknowingly or unlawfully introduces dangerous contraband into a detention facility.\u201d Indeed, count one of the superior court information charges defendant with \u201cbringing] heroin into the Broome County [Jail]\u201d and count two charges her with \u201cbringing dalmane] into the Broome County [Jail].\u201d\nBefore accepting defendant\u2019s plea to count one, County Court asked her if she brought heroin into the jail and defendant answered \u201cyes.\u201d However, on further inquiry by the court, defendant stated that she found the heroin on the floor of a dressing room within the facility. Although defendant added that \u201c[she] was in possession of it so [she was] guilty,\u201d County Court informed her that \u201cmaybe not. . .

Rather, County Court\u2019s subsequent inquiries pertained strictly to whether defendant brought dalman\u00e9 into the facility and where \u201cin the jail\u201d she found the heroin. Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s responses offered no indication that she was admitting to bringing the heroin into the jail, or that she was even aware of the exact nature of the charge to which she was pleading guilty, we conclude that County Court improperly accepted her guilty plea to count one of the superior court information (see People v Pagan, 36 AD3d 1163, 1165 [2007]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention is rendered academic by our decision.\nCardona, P.J., Rose, Kane and Garry, JJ., concur.

The jury found defendant guilty on the counts of criminal possession and acquitted him on the counts of criminal sale. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to 8V3 to 25 years in prison on each count with the sentences to run consecutively. Contending that the jury\u2019s verdict was repugnant and his sentence excessive, defendant now appeals.\n\u201cA repugnant or inconsistent verdict occurs \u2018where the defendant is convicted of an offense containing an essential element that the jury has found the defendant did not commit (see, CPL 300.30 [5] [\u201c(t)wo counts are \u2018inconsistent\u2019 when guilt of the offense charged in one necessarily negates guilt of the offense charged in the other\u201d])\u2019 \u201d (People v Long, 291 AD2d 720, 722, lv denied 98 NY2d 677, quoting People v Trappier, 87 NY2d 55, 58; see People v Tucker, 55 NY2d 1, 6; People v Hart, 266 AD2d 584, 585, lv denied 94 NY2d 903). In other words, we can determine whether or not a jury reached an \u201cinherently self-contradictory verdict\u201d only by looking at the jury charge in the record (People v Tucker, supra at 8). This limitation exists to prevent appellate courts from intruding into the \u201cjury\u2019s deliberative process by speculating on how the jury perceived and weighed the evidence\u201d (id. at 7).\nAs County Court correctly instructed the jury, a person commits criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree by knowingly and unlawfully selling a narcotic drug (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1]). By contrast, a person commits criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree when he or she knowingly and unlawfully possesses a narcotic drug with intent to sell it (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1]). Defendant\u2019s acquittal on the former does not negate the elements of the latter, for a person can possess and intend to sell a narcotic drug, but not actually accomplish a sale (see People v Ortiz, 170 AD2d 396, 397, lvs denied 77 NY2d 998, 78 NY2d 1079). Also, the evidence supports County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict as inconsistent on the grounds that his possession of the heroin was proven by other circumstantial evidence and was not dependent on the confidential informant\u2019s testimony. Thus, it was not inherently irrational for the jury to have found the elements of criminal possession while discrediting the informant\u2019s testimony as to the sale (see id. at 397; People v Coleman, 120 AD2d 770, 771-772, lv denied 68 NY2d 810).\nFinally, defendant challenges the severity of his sentence, which consisted of the maximum permissible term of imprisonment on each count of criminal possession (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). Running consecutively, those terms aggregate 25 to 75 years in prison. While aware that this period will be administratively reduced to a term of 15 to 30 years (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.30 [1] [e] [iii] [B]; People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908), we nevertheless find it appropriate to further reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780) by directing that the terms imposed shall run concurrently (see People v Harris, 288 AD2d 610, 619, lv granted 97 NY2d 705; People v Lockenwitz, 287 AD2d 891, 892; People v Sheppard, supra at 500). This reduction is warranted by defendant\u2019s young age, the absence of any prior arrests or convictions other than his plea of guilty to a charge of attempted assault in the first degree during the pendency of the drug charges, the absence of violence in his drug offenses, and the fact that two of the drug possessions, though separate, occurred within 30 minutes of each other and all three of them involved the same informant.\nCrew III, J.P., Carpinello, Mugglin and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the sentences imposed upon defendant\u2019s conviction of three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree be served concurrently with each other, and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court reviewed a conviction of the defendant for three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following an acquittal on related sale charges. The court found no repugnant verdict as the jury could reasonably distinguish between possession and sale, and upheld the conviction. However, due to the defendant's young age, lack of prior convictions, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses, the court modified the sentence to run concurrently, reducing the total potential prison time.</s>"}

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to four years to life in prison. In addition, he waived his right to appeal the judgment of conviction as well as the sentence except to the extent a future legislative change in sentencing under the Rockefeller drug laws would entitle him to be resentenced. Defendant was sentenced as agreed and now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that his sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in light of recent legislation amending the Rockefeller drug laws.

Chapter 643 of the Laws of 2005 is the only recent legislation amending the Rockefeller drug laws applicable to those, like defendant, who have been convicted of class A-II felonies. It provides that certain persons convicted of such crimes may apply for resentencing in accordance with Penal Law \u00a7 70.71 in the court that imposed the original sentence (L 2005, ch 643, \u00a7 1). However, persons sentenced for class A-II felonies prior to January 13, 2005 are not eligible for resentencing under the new law (see Senate Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2005, ch 643).

Defendant now appeals, by permission of this Court, from County Court\u2019s denial of his CPL 440.20 motion wherein he argued that the imposition of consecutive sentences on two of the counts \u2014 third degree criminal possession of a weapon and fourth degree criminal possession of a controlled substance \u2014 was illegal under Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 (2).\nInasmuch as a claim that a sentence is harsh and excessive is distinct from a challenge to the legality of a sentence (see generally People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9 [1989]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 799 [2001]), we agree with defendant that County Court incorrectly denied his motion on the ground that the issue of illegal sentence was previously raised on defendant\u2019s direct appeal. Nonetheless, upon reviewing the merits of that claim in the interest of judicial economy, we find it unpersuasive. Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, consecutive sentences on the \u201cweapon possession and drug possession charges were legal, as those are separate and distinct possessory offenses regardless of defendant\u2019s possession of both drugs and a weapon at the same time\u201d (People v Smith, 309 AD2d 1081, 1083 [2003]; see People v Almeida, 39 NY2d 823, 824 [1976]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been examined and found to be without merit.\nPeters, Kavanagh, McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison. His subsequent CPL article 440 motion was denied and he was denied permission to appeal from that order. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction.\nInitially, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant has an extensive criminal background, which includes two prior drug-related convictions, and the negotiated sentence he received was significantly less than the sentence that could have been imposed if he were convicted after trial. Therefore, we do not find the existence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]; People v Daniels, 281 AD2d 651 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 900 [2001]). In addition, because defendant committed the crime well before the effective date of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]), we reject his contention that he should have been sentenced under the new law (see People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676 [2006]).

After accepting the plea, the court admonished defendant that if he failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing the court would be authorized to impose an enhanced sentence of up to SVs to 25 years in prison. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing and was returned to court on a bench warrant several months later and sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. On defendant\u2019s appeal, defense counsel \u2014 following the appropriate procedure \u2014 submitted a brief seeking to be relieved of his assignment as counsel on the ground that no nonfrivolous appealable issues exist (see, People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see also, Anders v California, 386 US 738). The People submitted a letter agreeing with defense counsel\u2019s position. Defendant submitted a pro se letter to this Court arguing that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]) and requesting that new appellate counsel be assigned. For reasons to be explained, we conclude that a decision on this appeal should be withheld, defense counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved of counsel should be granted and new appellate counsel should be assigned.\nWhere, as here, a defendant pleads guilty but did not waive his right to appeal and an enhanced sentence is imposed based upon the trial court\u2019s determination that he or she violated a term of the plea agreement, the defendant has a statutory right to argue on appeal to the Appellate Division that the enhanced sentence imposed \u2014 though lawful \u2014 was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]; 450.10 [2]; People v Thompson, 60 NY2d 513, 518-520; People v Coleman, 30 NY2d 582; see, e.g., People v Morton, 275 AD2d 865; People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713; People v Ramsey, 269 AD2d 616, lv denied 94 NY2d 951; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, lv denied 94 NY2d 879; People v Rogers, 166 AD2d 679; People v Jackson [Everett], 130 AD2d 510; see also, People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780; People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264, 268; People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606).\nTo be distinguished, we have repeatedly adhered to the rule that a defendant\u2019s valid waiver of appeal executed pursuant to a plea agreement generally precludes our review of a claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive, although the legality of a sentence is never waived (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-10; People v Etkin, 277 AD2d 599; People v Smith, 272 AD2d 782, 783, lv denied 95 NY2d 871; People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 790-791, lv denied 95 NY2d 833; People v Johns, 267 AD2d 718, lv denied 94 NY2d 949; People v Young, 253 AD2d 982, lv denied 92 NY2d 1055; see also, People v Ross, 276 AD2d 649; People v lorio, 276 AD2d 564). Thus, in a plethora of appeals wherein the defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently pleaded guilty, waived all appeal rights and received the lawful, negotiated sentence, we affirmed the judgment of conviction and granted defense counsel\u2019s application pursuant to People v Cruwys (113 AD2d 979, supra) and Anders v California (386 US 738, supra) to withdraw (see, People v Carney, 276 AD2d 920; People v Mochrie, 276 AD2d 831; People v Villaronga, 272 AD2d 641; People v Carter, 271 AD2d 708, lv denied 95 NY2d 794; People v Haennel, 269 AD2d 698; People v Kwiatkowski, 268 AD2d 681, lv denied 94 NY2d 949; People v Gage, 261 AD2d 660; cf., People v Cobbs, 276 AD2d 917). We have also affirmed convictions and granted defense counsel\u2019s Anders motions to withdraw in appeals involving defendants who pleaded guilty and were sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement but who did not waive their right to appeal (see, People v Jandreau, 276 AD2d 925; People v Goodrich, 276 AD2d 832; People v Cook, 273 AD2d 543; People v Waddell, 272 AD2d 639; People v Roundtree, 261 AD2d 715).\nLikewise, we have held that where a defendant, who concomitantly validly pleaded guilty and waived all appeal rights receives an enhanced sentence based upon a violation of the terms of the plea agreement, any claim addressed to the harshness or excessiveness of the enhanced sentence falls within the scope of the waiver of the right to appeal, provided the defendant is informed of the maximum potential sentence for noncompliance with the plea agreement (see, People v Perham, 263 AD2d 766, lv denied 93 NY2d 1045; see also, People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, supra; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, supra [upheld waiver on appeal where no sentence promised at plea]; People v Burnice, 272 AD2d 882, lv denied 95 NY2d 863; People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 790-791, supra; People v Miles, 268 AD2d 489, lv denied 95 NY2d 800; cf., People v Covell, 276 AD2d 824 [conditions of plea not clear, therefore appeal waiver did not preclude review of enhanced sentence]; People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63 [defendants entitled to challenge enhancements because waiver of appeal did not encompass plea terms which failed to comport with due process]).\nHowever, where, as here, defendant did not waive his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement and an enhanced sentence was imposed, we cannot conclude that an appeal raising the issue of the harshness and excessiveness of the enhanced sentence would be \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d although, by distinction, it may ultimately be determined to be without merit (see, People v Vasquez, 70 NY2d 1, 3; People v Saunders, 52 AD2d 833, 834; see also, Anders v California, 386 US 738, 744, supra; People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606, 611, supra; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980, supra). Accordingly, since this issue is arguable on its merits, defendant is entitled to assignment of new counsel to argue the appeal (see, People v Cruwys, supra, at 980; People v Saunders, supra, at 834), with the Court taking no position on the merits of the appeal.\nIn withholding a decision and assigning new counsel, we decline to decide the appeal on the record and Anders brief before us, as no immediate decision appears justified or necessary (see, People v Cruwys, supra, at 980; People v Crawford, 71 AD2d 38, 39; People v Saunders, supra, at 834; cf., People v Wasson, 266 AD2d 701, 702, n). Although we have on occasion commented that a particular sentence was not harsh and excessive in the context of affirming a conviction and granting defense counsel\u2019s application pursuant to Anders to withdraw (see, e.g., People v Snow, 273 AD2d 549; People v Phillips, 271 AD2d 760; People v Hastings, 271 AD2d 707; People v Deanne, 270 AD2d 515; People v Ben-Levi, 269 AD2d 697), acceptance of an Anders brief and granting defense counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved more correctly indicate that the issues are \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d and lack any arguable merit and do not result in a determination on the merits of arguable issues (see, Anders v California, supra, at 744; People v Vasquez, supra, at 3; People v Saunders, supra, at 834). Deciding an arguable issue \u2014 such as the fairness of an enhanced sentence \u2014 which a defendant is statutorily permitted to raise in this Court in the absence of the \u201csingle-minded\u201d advocacy of appellate counsel may, in particular cases, work to deprive a defendant of effective assistance of counsel to which he or she is entitled (see, People v Casiano, 67 NY2d 906; People v Gonzalez, supra, at 609-611; People v Emmett, 25 NY2d 354, 356; see also, Anders v California, supra, at 743-744).\nRecognizing that the courts, prosecutors and the defense bar are increasingly grappling with the burden of frivolous appeals and that there has been an increase in the use of Anders briefs, we take this opportunity to offer some guidance. Where a defendant who pleads guilty but does not execute a waiver of appeal receives an enhanced sentence due to noncompliance with terms of the plea agreement and requests assigned counsel to challenge the severity of the sentence or to raise other arguably meritorious issues on appeal, the proper course is to submit a brief addressing these issues as an advocate rather than to submit an Anders brief. We believe that this practice will most effectively \u201cassure that an indigent criminal appellant receives substantially the same assistance of counsel as one who can afford to retain an attorney of his [or her] choice\u201d (People v Gonzalez, supra, at 610; see, Douglas v California, 372 US 353).\nCardona, P. J., Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is withheld, application to be relieved of assignment granted and new counsel to be assigned.\nHowever, if a defendant is not advised at the time of the plea of the maximum sentence he or she could face, the appeal waiver does not encompass the right to challenge the sentence as harsh and excessive (see, People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513; cf., People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825). [/INST] The court reviewed an appeal from a defendant who pled guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance but failed to appear for sentencing, resulting in a longer prison term than initially agreed upon. The defense counsel argued that there were no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, but the court concluded that the defendant had the right to challenge the harshness of the enhanced sentence since he did not waive his appeal rights. Consequently, the court granted the motion to relieve the current counsel and assigned new counsel to address the appeal.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nGarry, J.\nAppeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered October 31, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, and (2) by permission, from two orders of said court, entered February 24, 2015 and August 19, 2015, which denied defendant\u2019s motions pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.\nPursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. The plea agreement included a waiver of the right to appeal, but with a reservation relative to issues arising from the Mapp/suppression hearing. County Court sentenced de fendant, consistent with the terms of the agreement, to an aggregate prison term of six years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that his waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017]; People v Lanahan, 276 AD2d 906, 909 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 965 [2000]). County Court specifically advised defendant that his waiver of appeal was \u201cseparate and apart\u201d from the other waivers related to his guilty plea, which defendant acknowledged both verbally and also by signing a written appeal waiver (see People v Upshur, 150 AD3d 1552, 1553 [2017]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]; compare People v Williford, 124 AD3d 1076, 1077 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1209 [2015]). The valid waiver thus precludes defendant\u2019s challenges based upon the Sandoval compromise, the denial of his motion to suppress certain oral statements, and the asserted Brady violation (see People v Chant, 140 AD3d 1645, 1648 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 970 [2016]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2013]; People v Colon, 101 AD3d 1161, 1161-1162 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]).\nAs to the Mapp issues, defendant claims that the warrant-less search of his residence was improper, and that the consent provided by his girlfriend, with whom he shared the residence, was invalid. At the suppression hearing, a senior investigator with the Town of Coeymans Police Department testified that he assisted a fellow officer in conducting a traffic stop of a vehicle driven by the girlfriend, and observed her \u201cfiddling with her pockets\u201d as he spoke with her. She then produced several oxycodone pills from her pocket and stated that she had a valid prescription for them at her apartment, which she offered to show to the investigator and his fellow officer. Upon their arrival at the apartment, the girlfriend unlocked the door, invited the officers in and showed them a prescription bottle. The bottle did not match the pills that had been found earlier on her person. Upon request, the girlfriend then provided verbal consent for the officers to search the apartment. The second officer picked up a digital scale from atop a kitchen cabinet that had a white powdery residue. The investigator then requested and obtained the girlfriend\u2019s written consent to continue the search. The girlfriend showed the officers to a closet in the bedroom, with an open door and containing both men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, where they found a sweatshirt wrapped around a plastic bag containing over 80 ounces of cocaine.\nWe agree with County Court that the evidence established that the police reasonably relied upon the girlfriend\u2019s apparent authority to consent to the search of the shared premises, including the closet (see People v Cosme, 48 NY2d 286, 292-293 [1979]). \u201cEven in the absence of a warrant, police may lawfully search a residence where an inhabitant with apparent authority to consent to the search freely and voluntarily does so\u201d (People v Grillo, 128 AD3d 1103, 1104 [2015] [citations omitted]). The written consent form did not advise the girlfriend that she had the right to refuse consent, although the investigator testified that he informed her of this verbally. However, neither the failure to give such advice nor the fact that the girlfriend had been briefly handcuffed after she produced the oxycodone pills, without more, necessarily rendered her consent involuntary (see People v Curtis, 144 AD3d 1199, 1200 [2016]; People v Williford, 124 AD3d at 1078). Reviewing the totality of the circumstances presented here, and deferring to County Court\u2019s credibility determinations (see People v Garnsey, 288 AD2d 761, 762 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 754 [2002]), we find that the girlfriend\u2019s consent was freely and voluntarily given.\n\u201cDefendant\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent is not precluded by his waiver of appeal and was preserved by his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his guilty plea\u201d (People v Pixley, 150 AD3d 1555, 1556 [2017] [citation omitted]; see People v Romano, 45 AD3d 910, 912 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]). However, to the extent that defendant asserts that the ineffective assistance of counsel affected the voluntariness of his plea, we find this claim to lack merit. Notably, many of the claims that defendant advances on appeal are the same challenges that his trial counsel had already presented on his behalf, and he received an advantageous plea offer based upon those efforts (see People v Dickson-Eason, 143 AD3d 1013, 1014 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1123 [2016]; People v Briggs, 138 AD3d 1355, 1356 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]). Upon review, we find no error in County Court\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw his plea, which was addressed to its discretion (see People v Young, 112 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1204 [2014]; People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 922 [2010]).\nWe next consider defendant\u2019s related challenge to his predicate felony status, which similarly survives his appeal waiver (see People v Hartfield, 151 AD3d 1116, 1118 [2017]; People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]) and was also preserved for review. In a prior plea offer that defendant had rejected, the People expressed their intent to use defendant\u2019s prior violent felony conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree to determine his predicate felony status. In the course of the subject plea proceeding, County Court stated that defendant would be sentenced as a nonviolent predicate offender to an aggregate prison term of six years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. However, at sentencing, the People filed a predicate felony statement in which they, once again, sought to use defendant\u2019s past violent felony as his predicate offense. Defendant was afforded an opportunity to review that statement and confer with counsel and acknowledged the conviction; defendant\u2019s challenge was that he had filed a motion to vacate that prior conviction. However, that conviction met the statutory requirements to be used as a predicate violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.02 [1] [c]; 70.06 [1] [b]; 70.70 [4] [a]), and we find no error in County Court using it to determine defendant\u2019s predicate felony status (see CPL 400.21; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 20 [1983]; see also People v Hartfield, 151 AD3d at 1118; compare People v Lewis, 45 AD3d 898, 899 [2007]).\nFinally, and significantly, County Court did not increase the agreed-upon prison terms. The six-year prison term, which placed defendant in the middle of the permissible sentencing range if his prior felony conviction was not a violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i]), is the statutory minimum prison term for a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]; [4] [b] [i]). As such, we find that defendant received the benefit of his bargain (compare People v Lewis, 45 AD3d at 899). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.\nPeters, P.J., Rose, Clark and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment and orders are affirmed.\n. Were these issues before us, we would have found that the Brady claim lacks merit, and that County Court reached an appropriate Sandoval compromise (see People v Green, 270 AD2d 566, 568-569 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 853 [2000]) and did not err in denying the motion to suppress defendant\u2019s statements (see People v Rodney, 85 NY2d 289, 293 [1995]).\n. The investigator obtained a search warrant thereafter, based upon the consent previously given.\n. Defendant\u2019s challenge is premised on his assertion that the legislature\u2019s repeal of the subsection under which he was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree prevented County Court from using the sentence as a predicate felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 [former (4)]; L 2006, ch 742, \u00a7 1). However, the Legislature did not decriminalize the act upon which defendant was convicted; instead, that act now constitutes criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 [3]; L 2006, ch 742, \u00a7 2). Regardless, at the time that defendant was convicted, his act constituted a violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [1] [former (c)[; L 2007, ch 7, \u00a7 32).\n. In fact, defendant received an additional benefit when County Court reduced the negotiated postrelease supervision term from three years to two years (see e.g. People v Collier, 91 AD3d 987, 988 [2012], affd 22 NY3d 429 [2013], cert denied 573 US \u2014, 134 S Ct 2730 [2014]). [/INST] Defendant Garry appealed his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, arguing that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, and challenging the validity of the search that led to his arrest. The court upheld the validity of his waiver of appeal and found that the girlfriend's consent to search their shared residence was valid, rejecting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the use of a prior felony conviction for sentencing. Ultimately, the court affirmed the judgment and orders, noting that defendant received the benefits of his plea agreement.</s>"}

At that time, defendant entered into a plea agreement whereupon he pleaded guilty to the above charge with his sentencing deferred pending his participation in the Binghamton Adult Drug Treatment Court program. The agreement provided that defendant was waiving his right to appeal the conviction and sentence and, if defendant successfully completed the drug court program, he would be sentenced to five years of probation. It was also agreed that, if defendant breached the plea agreement, County Court would determine \u201cthe appropriate sentence,\u201d with the understanding that the maximum permissible sentence was 21/s to 7 years in prison. Defendant executed a written consent to these conditions during the plea proceedings. Thereafter, defendant was terminated from his drug treatment program and the court, among other things, imposed a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison, prompting this appeal.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant upon the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMercure, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), rendered May 5, 1986, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree.\nAs a result of an investigation undertaken by the Town of Colonie Police Department in Albany County, defendant was indicted for numerous crimes by a Grand Jury. A jury trial ensued and, after the jury had commenced their deliberations, County Court was advised that a juror was experiencing some health problems. With the consent of the parties, County Court waived the sequestration requirements of CPL 310.10 and the jury was permitted to go home during a recess, separately and unsupervised. Eventually, defendant was found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 22Vz years to life and 12\u00bd to 25 years, respectively. This appeal followed.\nDefendant contends that County Court erred in failing to keep the deliberating jury continuously together under supervision as required by CPL 310.10. We agree. Although this court has held that the provisions of CPL 310.10 could be waived (People v Silvernail, 55 AD2d 72, 75; cf., People v Thomas, 91 AD2d 857; People v Clayborn, 50 AD2d 952), the Court of Appeals has now made it clear that a defendant cannot, consonant with his right to a trial by jury, consent to a procedure at variance with the statute\u2019s mandate that the jury be kept secluded during deliberations (People v Coons, 75 NY2d 796, 797; see, People v Ahmed, 66 NY2d 307, 310-311). Moreover, because the error affects the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings prescribed by law (see, People v Ahmed, supra, at 310; People v Patterson, 39 NY2d 288, 295, affd 432 US 197; see also, People v Coons, supra), it presents a question of law for our review even if acceded to.\nBecause there must be a new trial, we deem it appropriate to note that we find defendant\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal to be without merit, with two exceptions. First, we agree with defendant that his arrest did not justify a search of his entire residence. The police had probable cause to arrest defendant and exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into his residence (see, People v Dominquez, 141 AD2d 833, 834). Thus, the search and seizure of the tangible property in the bathroom was proper, either as a search incident to arrest or under the plain view doctrine (see, People v Knapp, 52 NY2d 689, 694-695, 697). However, once defendant had been apprehended, the urgency had dissipated and the police had time to secure a search warrant (see, supra, at 696). Therefore, any evidence seized outside of the bathroom should have been suppressed.\nFinally, we also note that the admission of testimony that at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest he was found to have $700 in cash on his person, including no part of the \"buy money\u201d, was improper. The Fourth Department has held, and we agree, that \"[i]f a defendant is charged * * * with one isolated drug sale * * * any evidence that [the] defendant was possessed of a large sum of money, either at the time of his arrest or at the time of the sale, is inadmissible\u201d (People v Whitfield, 144 AD2d 915; see, People v Jones, 62 AD2d 356, 357; compare, People v Wells, 159 AD2d 799; People v Jones, 138 AD2d 405, 406, lv denied 71 NY2d 1028).\nJudgment reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for a new trial. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Mercure and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The judgment from the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance and conspiracy, was reversed due to the improper waiver of jury sequestration during deliberations, violating CPL 310.10. Although the court found that the police had probable cause for the defendant's arrest and the search of his bathroom was justified, evidence seized from other areas of the residence should have been suppressed, and testimony regarding the defendant's cash at the time of arrest was deemed inadmissible. The case is remitted for a new trial.</s>"}

In any event, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the suspension of his driver license in this case was a collateral, not a direct, consequence of his plea of guilty (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]; People v Trathen, 121 AD3d 1594, 1595 [2014]; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2013]; People v Goss, 286 AD2d 180, 182 [2001]).

Memorandum: On October 18, 1994, defendant was convicted in Niagara County Court following a jury trial of two drug-related felonies and one misdemeanor. On December 6, 1994, before sentencing on the above offenses, defendant pleaded guilty to another drug-related felony charged in a separate indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment for all four offenses and defendant waived his right to appeal from both judgments.\nThe record establishes that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11), and that waiver forecloses our review of his contention regarding the severity of the sentences (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280-281; People v Pierce, 233 AD2d 872, lv denied 89 NY2d 945). The remaining contention of defendant, that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial on the first indictment, is an issue that survives the waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Callahan, supra, at 280). The record establishes that Supreme Court issued an order converting a pro se habeas corpus petition to a motion under CPL 30.20 and 30.30 and directing that it be referred to County Court for determination. That order also relieved the counsel appointed on the habeas corpus petition, who was not the same counsel who was representing defendant in County Court.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nLahtinen, J.\nAppeal from an order of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), entered June 13, 2003, which granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.\nDefendant was arrested in 1997 when a search of his apartment resulted in the discovery of cocaine. Since a person residing temporarily at his apartment was the primary suspect and defendant\u2019s role was viewed as minor, he was offered a plea agreement whereby he would serve no more than five years probation with four months of weekends in jail. The deal fell through when, during the plea allocution, defendant denied knowing that the individual residing at his apartment was involved in possessing and selling drugs. Defendant was then indicted for, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony. He was convicted and, although County Court indicated a lesser sentence would be more appropriate, it was constrained to impose the minimum permissible jail term of 15 years to life.\nWe reversed based upon errors at the trial (301 AD2d 673 [2003]) and, upon remittal, defendant and the People were unable to agree to the terms of a plea. Defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment in the furtherance of justice. After conducting a hearing on the motion, County Court rendered a detailed written decision addressing each of the statutory factors (see CPL 210.40 [1]) and concluding that dismissal was appropriate. The People appeal.\nWe affirm. Dismissal of an indictment in the furtherance of justice is a remedy, that should be sparingly employed in the limited situations where such relief is supported by compelling reasons (see People v Rickert, 58 NY2d 122, 128 [1983]; People v Kennard, 266 AD2d 718, 719 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 864 [1999]; People v Litman, 99 AD2d 573, 574 [1984]). Here, County Court noted its \u201ctremendous concern\u201d in the disparity between the initial plea offer and the subsequent minimum available sentence after conviction. The court set forth its further concern about the People\u2019s decision to go from a position that defendant had minimal involvement to one of seeking an indictment for an A-I felony. Defendant, who is 57 years old and has serious health problems, served four years in jail before his conviction was reversed. The drug laws under which he was sentenced have been the subject of debate and some recent reform (see L 2004, ch 738). After the reversal, defendant was released on his own recognizance, obtained employment, enrolled in programs directed at addressing his past substance abuse problems and volunteered in community organizations. The court was convinced that defendant had adequately addressed and reformed his personal drug problem. Character witnesses appeared for defendant and the court found their testimony persuasive. County Court stated that there was \u201cnothing to remotely suggest that the community is at risk by [defendant\u2019s] return\u201d and observed that \u201cit is quite plausible that [defendant] will be an asset to the community.\u201d County Court observed that, while defendant acknowledged possessing a small amount of cocaine for personal use, the evidence that he knew about the alleged larger transactions of a co-inhabitant of the apartment was circumstantial and defendant had consistently maintained his innocence in such regard. Upon review of the record, we are unpersuaded that County Court abused its discretion in finding that this case constituted a limited situation where dismissal in the furtherance of justice was warranted (see People v Wong, 227 AD2d 852, 853 [1996]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Peters and Rose, JJ., concur.

The plea agreement contained no promises as to the sentence, and County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 7V2 to 15 years.

The waiver of appeal also encompasses defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance insofar as he does not allege that \u201cthe claimed ineffectiveness induced an otherwise knowing and voluntary guilty plea\u201d (People v McGuffie, 294 AD2d 617, 618 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]; see People v Castano, supra at 687). As we fail to discern any nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on direct appeal, the judgments are affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining argument, raised in his CPL 440.20 motion, is that trial counsel was ineffective because counsel allegedly told him that the plea agreement included a promise that he would receive a sentence of 4x/2 to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment. However, the record contradicts defendant\u2019s claim, since defendant stated during the plea colloquy that no promises had been made by anyone with respect to the sentence (see People v Gene SS., 51 AD2d 1064, 1065 [1976]). In addition, defendant was told on several occasions that no promises as to sentencing were being made, and he indicated that he understood. As such, we perceive no error in County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.30 [4] [c], [d]).\nPeters, Spain, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgments are affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted. Ordered that the order is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the judgments of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, following his guilty plea and waiver of appeal rights. The court denied the defendant's motion to set aside the sentence, finding no merit in his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding a supposed promise of a lighter sentence, as the plea colloquy confirmed no such promises were made. Additionally, the assigned counsel was relieved from representation due to a lack of nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nGarry, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 5, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn satisfaction of a multicount indictment stemming from an incident in which he was discovered operating a motor vehicle containing a quantity of heroin, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was thereafter sentenced in accord with his plea agreement to a prison term of seven years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we find defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal invalid, as County Court \u201cdid not adequately convey that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty but, rather, improperly lumped those rights together\u201d (People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Blackmon, 122 AD3d 1071, 1072 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]). Further, although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, the court\u2019s colloquy was not adequate to ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]).\nTurning to the merits, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the traffic stop of his vehicle was without legal justification. It is fundamental that \u201cprobable cause exists for a traffic stop if an officer observes a defendant committing a traffic violation\u201d (People v Portelli, 116 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2014]). The arresting officer testified at the suppression hearing that defendant\u2019s vehicle passed by his location and he observed that the vehicle did not have an illuminated license plate (see Vehicle and Traf fie Law \u00a7 375 [2] [a] [4]). The officer then followed the vehicle to confirm his initial observation and, upon catching up to it, further observed that the vehicle had excessively tinted windows (see Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 375 [12-a] [b] [2]). The officer then initiated the traffic stop. County Court credited this testimony, and \u201cwe accord great weight to the suppression court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by the record\u201d (People v Morris, 105 AD3d 1075, 1077 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1042 [2013]). Here, as the uncontroverted testimony of the arresting officer confirmed that the stop was initiated only after the officer had observed two violations, we find no error in County Court\u2019s determination that the stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle was justified (see People v Thompson, 106 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2013]; People v Hawkins, 45 AD3d 989, 990-991 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1034 [2008]; People v Brooks, 23 AD3d 847, 849 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 810 [2006]).\nFinally, we disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive. Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of seven years with two years of postrelease supervision despite his plea agreement allowing for a prison term of eight years. Moreover, defendant possesses a lengthy criminal history that spans five decades and includes multiple periods of incarceration. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed (see People v Edwards, 96 AD3d 1089, 1092 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1102 [2012]; People v Kelly, 71 AD3d 1292, 1292-1293 [2010]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are unpreserved.\nLahtinen, J.P., Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following a guilty plea. The appeal was deemed valid, as the waiver of the right to appeal was improperly conveyed by the County Court. The court also upheld the legality of the traffic stop that led to the arrest, finding it justified based on observed violations, and determined that the seven-year prison sentence was not harsh or excessive given the defendant's extensive criminal history.</s>"}

On this appeal, defendant contends that the sentences imposed by County Court are harsh or excessive. Defendant, a second felony offender, received concurrent sentences that were well within the statutory guidelines and were the product of plea bargaining negotiations. Absent any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the interest of justice, the record before us provides no ground upon which to base a modification of defendant\u2019s sentence (see People v Conyers, 285 AD2d 825, 827, lv denied 97 NY2d 680; People v Archangel, 272 AD2d 686, 687).\nThe People concede, however, that the mandatory surcharge of $200 and the crime victim assistance fee of $10, imposed upon defendant for each of his convictions, constituted a violation of the US Constitution\u2019s ex post facto clause because defendant\u2019s convictions arose out of offenses committed in January 2000, prior to the effective date of the amendment to Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 (1) (a).

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 220.39 [1]) and sentencing him as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years.\nThere is no merit to defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of the waiver of the right to appeal. The plea colloquy establishes that defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived the right to appeal (see, People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280). That waiver encompasses defendant\u2019s contentions that evidence should have been suppressed and that police gave perjurious testimony before the Grand Jury (see, People v Lococo, supra, at 827; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737).\nAlthough defendant\u2019s challenge to the legality of the sentence survives the waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), there is no merit to the contention that the sentence was rendered illegal by the way in which the predicate felony issue was handled. During the CPL 400.21 procedure, defendant was properly advised of the consequences of either not contesting, or successfully challenging, the constitutionality of the predicate felony conviction. Thus, Supreme Court discharged its duty under the statute (see, CPL 400.21 [3], [7] [b]; see generally, People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850; People v Polanco, 232 AD2d 674, 675).

More than a year after his release from custody, he moved to vacate his conviction on the ground that he was coerced to plead guilty by his codefendant and other inmates at the jail where he was held prior to his plea. Following a hearing at which several witnesses, including defendant and his codefendant, Harmeen Nix, testified, County Court denied the application. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.\nWe agree with County Court that defendant has not demonstrated that he was under duress at the time of the plea. The transcript of the plea colloquy reveals that when asked whether he was being forced, threatened or coerced to plead guilty, defendant expressly answered \u201cNo.\u201d Although he now contends that Nix and certain of Nix\u2019s friends\u2014who were inside the jail with defendant\u2014pressured him to plead guilty so that Nix would be absolved, he admits that at no time prior to his plea did he mention any threats or coercion to his attorney, the District Attorney, the correction officers, or the court (see People v Hanley, 255 AD2d 837, 838 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 1050 [1999]). He claims that he kept silent because he believed no one could help him while he was confined in the jail; however, we note that he waited more than a year after his release before making this motion (see id.).\nAt the CPL article 440 hearing, defendant sought to admit tape recordings\u2014and partial transcripts thereof\u2014made by him of conversations he had with Nix and others after he was released from custody that purportedly prove his claims of duress. After initially reserving decision on the People\u2019s objections, County Court ultimately refused to admit that evidence. As the tapes were indisputably hearsay, were not authenticated (see People v Ely, 68 NY2d 520, 527-528 [1986]; People v Bell, 5 AD3d 858, 861 [2004]) and, in any event, the tape-recorded individuals were called to testify at the hearing, we find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.

In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), the evidence was legally sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).\nThe defendant failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Stultz, 2 NY3d 277, 279 [2004]; Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 687-694 [1984]).\nAlthough the period of time between the defendant\u2019s 1999 conviction and the commission of the felonies for which he stands convicted in this case was more than 10 years, the 1999 conviction constituted a predicate felony for purposes of second felony offender sentencing, since the 10-year statutory period was tolled while the defendant was incarcerated from May 5, 2000, to February 22, 2007 (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]; 70.70 [3] [b] [i]). The defendant\u2019s conclusory allegations were insufficient to support his contention that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained (see People v Penna, 47 AD3d 844 [2008]; People v Allen, 4 AD3d 479 [2004]; see also CPL 400.21 [7] [b]).\nThe sentence, although legally permissible, is excessive to the extent indicated herein (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). Dillon, J.E, Lott, Austin and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, resulting in a total of 20 years of imprisonment, which was initially ordered to run consecutively.

The record reflects that defendant was advised of the suspension of his driver\u2019s license at the sentencing hearing, prior to the imposition of the sentence. Defendant was thus provided an opportunity to challenge the voluntariness of his plea in this regard, but failed to do so. Accordingly, this issue is also unpreserved for our review (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182-183 [2013]; People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Garraway, 144 AD3d 703, 703 [2016]; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2013]). In any event, the suspension of his driver\u2019s license was a collateral consequence of defendant\u2019s guilty plea and the failure to disclose this consequence during the plea colloquy does not warrant vacatur of the plea (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 184-185; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]; People v Garraway, 144 AD3d at 703; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d at 1250).\nDefendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel survives his appeal waiver, insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacts the voluntariness of plea, but is also unpreserved for our review for lack of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1154-1155 [2017]; People v Macon, 142 AD3d 739, 739 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). To the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim involves matters outside of the record, it is more properly pursued in a motion pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]; People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 930 [2015]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony drug offender because County Court violated CPL 400.21 (3) by failing to give him an opportunity to contest the allegations contained in the prior felony information is unpreserved for our review as he failed to object at sentencing (see People v Shelmandine, 128 AD3d 1180, 1180-1181 [2015]; People v House, 119 AD3d 1289, 1290 [2014]). In any event, the record reflects that County Court substantially complied with the statutory requirements (see People v Shelmandine, 128 AD3d at 1181; People v Walton, 101 AD3d at 1490).\nLynch, Rose, Clark and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Greene County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced him to ten years in prison as a second felony drug offender. The defendant's appeal was largely precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, and his claims of involuntariness of the plea and ineffective assistance of counsel were deemed unpreserved for review due to procedural shortcomings. Additionally, the court found no merit in his arguments regarding the suspension of his driver's license and the sentencing process.</s>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMercure, J.P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered April 5, 2005, which resentenced defendant upon his conviction of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree.\nFollowing a juiy verdict finding defendant guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree, defendant was sentenced to the authorized maximum terms of incarceration of 25 years to life and 8V3 to 25 years, respectively, said terms to run consecutively. Upon defendant\u2019s appeal, the conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court (263 AD2d 874 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 799 [1999]). Pursuant to the provisions of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738), defendant came before County Court in 2005 for resentencing on the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. Authorized to impose a determinate sentence of at least eight years, and not exceeding 20 years (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.71 [2] [b] [i]), County Court resentenced defendant on that crime to a determinate term of 10 years (with five years of postrelease supervision), to run consecutively to the sentence previously imposed on the conspiracy conviction. Defendant appeals from the resentencing, contending that his sentence is excessive.\nOn defendant\u2019s appeal from the original judgment of conviction, we found that the aggregate sentence of 3373 years to life imprisonment was severe, but not excessive in the circumstances of this case (263 AD2d 874, 877 [1999], supra). We discern no reason to rule that the substantially reduced aggregate sentence of 1873 to 25 years after the resentencing is excessive. Although County Court imposed the maximum sentence at the initial sentencing, the term of 10 years to which defendant was resentenced upon the criminal sale count is close to the minimum authorized sentence, reflecting County Court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s favorable record while incarcerated. Nor are we persuaded that County Court abused its discretion in declining to alter defendant\u2019s sentences to run concurrently because the same sentences imposed upon his codefendant were imposed concurrently, inasmuch as defendant bore a higher level of culpability for the crimes of which the two were convicted (id. at 876; see People v Grajales, 294 AD2d 657, 659 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 697 [2002]; see also People v Provost, 25 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 817 [2006]; People v Purcell, 8 AD3d 821, 822 [2004]).\nCrew III, Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the resentencing of the defendant, who was originally convicted of first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and second-degree conspiracy, resulting in a new sentence of 10 years for the drug charge, to run consecutively with the existing conspiracy sentence. The court found that the reduced aggregate sentence was not excessive and noted that the sentencing judge considered the defendant's favorable incarceration record. Additionally, the court ruled that the decision not to impose concurrent sentences was justified due to the defendant's greater culpability compared to his co-defendant.</s>"}

He thereafter moved to withdraw his plea on the basis that it was not voluntarily entered. Specifically, defendant claimed that he was not provided sufficient opportunity to review discovery materials prior to deciding whether to plead guilty or go forward with pretrial suppression hearings and face revocation of the plea offer by the People. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and sentenced him in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to 4V2 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, contrary to the People\u2019s assertion, defendant\u2019s argument does concern the voluntariness of his plea and, as such, survives defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal. Moreover, the issue has been preserved for our review by defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Murray, 25 AD3d 911, 912 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 896 [2006]; People v Batcher, 291 AD2d 581, 582 [2002]).\nTurning to the merits, the plea minutes reveal that defendant, by his own assertions, had adequate time to consult with his attorney and was satisfied with his services, fully understood his rights and agreed to give them up and was not threatened or promised anything in exchange for his plea. Defendant then freely admitted the facts underlying the crime and pleaded guilty. Under these circumstances, County Court providently exercised its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea on the ground that it was voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Morris, 30 AD3d 632, 632 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]).\nPeters, Spain, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schoharie County (Lament, J.), rendered December 22, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of assault in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree in satisfaction of a multicount superior court information, waiving his right to appeal. When the plea was entered, County Court agreed to impose a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probationary supervision. The commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant\u2019s committing no Penal Law violations before the sentencing date. In the interim, however, defendant was arrested on a new charge. Defendant then agreed upon a disposition involving the new charge and a revised sentencing commitment on the assault charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the new charges, waiving his right to appeal, and was subsequently sentenced to negotiated concurrent terms of 1 to 3 years in prison on the assault conviction and 2 to 6 years on the drug charge. He now appeals, challenging the validity and severity of the sentences imposed.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s arguments, County Court did not err in imposing a more severe sentence on the assault charge upon defendant\u2019s breach of the conditional sentencing agreement (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718). County Court clearly indicated that its original sentence commitment was conditional and, in the event one of the conditions were breached, it would not be bound by its sentencing commitment but that defendant would still \u201cstand convicted\u201d. We note that at no time did defendant seek vacatur of his guilty plea on the assault charge or deny commission of the new offense, to which he also pleaded guilty. Thus, there is no merit to his contention that the court erred in not conducting a summary hearing (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713).\nFinally, even if defendant had not knowingly waived his right to appeal in the context of his guilty pleas (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032), we would nevertheless find his claim that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive to be without merit in light of his prior criminal history and the nature of the crimes.\nMercure, Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMcCarthy, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered March 19, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nDefendant was charged in a five-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and other drug-related crimes stemming from the sale of cocaine on three occasions. He was subsequently charged in a three-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and other crimes that followed a separate sale of cocaine and his conduct in resisting arrest. County Court consolidated the indictments and denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motions to suppress evidence. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and, under count two of the second indictment, to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, in satisfaction of that indictment, and admitted his predicate drug-related felony conviction. Consistent with the plea agreement, the court imposed concurrent prison sentences of six years with three years of postrelease supervision on each conviction. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel in that counsel failed to file an application requesting judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program pursuant to CPL 216.05. This claim is unpreserved for our review, as defendant failed to raise it before County Court and the record does not reflect that he moved to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Williams, 140 AD3d 1535, 1536 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 975 [2016]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d 1407, 1407 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). In any event, \u201cin the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1264 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). Here, defendant\u2019s assigned counsel opposed consolidation of the indictments, pursued discovery, made appropriate pretrial motions and competently represented him during the pretrial hearings and secured a favorable plea deal. Defendant then retained new counsel, who reviewed the case history and represented him at the time of the plea. Given that defendant could have received consecutive sentences on each of the four charged drug sales (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.25; People v Dean, 8 NY3d 929, 931 [2007]), and that the maximum second felony drug offender sentence for the top count to which he pleaded guilty, a class B felony, was 12 years (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]; [3] [b] [i]; 220.39 [1]), defendant benefitted from a favorable plea deal. Further, judicial diversion to drug treatment is discretionary (see People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2013]) and, even assuming that he is an \u201c[eligible defendant\u201d (CPL 216.00 [1]), the record does not reflect any basis upon which to believe that the court would have deemed it appropriate in view of defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history (see CPL 216.05 [3] [b] [v]; [4]; People v Pittman, 140 AD3d 989, 989 [2016]; People v Carper, 124 AD3d 1319, 1320 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 949 [2015]; compare People v Cora, 135 AD3d 987, 989 [2016]). Accordingly, were this claim properly before us, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation.\nFinally, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the agreed-upon sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Woodruff, 136 AD3d 1073, 1074 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Egan Jr., Rose and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nWhen defendant expressed that he was not happy with the plea offer, which had remained open for over six months, the People made clear that the offer would not change.

The defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the denial of judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program were deemed unpreserved for review, as he did not raise these issues before the lower court.

In satisfaction of such charges, she pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in the third degree. No sentencing commitment was made in connection with the plea, although County Court thoroughly explained to defendant the sentencing options available, including potential incarceration and restitution. County Court further explained that defendant would be required, as part of the plea, to waive her right to appeal everything except for the sentence. After defendant waived her right to appeal and County Court accepted her plea, it sentenced her to 180 days in jail, to be followed by five years\u2019 probation. County Court also imposed an order of protection and required defendant to pay restitution, together with a surcharge, of $511.41, a fine of $2,000, a mandatory felony conviction surcharge of $200 and a crime victim\u2019s assistance fee of $10.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. She takes particular issue with the amended condition of probation requiring the presence of an adult during any contact with an unrelated minor. Given the circumstances of the crime, which was committed in the presence of two young children and while defendant was on probation for violating a prior order of protection that had been issued in favor of the same victim, we find no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Wright, 233 AD2d 618 [1996]; see also People v Hale, 268 AD2d 691 [2000]).

Following a hearing, defendant\u2019s CPL article 440 motion was denied. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by leave of this Court, from the denial of his CPL article 440 motion.\nWe find unavailing defendant\u2019s claim that Judge LaBuda erred by not recusing himself from presiding over the instant case. Defendant concedes that there are no statutory grounds mandating disqualification {see Judiciary Law \u00a7 14) and, thus, Judge LaBuda was the sole arbiter as to whether he should have recused himself. That decision, in turn, will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion {see People v Saunders, 301 AD2d 869, 871 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]). Simply put, disqualification is not required where a judge has represented a defendant on a prior criminal case {see People v Marrero, 30 AD3d 637, 638 [2006]) and where that case constitutes the predicate for enhanced sentencing (cfi People v Jones, 143 AD2d 465, 467 [1988]) if, as here, there is no evidence of bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge.

As a part of the plea agreement, County Court agreed to sentence defendant to concurrent prison terms of 2% to 7 years on the burglary conviction and 4 to 12 years on each of the two attempted sale convictions. Defendant also expressly agreed that County Court would be free to impose the harshest sentences, all to be served consecutively, if defendant intentionally failed to appear for sentencing. Defendant subsequently failed to appear for sentencing, allegedly because he had become intoxicated, and County Court imposed two consecutive sentences of 4 to 12 years for the attempted sale convictions and a sentence of 2Vz to 7 years for the burglary conviction, to run concurrently to the other two sentences.\nGiven the voluntary nature of defendant\u2019s intoxication, we find that the record demonstrates that defendant intentionally failed to appear for sentencing. Consequently, County Court was free to enhance the sentence in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement (see, People v Bennett, 162 AD2d 825; People v Chevalier, 92 AD2d 944). Further, in light of defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record and the facts that he was allowed to plead guilty to three crimes in satisfaction of three indictments that included a total of 16 counts and was not given the harshest sentences possible on the convictions of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, we find no basis to disturb the sentence of County Court. Finally, County Court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the sentence without a hearing.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMcCarthy, J.\nIn satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence of 2V2 years in prison followed by a term of postrelease supervision between IV2 and 3 years. At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that he was not guilty and that his plea was not knowingly and intelligently made. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to 2V2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. The decision whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and a hearing is only required when the circumstances present a genuine question about the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Moreno, 86 AD3d 863, 864 [2011]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2011]). Here, the record reveals that defendant was fully advised about the consequences of his plea, had the opportunity to discuss the matter with his attorney, understood the repercussions, and voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the commission of the crime. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s application without a hearing based upon his unsubstantiated claims of innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel (see People v Moreno, 86 AD3d at 864-865; People v Herringshaw, 83 AD3d 1133, 1133-1134 [2011]).\nDefendant next contends that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender, however, that claim is unpreserved for our review by virtue of his failure to make an objection at sentencing (see People v Califano, 84 AD3d 1504, 1506 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 805 [2011]; People v Berry, 78 AD3d 1226, 1228 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 828 [2011]).

He executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant contends that his guilty plea was not voluntarily made and the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive.\nInitially, we note that, while defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives a waiver of his right to appeal, his failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment renders it unpreserved for our review (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662). In any event, the transcript of the plea proceedings demonstrates that County Court fully explained the rights being surrendered by his guilty plea and defendant acknowledged the relinquishment of those rights. He stated that his mind was clear and he had not consumed any alcohol or taken medication. At that same time, defendant also indicated that he was not being coerced to enter the plea and had, in fact, sold cocaine. Accordingly, were we to reach the merits, we would find that defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814; People v Richardson, 295 AD2d 763, 764).\nFurthermore, since defendant waived his right to appeal as part of his guilty plea, his assertion that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive is also unpreserved for our review (see People v Wyche, 289 AD2d 870, 870; People v Church, 287 AD2d 788, 788-789, lv denied 97 NY2d 680). Nevertheless, were the merits before us, given defendant\u2019s past involvement in drug activity, the fact that the agreed-upon sentence was the result of a beneficial plea bargain and the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of judicial discretion, we would find a modification in the sentence is not warranted (see People v Bell, 290 AD2d 729, 730; People v David, 263 AD2d 615, 615).\nMercure, Peters, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

She was arraigned on October 15, 1991 and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. On December 11, 1991, defendant was present in County Court for the apparent purpose of changing her plea to guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the entire indictment, with the understanding that she would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. During this plea proceeding defendant requested an adjournment of one week to give her more time to think about the plea. County Court denied her request and, after conferring with her attorney, conducted the plea allocution and accepted her guilty plea.\nAt her sentencing on January 8, 1992 defendant, through her counsel, requested permission to withdraw her plea of. guilty on various grounds including ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court then gave defendant an opportunity to speak and defendant said that she felt that she was not told \"a lot of my rights\u201d by her attorney \"so that\u2019s one reason why I\u2019m withdrawing my plea. Also, my co-defendant got lesser time than I got. And I was not guilty in this case. And I\u2019m not guilty\u201d. The court interrupted, reminding defendant of her plea, and defendant replied that she felt that she was pressured because she was told by the court that day that if she did not accept the plea offer the trial would start immediately. After further discussion County Court found that although defendant was unhappy with what had occurred, her unhappiness was not a ground for withdrawal of the plea and denied the motion. County Court then imposed sentence despite defendant\u2019s protestations. This appeal ensued.\nThe indictment followed the stopping of defendant at about 1:00 a.m. on August 28, 1991 when she was driving a rented automobile with two passengers on the Thruway at an alleged 80 miles per hour. A State Trooper found some narcotics and arrested one passenger for possession of narcotics. Another Trooper, upon executing a consensual search, found a paper bag purportedly containing a controlled substance, later claimed to be cocaine, in the rear passenger area. All three of the vehicle\u2019s occupants were then arrested.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that she did not understand that she was waiving her right to appeal at the plea proceeding, and therefore she did not make a knowing, intelligent, voluntary and enforceable waiver of her right to appeal, is rejected (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039, 1040). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\nDefense counsel stated in open court that he had explained to defendant certain things involved in the plea agreement, including that \"she would be waiving her right to trial and all the rights attached thereto * * * and additionally she would have to forego any motions she could have made in this case and forego her right to appeal process\u201d. In the plea allocution County Court asked defendant whether, \"[i]n consideration of this negotiated plea and sentence do you * * * waive your right to any hearings, trials, appeals or other proceedings in this matter\u201d, and she answered in the affirmative. The record does not support the assertion that she was confused concerning the waiver of her right to appeal. Defendant\u2019s criminal record indicates that she was not a stranger to criminal proceedings but, rather, was familiar with the plea-bargaining process. Defendant, by her waiver of her right to appeal, has waived any alleged deficiencies in the plea proceedings (see, People v Brown, supra, at 1040).\nYesawich Jr., Levine and Crew III, JJ., concur.

Under the unusually compelling circumstances of this case, we believe that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of our discretion in the interest of justice.\nDefendant and his sister (People v Luann R., 119 AD2d 992) became involved with drugs when their mother invited the son of a close friend into their home in a misguided attempt to change his drug-related life-style through the good influence of her children. Unfortunately, the influence was in the opposite direction, ultimately resulting in the conviction of both of her children for the sale of controlled substances.\nThe events underlying the convictions herein took place over a period of several months when defendant was 17 to 18 years old, his sister 21. Neither had been in any trouble before; indeed, both were very industrious and had held jobs while attending school. Defendant became addicted to cocaine and acted as a courier in order to support his own drug needs. After his arrest, defendant entered a drug detoxification program, purged himself of his addiction and obtained a responsible position.

The People declared their readiness for trial in open court on September 23, 1998, and the matter proceeded to trial before County Court. On May 26, 1999, following jury selection, opening statements by counsel and the partial testimony of a police officer, County Court (Bruhn, J.) sua sponte declared a mistrial with the consent of the parties after determining that the trial would take longer than the time originally allotted and interfere with the ability to maintain a jury of 12 persons. Although the People have consistently maintained that they did not object to the court\u2019s suggestion that a new trial be scheduled to commence in September 1999 and that they remained ready for trial following the declaration of the mistrial, they did not expressly communicate their readiness to proceed on the record in open court or by written notice to defense counsel and the court.\nThe case was transferred to Supreme Court, Ulster County, and a new trial commenced on January 31, 2000. Following a hearing, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds was denied. A second trial was held, at the close of which defendant was convicted on all counts and sentenced to, inter alia, six years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals, arguing, among other things, that Supreme Court erred in denying his CPL 30.30 motion to dismiss the indictment.\nWhen a defendant is accused of a felony, the People have six months from \u201cthe commencement of [the] criminal action\u201d to declare their readiness (CPL 30.30 [1] [a]). CPL 30.30 (5) (a) provides that \u201cwhere the defendant is to be * * * retried following a mistrial, * * * the criminal action * * * must be deemed to have commenced on the date the * * * order occasioning a retrial becomes final.\u201d Accordingly, once County Court declared a mistrial upon its own motion on May 26, 1999, the People had until November 26, 1999 to declare themselves \u201cready for trial.\u201d While the People assert that they remained ready to proceed, they failed to declare readiness either in open court or by written notice sent to both defense counsel and the appropriate court clerk following the declaration of the mistrial. Therefore, they were not \u201cready for trial\u201d within the meaning of the statute (see People v Chavis, 91 NY2d 500, 505).\nThe People argue that their CPL 30.30 responsibilities were satisfied by their initial, pre-mistrial declaration. This argument is contrary to the literal language of the statute, which clearly provides that the criminal action is deemed to have recommenced, thus triggering the speedy trial clock, when a mistrial is declared and a new trial is ordered (see People v Delacruz, 241 AD2d 328, 328, lv denied 90 NY2d 939; People v Weaver, 162 AD2d 486, 487, lv denied 76 NY2d 868; People v Fudger, 70 AD2d 703, 703; cf. People v Cortes, 80 NY2d 201, 214-215; People v Tamulewicz, 88 AD2d 698). Inasmuch as the People make no further attempt to show, and the record does not indicate, that any time periods should be excluded under CPL 30.30 (4), the indictment should be dismissed (see People v Chavis, supra at 504-505). In light of our determination, it is unnecessary to consider defendant\u2019s alternative arguments in favor of reversal.\nPeters, Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

[/INST] The appellate court reversed the Supreme Court's judgment convicting the defendant on multiple drug-related charges, ruling that the prosecution failed to declare readiness for trial within the statutory timeframe following a mistrial.

As defendant\u2019s understanding of the waiver is not \u201cevident on the face of the record,\u201d it is not valid (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256).\nDefendant\u2019s argument that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh or excessive is properly before us as a result (see id. at 255-256); nevertheless, we reject it. The record reflects that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted only after two psychiatrists conducted CPL article 730 examinations, concluding that he was not incapacitated. In agreeing to a sentence that greatly reduced defendant\u2019s potential sentencing exposure under the indictment, County Court took into consideration his mental health and substance abuse problems (see People v Eggsware, 90 AD3d 1231, 1234 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 923 [2012]). Given defendant\u2019s serious criminal history, we do not find that the sentence imposed constituted an abuse of discretion or that extraordinary circumstances are present so as to warrant a reduction in the sentence (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Crump, 107 AD3d 1046, 1047 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1014 [2013]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMain, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Scheinman, J.), rendered March 2, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant contends that his judgment of conviction should be reversed and the indictment against him dismissed because the actual currency that passed from a police informant to defendant in exchange for a quantity of cocaine was not preserved for trial. This argument lacks merit. We note first that a defendant can be found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance even where no money has been given to him in exchange for the substance, since Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 (1) defines such a sale as including, inter alia, an exchange or gift. Thus, strictly speaking, it was not necessary for the People to introduce into evidence the money used in the transaction in order to convict defendant. Moreover, the People here did introduce into evidence photocopies of the money in question as well as testimony regarding the possession by defendant of that very currency following the transaction.\nWe likewise reject defendant\u2019s contention that the prison sentence imposed upon him of 4 to 12 years was harsh and excessive. The sentence was within the statutory limits and there is no evidence that the sentencing court abused its discretion (see, People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976, 977). We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be lacking in merit.\nJudgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Casey, Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur. [/INST] The County Court of Sullivan County affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance, rejecting his argument that the lack of preserved currency from the drug transaction warranted dismissal of the indictment.

The 4 to 12-year prison sentence was deemed appropriate and within statutory limits, with no abuse of discretion by the sentencing court.</s>"}

As so modified, judgment under indictment No. 2958/83 affirmed.\nJudgments under indictments Nos. 7400/83 and 3306/83 affirmed.\nDefendant entered into a plea bargain agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty to certain crimes under three separate indictments (indictments Nos. 2958/83, 7400/83 and 3306/83) and in satisfaction of a pending Criminal Court case. It is clear from the plea minutes that it was agreed that under indictment No. 2958/83 \u2014 the top count of which was criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, an A-I felony \u2014 defendant would plead guilty to an A-II felony. Further, in accordance with that agreement, the court promised to sentence defendant to a term of six years to life imprisonment, such sentence being the minimum permissible sentence upon a conviction of an A-II felony as a second felony offender (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [4] [a]). In entering his plea under indictment No. 2958/83, however, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.21). Thereafter, at sentencing, the court imposed a sentence of six years to life upon such conviction in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.\nWe now modify that conviction, in the interest of justice and upon the request of the People, by reducing it to one of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, an A-II felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement. Further, since the sentence imposed upon defendant\u2019s conviction under indictment No. 2958/83 of six years to life was the sentence promised and is the minimum permissible sentence which could be imposed upon defendant\u2019s conviction, as a second felony offender, of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, there is no purpose to be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.\nWe have examined the issues raised by defendant in his brief and find them to be either unpreserved or without merit (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816). Brown, J. P., Rubin, Lawrence and Kooper, JJ., concur.

Thereafter in a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10, defendant sought to vacate this judgment of conviction upon the basis that the People failed to fulfill the terms of the plea bargain. Defendant argued before County Court, and contends on this appeal, that the District Attorney agreed to recommend to the court a more favorable sentence in return for meaningful cooperation on his part.\nThe threshold issue requires a determination of the plea bargain. At defense counsel\u2019s request and with the consent of the prosecution, defendant and the court, counsel was permit ted to place the plea agreement on the record, stating \"that it [was] necessary to dictate a complete understanding of the terms and conditions before we proceed to effectuate it\u201d. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s attorney invited immediate interruption if anything he stated was not in conformance with the agreement. With that background, counsel dictated the following relevant portion of the agreement: \"Now, [the District Attorney] has made no commitment or assemblance [sic] of a commitment; but between the time of the plea and the time of the sentence, he would be receptive to meaningful cooperation and upon which, in his sole discretion, he may make other recommendations at some other time.\u201d\nDefendant argues that his August 24, 1987 letter sent to the District Attorney entitled him to a lesser sentence. We disagree. While defendant is entitled to specific performance of a plea bargain agreement (People v Auslander, supra), it is clear that the agreement in this case does not provide for a required lesser sentence. Because the crux of defendant\u2019s motion is the existence of an unfulfilled promise, the motion must fail because it is clear that no agreement was reached. Accordingly, the motion was properly denied without a hearing (see, CPL 440.30 [4]; People v Crimmins, 38 NY2d 407, 418), and it was not necessary to determine whether the subject letter, sent prior to the time defendant absconded while on bail prior to sentencing, constituted meaningful cooperation. The orders denying defendant\u2019s motions for reargument are not appeal-able.\nOrder entered December 13, 1989 affirmed.\nAppeals from orders entered January 8, 1990 and February 1, 1990 dismissed. Mahoney, P. J., Weiss, Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., and Levine, JJ., concur. [/INST] The court affirmed the denial of the defendant's motion to vacate his conviction for two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance, ruling that there was no unfulfilled promise in the plea agreement regarding a lesser sentence, as it lacked a binding commitment from the District Attorney.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nDevine, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Koweek, J.), rendered June 24, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (nine counts) and resisting arrest, and the violation of unlawful possession of marihuana.\nDefendant was charged, in three indictments, with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (nine counts), resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marihuana. Following an unsuccessful suppression motion, he pleaded guilty as charged and waived his right to appeal. He did so upon the understanding that his guilty plea would satisfy other pending charges and that, regardless of the outcome of a dispute as to whether his prior conviction for a federal drug offense rendered him a second felony offender, there would be a joint recommendation to sentence him to no more than 7V2 years in prison and a period of postrelease supervision. Defendant acknowledged at sentencing that he had previously been convicted of a predicate felony, and County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we find that defendant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal. Defendant executed a written plea agreement for each indictment that explained his right to appeal and waived it aside from a challenge to \u201cthe sentence . . . should it be harsher than the sentence that the District Attorney and [defendant] negotiated and jointly recommended.\u201d During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged that he had read those documents and had sufficient time to discuss them with defense counsel. County Court then \u201cadequately described [the right to appeal] without lumping it into the panoply of rights normally forfeited upon a guilty plea\u201d and confirmed that defendant understood his decision to waive it except as described in the written plea agreements (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341 [2015]). The record accordingly establishes that defendant\u2019s appeal waivers were valid (see id.; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1332-1333 [2016], lv denied 29 NY3d 1001 [Apr. 6, 2017]). The valid appeal waivers, in turn, preclude his challenges to the denial of his suppression motion (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d at 342; People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]) and the severity of his sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255).\nDefendant\u2019s further attack upon the procedures employed to determine his predicate felony status survives his appeal waivers (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]), but is unpreserved due to his failure to object to that procedure before County Court (see People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]; People v Gathers, 106 AD3d 1333, 1333-1334 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1073 [2013]). In any event, defendant pleaded guilty knowing full well that the question of whether he would be sentenced as a second felony offender remained unresolved. The People did not file a predicate felony statement in a timely manner, but did hand one up at sentencing stating that defendant had previously been convicted of a federal drug offense constituting a felony under New York law (see CPL 400.21 [2]). Defense counsel then stated on the record that he had advised defendant that the federal conviction amounted to a prior felony conviction and that there was \u201cnothing to challenge,\u201d at which point defendant admitted under oath that the allegations in the statement were accurate. Under these circumstances, \u201c[t]he People\u2019s failure to file a predicate statement [until after sentencing] was harmless, and remanding for filing and resentencing would be futile and pointless\u201d (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 20 [1983]; People v Gathers, 106 AD3d at 1334; People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]).\nAs a final matter, a few of our prior cases have noted that \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with CPL 400.21 is sufficient to uphold sentencing a defendant as a second felony offender (People v Pierre, 8 AD3d 904, 906 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]), but that a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d to file a predicate statement will \u201crender [ ] the sentence invalid as a matter of law\u201d (id. at 907; see People v De Fayette, 16 AD3d 708, 710 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Our reading of those cases is that they stand for the proposition that a significant failure to comply with the procedures of CPL 400.21, absent circumstances showing the error to be harmless, will be fatal to the ensuing sentence (see e.g. People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d at 1142; People v Harris, 61 NY2d at 20). We do not read them as hold ing that the failure to timely file a predicate statement is inexorably fatal to the validity of the ensuing sentence and, to the extent that reading is possible, we do not countenance it.\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Mulvey and Aarons, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal concerns a conviction in Columbia County for multiple drug-related offenses and resisting arrest, following the defendant's guilty plea. The court found that the defendant knowingly waived his right to appeal as part of his plea agreement, which included a joint recommendation for a maximum prison sentence of 7.5 years. Although the defendant challenged the procedures regarding his prior felony status, the court ruled that the failure to file a predicate felony statement in a timely manner was harmless, affirming the conviction and sentence.</s>"}

On appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in accepting his plea of guilty inasmuch as the described facts raised a possible agency defense. Notably, this argument is not preserved for our review since defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Nevertheless, defendant argues that this record establishes the exception to the preservation rule which applies \u201c[i]n the rare instance where \u2018the defendant\u2019s recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon the defendant\u2019s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea\u2019 \u201d (People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006, quoting People v Lopez, supra at 666). However, this exception will be invoked only when the trial court fails to probe further to ensure that the defendant\u2019s plea is voluntary and the defendant understands the nature of the plea (see, People v Lopez, supra at 666).\nHere, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, County Court conducted an inquiry into the benefit defendant received from participating in the sale and elicited sufficient facts supporting the conclusion that defendant acted with an \u201cindependent desire or inclination to promote the transaction\u201d (People v Argibay, 45 NY2d 45, 54). Because County Court fulfilled its duty in this regard, defendant may not challenge the sufficiency of his plea on direct appeal (see, People v Lopez, supra at 666; People v Saitch, supra at 725).\nFurthermore, we do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see, NY Const, art 1, \u00a7 6; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Defense counsel\u2019s purported failure to effectuate defendant\u2019s right to testify before the grand jury does not, per se, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872, 873) particularly where, as here, \u201cdefendant has failed to demonstrate the necessary absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel\u2019s actions\u201d (People v Richardson, 193 AD2d 969, 971, lv denied 82 NY2d 725; see, People v Brown, 232 AD2d 750, 752). Additionally, \u201c[t]he mere fact that different attorneys assisted in the defendant\u2019s case at different times does not render their assistance ineffective\u201d (People v Hayes, 186 AD2d 268, 269). In any event, County Court appropriately inquired into defendant\u2019s various general criticisms of counsel, as well as his speculative allegations of conflict of interest (see, People v Smith, 271 AD2d 752; People v Thornton, 167 AD2d 935, lv denied 78 NY2d 1082), and we find no reason to disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the complaints were unsupported in the record.\nCrew III, Spain, Carpinello and Rose, JJ., concur.

Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, based upon our review of the plea colloquy and in consideration of his counseled written waiver of appeal, defendant was adequately informed that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea such that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v O\u2019Keefe, 133 AD3d 1034, 1034-1035 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1148 [2016]; People v Oginski, 123 AD3d 1303, 1303 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 970 [2015]).

In accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to IV2 years in prison, imposed a $1,000 fine and ordered restitution in the amount of $10.\nDefendant asserts that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because County Court failed to adequately explore his potential intoxication defense. While such a claim remains reviewable despite defendant\u2019s guilty plea and appeal waiver, the record reveals that County Court satisfied its duty to inquire further (see People v Carter, 62 AD3d 1154, 1154-1155 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009]; People v Sterling, 57 AD3d 1110, 1112 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 788 [2009]). Indeed, after defendant stated that his behavior was unintentional because he was intoxicated when he sold the controlled substance, County Court immediately informed defendant that the crime to which he was pleading guilty required criminal intent, advised him of the possible intoxication defense and asked him whether he was voluntarily waiving such a defense. Defendant acknowledged that he was and stated that he had discussed the matter with his attorney. Accordingly, County Court properly accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea only after ensuring that defendant\u2019s waiver of the potential intoxication defense was knowing and voluntary (see People v Munck, 278 AD2d 662, 662-663 [2000]).\nWe also note that, \u201csince defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged in the indictment, a factual basis for the plea was unnecessary\u201d (People v Moore, 71 NY2d 1002, 1006 [1988]).

Finally, as the record reveals that the fine and restitution were part of defendant\u2019s plea agreement, County Court did not impose an enhanced sentence and there is no basis to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea (compare People v McCarthy, 56 AD3d 904, 905 [2008]).\nPeters, J.P., Rose, Lahtinen and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

Defendant\u2019s sole contention on this appeal is that pursuant to People v Ryan (82 NY2d 497), his plea should be vacated on the grounds that the prosecution was not able to demonstrate his actual knowledge of the quantity of the controlled substance and that the Ryan holding should be applied retroactively.\nAlthough the Court of Appeals has since determined that the Ryan decision (supra) would be retroactive to cases pending on direct appeal at the time of the Ryan decision on December 16, 1993, the Court further held that the issue of proof of defendant\u2019s knowledge as to both possession and weight of the controlled substance must be fully preserved for appellate review (see, People v Hill, 85 NY2d 256). In People v Gray (86 NY2d 10), the Court of Appeals again emphasized that this issue must be fully preserved by a defendant (see, People v Harrell, 86 NY2d 806).\nIn the instant case there was no such preservation and the record discloses that at the time of the plea allocution defendant answered in the affirmative when asked by County Court if he knowingly and unlawfully possessed one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances of an aggregate weight of two ounces or more containing a narcotic drug. In addition, as part of the plea bargain defendant waived his right to appeal and has not moved to vacate the plea. Although a guilty plea does not preclude the right to raise certain jurisdictional or constitutional defects, it generally removes the issue of factual guilt from the case where the claim relates to the factual elements of the crime charged (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1). In the instant case, as in People v Ryan (supra), where a question of statutory interpretation is involved, by pleading to a lesser crime defendant determined that he would not litigate the question of guilt and surrendered certain rights, including the right to challenge the factual basis for the plea, even in a postconviction motion (see, People v Hereida, 187 AD2d 272, Iv denied 81 NY2d 841; People v Hadden, 158 AD2d 856; People v Armer, 119 AD2d 930). Further, where the purported failure to require defendant to allocute all the elements of the crime appears on the record, the sufficiency of the plea allocution can be reviewed only by direct appeal and cannot be attacked in a CPL 440.10 proceeding and used as a substitute for direct appeal (see, People v Cooks, 67 NY2d 100).\nThus, this plea should not be subjected to collateral attack and we affirm the order of County Court denying defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion.\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed. [/INST] The County Court of Greene County denied the defendant's CPL 440.10 motion to vacate his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which he had pleaded guilty to as part of a plea bargain. The appellate court affirmed the denial, indicating that the defendant did not preserve the issue of his knowledge regarding the controlled substance's quantity for appellate review, and that his guilty plea waived his right to challenge the factual basis of the plea. Thus, the court concluded that the plea could not be attacked through a post-conviction motion.</s>"}

The Supreme Court properly denied the request to charge duress on the ground that the defendant had only testified to some implied threats. The entrapment defense was charged. Although defense counsel neither requested an agency charge nor objected to the court\u2019s failure to so charge, the defendant asks that we now exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction and remit this case for a new trial for failure to charge the agency defense (see, CPL 470.15 [3] [c]; [6] [a]). Under the circumstances of this case, we decline to so exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction (cf., People v Oliver, 99 AD2d 789). Had an agency charge been requested, the facts in this case would have warranted the giving of such a charge (see, People v Roche, 45 NY2d 78, cert denied 439 US 958; but see, People v Herring, 83 NY2d 780).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered July 12, 1977, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of eight and one-third years to life. Defendant was convicted upon a charge of selling heroin to one George Cesario, Jr., a police informant, on the 19th day of November, 1976 at approximately 8:00 a.m. On this appeal defendant urges that it was reversible error for the trial court to deny his motion for an order dismissing the indictment on the ground that the prosecution was barred by reason of a previous conviction for a different sale to the same informant. A previous indictment, which also resulted in a conviction, alleged that the defendant on or about the 17th day of November, 1976, at approximately 8:08 a.m., sold heroin to one George Cesario, Jr., the police informant. The two sales to the same person at the same place were 48 hours apart. As such, they constituted separate and distinct offenses (People v Paul, 37 NY2d 100). The separate offenses were not so closely related or connected in point of time and circumstance as to constitute a single criminal incident and, thus, CPL 40.20 (subd 2) is inapplicable. On the conviction for the first sale, the trial court imposed a sentence of seven years to life and on the second conviction for the second sale, some 48 hours later to the same informant, the tri\u00e1l court imposed a sentence of eight and one-third years to life. Discretion in the imposition of sentence rests with the trial court and should not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion (People v Thiel, 25 NY2d 926; People v West, 52 AD2d 968). The sentence imposed was legally permissible and on such facts we find no abuse of discretion. The defendant\u2019s remaining contention is that the District Attorney\u2019s summation was so prejudicial, improper and inflammatory as to require a reversal. We have examined the record herein and find that contention to be without merit, especially in view of the trial court\u2019s prompt and proper ruling in that regard. Judgment affirmed. Sweeney, J. P., Staley, Jr., Main, Larkin and Mikoll, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed his conviction for selling heroin to a police informant, arguing that the trial court erred by not dismissing the indictment due to a previous conviction for a similar offense involving the same informant.

The appeal was affirmed, with the court finding no abuse of discretion in sentencing or merit in the defendant's claims regarding prosecutorial misconduct.</s>"}

In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to five years of probation. He was subsequently charged with violating certain conditions of his probation and admitted to the probation violations, again waiving his right to appeal. Thereafter, County Court revoked his probation and resentenced him as a second felony drug offender to 10 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends, among other things, that the resentence is invalid because a predicate felony statement was not filed in accordance with CPL 400.21 (2) before he was sentenced as a second felony drug offender. Although this claim has not been preserved for our review due to defendant\u2019s failure to make an appropriate motion (see People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]), under the particular circumstances presented, we exercise our discretion in the interest of justice to take corrective action (see People v Loper, 118 AD3d 1394, 1395 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1204 [2015]; People v Kimmons, 39 AD3d 1180, 1181 [2007]). The People concede and the record reveals that a predicate felony statement was never filed as is required by CPL 400.21 (2). In addition, there is no indication that defendant had notice that he would be sentenced as a second felony drug offender when he admitted to the probation violations or at resentencing. Consequently, defendant did not have an opportunity to contest his prior convictions. In view of this, the resentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing (see People v Fields, 79 AD3d 1448, 1449 [2010]; People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]; People v Mosley, 54 AD3d 1098, 1099 [2008]; People v Anthony, 52 AD3d 864, 865 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 733 [2008]; People v Ruddy, 51 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 787 [2009]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr., Mulvey, Aarons and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nWe note that, inasmuch as this claim implicates the legality of the resentence, it is not precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Fields, 79 AD3d 1448, 1449 [2010]; People v Mosley, 54 AD3d 1098, 1099 [2008]). [/INST] The appellate court reviewed a case where the defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison as a second felony drug offender.

He was sentenced, pursuant to the plea agreement, to a term of imprisonment of three years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.\nInasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea and his claim that his sentence was improperly limited are not preserved for our review (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], Iv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]).

At a subsequent appearance before County Court (Drago, J.), and in full satisfaction of both the superior court information and other pending drug-related charges, defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to the charged crime. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court (Loyola, J.) thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to four years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues on appeal that County Court (Drago, J.) failed to adequately explore defendant\u2019s stated mental health issues (depression, anxiety and a sleep disorder) and erred in accepting his plea without first conducting a competency hearing.

Here, a review of the plea colloquy confirms that defendant responded appropriately to County Court\u2019s inquiries, indicated that he understood the nature of the proceedings and assured the court that he wished to proceed (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]; People v Bennett, 30 AD3d at 631; People v Mears, 16 AD3d 917, 918 [2005]).

To the extent that defendant\u2019s related ineffective assistance of counsel claim implicates the voluntariness of his plea and, therefore, survives the appeal waiver, this issue is similarly unpreserved for our review (see People v Baxter, 154 AD3d 1010, 1011 [2017]; People v Williams, 150 AD3d 1549, 1551 [2017]; People v Borden, 91 AD3d at 1125-1126).

In any event, defendant\u2019s claims are without merit. During the plea colloquy, defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to speak with his attorney and was satisfied with his services. He also acknowledged that he understood his rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty and freely admitted the facts underlying the crime. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant entered his plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see People v Means, 35 AD3d 975, 976 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 948 [2007]) and, noting the favorable plea agreement which reduced his sentence exposure, received meaningful representation (see People v Lewis, 39 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2007]).\nFinally, we have considered defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive, yet find it to be unavailing. Nothing in the record convinces us that Supreme Court abused its discretion nor are there any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the negotiated sentence (see People v Qasem, 39 AD3d 960, 961 [2007]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Crew III and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nIt is hereby ordered that the case is held, the decision is reserved and the matter is remitted to Onondaga County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of burglary in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.20). Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, entered into in January 2007, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of burglary, a class D felony, and was promised that, if he successfully completed a drug treatment program, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea to the felony and instead plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a promised sentence of a one-year conditional discharge. If defendant was unsuccessful in the drug treatment program, however, under the plea agreement he would be sentenced to a term of incarceration of one to three years. The record establishes that the drug treatment contract included a provision that, in order to remain enrolled in the program, defendant could not be arrested. In January 2008, defendant appeared in County Court for sentencing on the felony based upon his termination from the drug treatment program for, inter alia, his postplea arrests for other crimes. Defendant denied having been criminally involved in the crimes giving rise to his arrests and requested an opportunity to prove his innocence. Relying heavily upon the \u201cmere fact\u201d of defendant\u2019s arrests (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]), the court summarily sentenced defendant to one to three years.\nInitially, we agree with defendant that, even if valid, his waiver of the right to appeal does not encompass his contention that the court erred in failing to conduct an inquiry to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for defendant\u2019s termination from the drug treatment program (see People v Huggins, 45 AD3d 1380 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1006 [2007]; see also People v Fiammegta, 14 NY3d 90 [2010]). We further agree with defendant that the court erred in failing to \u201ccarry out an inquiry of sufficient depth to satisfy itself that there was a legitimate basis\u201d for defendant\u2019s termination from the drug treatment program (Fiammegta, 14 NY3d at 98), including whether the postplea arrests were \u201cwithout foundation\u201d (Outley, 80 NY2d at 713). Because defendant served his sentence of incarceration, the only remedy available to him is to be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty to a felony and to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. We therefore hold the case, reserve decision, and remit the matter to County Court to conduct an inquiry to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for defendant\u2019s termination from the drug treatment program, including whether defendant\u2019s postplea arrests were without foundation.

By fleeing to Brazil, defendant failed to honor his part of the bargain to assist the police in their drug investigations.

In any event, the court had clearly conditioned the promised sentence upon, inter alla, the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the Probation Department. The defendant failed to fulfill that condition and the proffered explanation for such failure was vague, unsubstantiated and insufficient (see, People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917).\nWe find that the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. A review of the record shows that acceptance of the plea offer greatly reduced the defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure. In advising the defendant to accept that offer, her attorney afforded her meaningful representation and thereby satisfied the constitutional requirements (see, People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705; People v Saggese, 135 AD2d 669, 670; People v Hidalgo, 120 AD2d 675). Defense counsel\u2019s failure to move to withdraw the defendant\u2019s plea or to object to the enhanced sentence cannot be characterized as ineffective assistance of counsel since vacatur of the plea would have exposed the defendant to a substantially greater period of incarceration if she were convicted under the original charges.

Based upon defendant\u2019s admission at the plea colloquy and the information contained in the presentence report that she had a prior felony conviction, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3 to 6 years, executed as a sentence of parole supervision. Defendant contends that her sentence is illegal in that she was erroneously sentenced as a second felony offender because at the time the instant sentence was imposed she was awaiting resentencing for the prior felony conviction due to her parole having been revoked. Although defendant waived her right to appeal as part of her plea agreement, she is not precluded from challenging the legality of her sentence (see, People v Laureano, 87 NY2d 640, 643).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMain, J.\nAppeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), entered March 8,1984, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and his conviction was affirmed by this court without opinion (105 AD2d 594). On this motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 (1) (h), defendant contends that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily but resulted from coercion and the denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel. The basis for this claim is defendant\u2019s contention that his then assigned attorney advised him that no one had been acquitted of drug charges in Albany County, that he would receive a sentence of 25 years to life if convicted after trial, that even if acquitted, the District Attorney would seek to indict him on another drug charge, and that he had to decide immediately whether to accept a plea agreement. These facts are supported by sworn allegations, upon information and belief, by defendant\u2019s current attorney, who further states the sources of his information and the grounds of his belief (see, CPL 440.30 [1]). Upon such a record, we are of the view that a hearing should have been held to determine the validity of these allegations (CPL 440.30 [5]; see, People v Picciotti, 4 NY2d 340).\nThis result is not precluded by defendant having raised a similar claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the direct appeal following his conviction. Ineffective assistant of counsel can usually be determined only after an evidentiary exploration under a CPL 440.10 motion and it is the rare occasion when such a claim can be resolved on direct appeal (see, e.g., People v Brown, 45 NY2d 852, 853-854). Under such circumstances, a rejection on direct appeal of a claim of ineffective assistance grounded on matters not appearing in the record should not prevent consideration on the merits of a later CPL 440.10 motion on similar grounds (see, e.g., People v Boans, 93 AD2d 1000), provided that the statutory requirements (CPL 440.30) are satisfied, as they are in this case.\nOrder reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.

Defendant also submitted a pro se brief wherein he argues that the People failed to comply with County Court\u2019s order regarding Rosario material, that County Court failed to charge that accomplice testimony must be independently corroborated, and that the sentence was harsh and excessive.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals in People v Marcerola (47 NY2d 257, 263) stated: \"While a defendant may choose to retain his attorney^ ] such choice may be made only after the defendant is informed of the possible ramifications which joint representation might spawn when conflicting interests arguably exist. Only after sufficient admonition by the trial court of the potential pitfalls of joint representation can it be said that a defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is adequately safeguarded. If such admonition does appear on the record, appellate courts are able to determine whether a defendant\u2019s decision to retain his attorney is indeed an informed choice\u201d (footnote omitted). Here, the record clearly reveals that County Court closely examined defendant to ascertain if he was aware of the potential risks involved in joint representation and that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently chose to proceed with simultaneous representation of himself and his brother. Under such circumstances, there was no denial of defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel.\nTurning to the arguments raised in defendant\u2019s pro se brief, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the People failed to comply with County Court\u2019s order to turn over all Rosario material for inspection by defendant, particularly a written report entitled DEA 6. The cross-examination by defense counsel of Special Agent Ulises Delgado clearly shows that defendant\u2019s exhibit C for identification, the DEA 6 report, was in the possession of defendant\u2019s counsel. Next, defendant\u2019s argument that County Court failed to charge that the accomplice testimony of Hector Gutierrez must be independently corroborated is not only belied by the record, it also appears that defendant did not object to County Court\u2019s charge concerning accomplice testimony, thereby failing to preserve this issue for appellate review (see, People v Vail, 167 AD2d 567).\nFinally, we are of the view that the sentence must be modified to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 15 years to life. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 25 years to life although his brother, who was jointly tried and convicted of the same crimes, was sentenced to the concurrent 15-years-to-life prison terms. In the absence of any cognizable reason to justify the different sentences, we are of the view that defendant\u2019s sentence must be modified (see, People v Williams, 145 AD2d 740).\nJudgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentences imposed upon defendant to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 15 years to life, and, as so modified, affirmed.

Based on the facts adduced at the suppression hearing, we find that the People established probable cause for the arrest of the defendant. Therefore, the recovery and admissibility of the \"buy money\u201d was based on a search incident to a lawful arrest.\nEqually without merit is the defendant\u2019s claim that the indictment should be dismissed as a result of the delay of over nine months after the jury verdict in imposing sentence. It is well settled that a defendant is entitled to be promptly sentenced after conviction; entry of judgment may not be indefinitely deferred or postponed (see, CPL 380.30 [1]; People v Drake, 61 NY2d 359, 364). Where the delay is both protracted and unexplained, the courts will generally find it unreasonable (see, People v Drake, supra, at 365; People ex rel. Harty v Fay, 10 NY2d 374). If, however, the delay is found to have been caused by the defendant, it should not be attributed to the State and therefore, will be found excusable (see, e.g., Matter of Weinstein v Haft, 60 NY2d 625; People v Brazeau, 144 AD2d 977, 978). The majority of the delay was caused by the defendant\u2019s requests for adjournments and hearings regarding his motions. Therefore, we find that the delay in sentencing was not unreasonable.\nHowever, under the circumstances of this case, we modify the sentence imposed, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the term of imprisonment to concurrent indeterminate sentences of 1 to 3 years imprisonment.\nWe have examined the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find that they do not warrant reversal of the judgment. Lawrence, J. P., Eiber, O\u2019Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur. [See, 150 Misc 2d 334.] [/INST] The defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of third-degree criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, resulting in concurrent prison terms of 4 to 12 years. The court upheld the conviction, finding no merit in the defendant's claims regarding the suppression of evidence and delay in sentencing, attributing the latter largely to the defendant's own actions. However, in the interest of justice, the court modified the sentence to concurrent terms of 1 to 3 years.</s>"}

The agreement included a promise to cooperate in the prosecution of his codefendant, an appeal waiver and a waiver of his right to apply for conditional release. County Court imposed a sentence of 365 days in jail. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.\nContrary to defendant\u2019s claim, he was advised, during the plea colloquy and in the written appeal waiver signed in court, that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea agreement. Further, the plea colloquy and the written waiver together establish defendant\u2019s understanding of his appeal rights, which he had discussed with counsel, that the appeal waiver was separate and distinct from the other rights he automatically forfeited by his guilty plea, and that his waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Yaw, 120 AD3d 1447, 1448 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1005 [2014]). Further, defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his appeal waiver and was not preserved for our review by a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, and he did not say anything that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Rouse, 119 AD3d 1161, 1162-1163 [2014]; People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]).\nDefendant claims that conditioning the plea agreement on his waiver of the right to apply for conditional release under Penal Law \u00a7 70.40 (2) was improper. This point was not raised in County Court and, thus, it is not preserved for our review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). His argument that it constitutes a \u201cmode of proceedings error\u201d which can be raised for the first time on appeal is not supported by the statute or case law (see People v Hanley, 20 NY3d 601, 604-605 and n 2 [2013]; compare People v Wright, 119 AD3d 972, 973-974 [2014]). We do not find that conditioning a guilty plea on the waiver of the statutory right to apply for conditional release on parole falls within this \u201ctightly circumscribed class\u201d of fundamental errors for which preservation is not required and to which a defendant cannot consent as part of a plea agreement (People v Kelly, 5 NY3d 116, 120 [2005]; see People v Hanley, 20 NY3d at 604; People v Becoats, 17 NY3d 643, 651 [2011], cert denied 566 US \u2014, 132 S Ct 1970 [2012]; People v Patterson, 39 NY2d 288, 295 [1976], affd 432 US 197 [1977]). This condition does not intrude upon the authority of the Board of Parole to decide a conditional release request, but speaks only to defendant\u2019s right to apply for such relief in this first instance. Finally, given that defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver \u201cencompass [es] any issue that does not involve a right of constitutional dimension going to the very heart of the process\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), this claim is precluded by his appeal waiver.\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr. and Clark, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal possession of marijuana in the third degree, following his guilty plea as part of a plea agreement that included an appeal waiver and a waiver of his right to apply for conditional release.

Additionally, the defendant's claims regarding the plea conditions were not preserved for appeal, and his appeal waiver precluded consideration of these arguments.</s>"}

In July 2005, after discussions regarding the potential retroactivity of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004, County Court sentenced defendant, pursuant to that new law, to two concurrent prison terms of three years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. The District Attorney appeals, contending that the court should have applied the prior sentencing law. We agree.\nThe Legislature addressed retroactivity of the new sentencing provisions by directing that the new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 \u201cshall take effect on the thirtieth day [January 13, 2005] after [the Act] shall have become a law, and . . . shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof\u2019 (L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]; see People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 597 n [2005]). While, in the absence of evidence of contrary intent, the general rule is to retroactively apply remedial or ameliorative amendments, explicit legislation setting forth a prospective effective date \u201cis sufficient to overcome any presumption of retroactivity\u201d (People v Sutton, 199 AD2d 878, 879 [1993]; see Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law \u00a7 60.04, 2006 Pocket Part, at 60-61). The Legislature\u2019s language in the Drug Law Reform Act \u201cexpresses an intent to negate the amelioration doctrine,\u201d thereby permitting the Act to apply only to class B felonies committed after its effective date (People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005]; see People v Fields, 25 AD3d 343 [2006]). Because defendant committed his crimes prior to that effective date, County Court should have sentenced him under the prior sentencing laws.\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nHarvey, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Traficanti, Jr., J.), rendered October 18, 1988 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nIn September 1987, defendant was indicted by a Grand Jury for the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and conspiracy in the fourth degree. Following plea-bargaining negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and conspiracy in the second degree. Defendant was then sentenced upon his plea to the recommended indeterminate prison terms of 3 to 9 years on the conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and 3 to 9 years on the conviction for conspiracy. The terms were to run concurrently.\nThereafter, it was discovered that the original sentence imposed for the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance was not made in accordance with law. Specifically, the imposed sentence was based upon the parties\u2019 mistaken belief that a conviction for attempted sale resulted in the reduction of the charge from a class A-II to a class B felony. As a result, defendant was given the opportunity on two separate occasions to withdraw his previous plea or to replead to a lesser crime, but defendant refused to do so. Ultimately, upon defendant\u2019s repeated refusal to withdraw his plea, Supreme Court vacated the original sentence of 3 to 9 years on defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and resentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of three years to life on that crime, again to run concurrently with the conspiracy conviction. Following the imposition of this sentence defendant then attempted to withdraw his plea and the court refused. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Under the circumstances of this case, it was within Supreme Court\u2019s discretion to resentence defendant to a term of imprisonment greater than that for which he had originally plea bargained. It is undisputed that the original sentence of 3 to 9 years imposed by the court for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was illegal since, as a class A-II felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [2]; \u00a7 220.41), the maximum term mandated by law for that crime is life imprisonment (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [a]). As a result, the sentence could not stand by operation of law (see, People v Beach, 152 AD2d 772). While such a situation entitles the defendant to vacatur of the sentence and the opportunity to withdraw the guilty plea (see, supra; People v Shelton, 100 AD2d 775), defendant chose not to withdraw his plea despite several documented opportunities for him to do so. Defendant even declined the People\u2019s offer to allow him to plead to a lesser count of the indictment which would support the originally agreed-upon sentence. Since only the sentence and not the underlying plea was illegal, the proper curative course, in the absence of defendant\u2019s consent to do otherwise, was to resentence him in accordance with law (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445, 450). The sentence imposed by the court was the lowest legal sentence that could be given and, accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion or other grounds for reversal.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Weiss and Harvey, JJ., concur.\nSupreme Court first mistakenly vacated defendant\u2019s valid guilty plea sua sponte and then realized its error and let the plea stand (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445, 450). [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of conspiracy and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty. Initially sentenced to 3 to 9 years, the original sentence was found to be illegal due to a misclassification of the felony, leading the court to resentence him to a term of three years to life. Despite having opportunities to withdraw his plea or accept a lesser charge, the defendant chose not to, and the court found no grounds for reversal.</s>"}

In accord with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to three years in prison, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we note that, although defendant waived his right to appeal, his waiver is invalid as he was not advised that the waiver was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 892-893 [2006]; People v Hill, 118 AD3d 1191, 1192 [2014]). Turning to his substantive contentions, defendant asserts that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Although defendant failed to preserve this claim by making an appropriate postal-locution motion (see People v Vandemark, 117 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]), we are required to examine further, as he argues that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was triggered by his statements in the course of the plea colloquy negating an essential element of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see People v Worden, 22 NY3d 982, 985 [2013]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Zabele, 53 AD3d 685, 686 [2008]).\nDefendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.34). During the plea allocution, he related that he was pleading guilty \u201cunder false pretenses\u201d and stated, \u201cI wasn\u2019t selling nothing, I was bringing it to someone else.\u201d County Court responded by advising defendant that \u201c[t]he law defines a sale as any transfer, any giving, selling, transferring\u201d and noted that \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t have to be for money, it doesn\u2019t have to be for anything of value\u201d (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 [1]). Defendant thereafter replied that he was aware of this and, in response to further inquiry by the court, admitted that he had engaged in such conduct. Upon review, we find that the court\u2019s further inquiries and defendant\u2019s responses were adequate to dispel any doubt as to defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge, and to ensure that his plea was intelligently entered (compare People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 678 [1999]). Thus, we find the exception inapplicable.\nThe record of defendant\u2019s participation at both the plea proceeding and arraignment does not support his further contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to request a CPL article 730 competency hearing. Defendant is presumed competent, and a history of mental illness and substance abuse does not necessarily rebut this presumption (see People v Bennett, 30 AD3d 631, 631 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 809 [2006]; People v Medina, 249 AD2d 694, 694 [1998]). No record evidence suggests that defense counsel\u2019s decision was not \u201ca sound defense strategy,\u201d or that defendant was otherwise deprived of meaningful representation (People v Barclay, 1 AD3d 705, 707 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 567 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Defendant\u2019s counsel ultimately negotiated a favorable plea agreement that substantially reduced his sentencing exposure (see People v Leszczynski, 96 AD3d 1162, 1162-1163 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 998 [2012]). The sentence was imposed in accord with that agreement and, considering defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, we find his claim that it was harsh and excessive without merit (see People v Sherald, 45 AD3d 973 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 771 [2008]).\nStein, J.E, Rose, Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Following the denial, after a hearing, of his application for participation in a judicial diversion program (hereinafter JDP) (see CPL 216.05), the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, specifically preserving his right to appeal the denial of his application to participate in a JDP. He was thereafter sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a determinate term of imprisonment of six years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision.\nThe defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the County Court erred in denying his application to participate in a JDP. \u201cCourts are afforded great deference in making judicial diversion determinations\u201d (People v Williams, 105 AD3d 1428, 1428 [2013]; see People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1383 [2013]; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]).

Upon our review of the record, we find that the court providently exercised its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s application to participate in a JDP (see People v Powell, 110 AD3d at 1383; People v Williams, 105 AD3d at 1428).\nChambers, J.P., Dickerson, Hinds-Radix and Connolly, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nIn connection with a plea agreement, defendant signed a 12-page document in which, among other things, he agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree as set forth in one count of a superior court information, and purportedly waived the right to appeal. One paragraph of the document stated that if defendant was arrested before sentencing, County Court would not be bound by the sentencing agreement and could sentence him up to the maximum permissible sentence. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested for possessing drugs and ultimately pleaded guilty in another court to a related charge. Based on that arrest, the court did not impose the one-year sentence included in the plea agreement for the present charge, but instead imposed an enhanced sentence of 2V2 years in prison, followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant asserts that County Court improperly enhanced his sentence in violation of the plea agreement. Under the circumstances here, defendant\u2019s challenge is not precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005] ). Further, although defendant did not properly preserve this issue, we choose to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action (see id.). A court may enhance an agreed-upon sentence after it is established that the defendant violated a condition of the plea agreement (see People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 812-813 [2009]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 894 [2006] , lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]). Under People v Parker (57 NY2d 136 [1982]), for a defendant to waive the right to be sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, the court must inform the defendant in some manner of the right that is at issue and the consequences of failing to abide by the conditions set by the court (id. at 141). The People contend that the one paragraph of the 12-page document constituted a sufficient Parker admonishment concerning the no-arrest condition. We disagree.\nDuring the plea colloquy here, County Court never mentioned Parker warnings or the one paragraph in the document that imposed the no-arrest condition. In fact, the court did not discuss anything specific about the document whatsoever. The court merely asked defendant whether the document contained his signature and initials, if he had reviewed it with counsel, and if he had any questions and was willing to plead guilty in exchange for a sentencing promise. This colloquy was simply not sufficient to insure that defendant was fully aware of the adverse consequences that might flow from his being arrested prior to the imposition of sentence. This flaw in defendant\u2019s plea allocution was not remedied by the court\u2019s incorporation by reference of the 12-page affidavit that contained a single paragraph describing the circumstances that could lead to the imposition of an enhanced sentence (cf. People v Kinch, 15 AD3d 780, 781 [2005]; compare People v Bunce, 45 AD3d 982, 984 [2007] , lv denied 10 NY3d 809 [2008]). While written statements or affidavits may serve as a helpful supplement to a colloquy with the court concerning a plea or the waiver of certain rights, these writings cannot be substituted for on-the-record discussions between the defendant and the court. Due to the inadequacy of the Parker warnings here, we remit for County Court to either impose the agreed-upon sentence or permit defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea before imposing an enhanced sentence (see People v Armstead, 52 AD3d 966, 968 [2008] ).\nWe take this opportunity to condemn the practice of \u201cplea by check off list.\u201d A court\u2019s constitutional responsibility to review the terms and conditions of the plea agreement, the defendant\u2019s rights and those rights that the defendant is giving up and the concomitant responsibility to ascertain that the defendant understands them and is knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waiving them must appear \u201con the face of the record\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11 [1989]; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 244 [1974]). These weighty matters should not be merely relegated to a lengthy written docu ment, but must be developed in an appropriate manner on the record.\nMercure, J.E, Spain, Kane, Kavanagh and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Greene County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\n. Although defendant does not challenge the plea itself, given the utter lack of substance during the colloquy, it was insufficient to adequately constitute a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea or waiver of appeal.\n. We note that defendant initialed conflicting paragraphs indicating both that he could and could not read the English language. He further initialed a paragraph waiving any right to contest \u201cthe above-stated predicate conviction [s]\u201d notwithstanding his lack of any prior felony conviction and an X through the previous paragraph discussing predicate convictions. County Court did not address these blatant inconsistencies during the colloquy. [/INST] The court found that the defendant's plea agreement was inadequately explained, particularly regarding the consequences of a pre-sentencing arrest, which resulted in an enhanced sentence rather than the agreed-upon one. The court determined that the plea colloquy did not provide sufficient information for the defendant to knowingly waive his rights, leading to the decision to vacate the enhanced sentence and allow the defendant either to receive the original sentence or withdraw his plea. The ruling emphasized the importance of clear communication between the court and the defendant regarding plea agreements.</s>"}

At the time, defendant was advised by County Court that \"in all probability in a plea of guilty * * * the court would sentence [defendant] to pay a fine\u201d not to exceed $50,000. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine in that amount. However, no finding as to the amount of defendant\u2019s gain from the crime was made by the court at the time of sentencing, nor was a hearing held on the issue prior to sentencing.\nOn this appeal, defendant complains, and the prosecution agrees, that there was no compliance with the provisions of Penal Law \u00a7 80.10 (1) (a) and (e), and where, as here, the fine imposed exceeded $10,000, there must be compliance with Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 (3) (see, Penal Law \u00a7 80.10 [3]) requiring a hearing to determine the amount of defendant\u2019s gain. Defendant therefore requests, and the prosecution agrees, that the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for an appropriate hearing (see, People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d 920).\nJudgment reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Schenectady County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Main, Casey and Mikoll, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court reversed the judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County, which had sentenced the defendant, a corporation, to a $50,000 fine for unlawful use of secret scientific material without holding a required hearing to determine the amount of the defendant\u2019s gain from the crime. Both the defendant and prosecution agreed that the sentencing did not comply with applicable Penal Law provisions, leading to the decision to vacate the sentence and remand the case for a proper hearing.</s>"}

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Williams, J.), rendered January 26, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nOn March 11, 1987, defendant was indicted for two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On June 17, 1987, defendant was charged in another indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marihuana, all allegedly committed at the time of his arrest on the first set of charges. County Court assigned the same counsel to represent defendant on each indictment.\nOn December 8, 1987, defendant appeared before Supreme Court Justice Robert C. Williams, acting as Sullivan County Judge, and, in response to the court\u2019s inquiry, indicated that he had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the significance of the plea proceedings with his assigned counsel. Thereupon, the District Attorney recited into the record the plea arrangement that had been agreed upon among the District Attorney, defendant and his counsel. Defendant agreed that terms of the agreement were satisfactory and entered guilty pleas to the first count of each indictment in full satisfaction of all charges.\nOn January 25, 1988, when the parties again appeared before Justice Williams for sentencing, defendant\u2019s attorney advised the court that defendant wished to withdraw his guilty plea. After counsel presented the court with eight handwritten yellow pages wherein defendant somewhat incoherently tried to explain his misunderstanding of the process that resulted in the indictments against him, Justice Williams remanded defendant until the following day so that he could read the allocution minutes made at the time of the plea. On January 26, 1988 the court reporter read the minutes into the record. They revealed that the District Attorney was willing to accept a plea of guilty to the first count of each indictment in full satisfaction of both instruments in exchange for a recommended prison sentence of 2 to 6 years on each count, to run concurrently, and that defendant and his counsel agreed to accept the recommendation. The court, after reciting into the record that it found no evidence that would cause it to believe that defendant was threatened or coerced into pleading guilty, imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals claiming that his request to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted in light of his repeated complaints to Sullivan County Judge Eugene M. Hanofee about his assigned counsel\u2019s lack of attention to his case.\nDefendant\u2019s reliance on People v McKennion (27 NY2d 671) to support his contention that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted is misplaced. Here, Justice Williams afforded defendant a reasonable opportunity to advance his claims and, after weighing the same, made an informed and prudent determination that the motion should be denied (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 525-526). Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his plea of guilty was induced by his attorney\u2019s failure to adequately inform him of the reasons that a guilty plea was in his best interest. The court meticulously interrogated the District Attorney, defense counsel and defendant during the reading of the plea allocution minutes and was satisfied that defendant fully understood the consequences of his guilty plea (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17; People v Frederick, supra; People v Murphy, 142 AD2d 776).\nFinally, while assigned counsel was somewhat remiss in the frequency of his visits to defendant while he was incarcerated, given the favorable sentences he negotiated on defendant\u2019s behalf in exchange for guilty pleas to very serious crimes, we cannot conclude on this record that counsel was guilty of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137,147).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Casey, Weiss, Mercure and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance following his guilty plea. Despite the defendant's request to withdraw his plea, citing inadequate legal representation, the court found no evidence of coercion and concluded that the defendant had a sufficient understanding of the plea process. The court also determined that the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, as the favorable sentencing negotiated by his attorney outweighed any shortcomings in communication.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCarpinello, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 23, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant signed a waiver of indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to that charge and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison with shock program eligibility. County Court informed defendant that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if any additional crimes were committed prior to sentencing. At the time of sentencing, it was discovered that defendant had pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in Nassau County. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant to 4 to 12 years in prison. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant contends, inter alia, that his waivers of indictment and the right to appeal must be invalidated because they were not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. Initially, we note that by failing to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has not preserved his challenge to his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Gonzalez, 299 AD2d 581, 582; People v Holland, 270 AD2d 718, lv denied 95 NY2d 798). Likewise, \u201c[t]he issue of the validity of his waiver of indictment is also unpreserved for review as it was forfeited by defendant\u2019s guilty plea\u201d (People v Gonzalez, supra at 582).\nNevertheless, were we to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s claims, we would find them unpersuasive. During the course of the plea proceedings, County Court inquired as to whether defendant voluntarily executed the waivers, had an opportunity to discuss them with his attorney and understood the rights he was relinquishing by signing them. Defendant answered these questions in the affirmative. Moreover, the terms of the waivers, which were executed in open court, clearly set forth their ramifications and were signed by both defendant and his attorney. Under these circumstances, we find that the waivers were knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see id.; People v Catalfamo, 228 AD2d 786, 787).\nDefendant further asserts that his waiver of the right to appeal should be annulled and the plea agreement set aside because he was not informed of the maximum sentence that could be imposed in the event he violated the terms of the plea agreement. He seeks to have the enhanced sentence invalidated as harsh and excessive. \u201c[W]e have held that where a defendant who concomitantly validly pleaded guilty and waived all appeal rights receives an enhanced sentence based upon a violation of the terms of the plea agreement, any claim addressed to the harshness or excessiveness of the enhanced sentence falls within the scope of the waiver of the right to appeal, provided the defendant is informed of the maximum potential sentence for noncompliance with the plea agreement\u201d (People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800; see People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827; People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513). Although County Court advised defendant during the plea proceedings that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement, it did not inform him of the maximum sentence that could be imposed. Consequently, defendant is not precluded from challenging the severity of his sentence. Nevertheless, we do not find any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Shea, supra at 513). We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be unavailing.\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Spain and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The judgment from the County Court of Ulster County convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance was upheld despite the defendant's appeal challenging the validity of his waivers of indictment and appeal rights, which were found to be knowingly and voluntarily executed. Although the court failed to inform the defendant of the maximum potential sentence for violating the plea agreement, no extraordinary circumstances were found to warrant a reduction of his enhanced sentence of 4 to 12 years in prison. The court affirmed the original judgment.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMugglin, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, J.), rendered January 17, 2007, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nPursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison. On the occasion of his first appeal, defendant\u2019s sentence was vacated due to the People\u2019s failure to file a second felony offender statement as required by CPL 400.21 (8 AD3d 904 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]). Upon remittal for resentencing, the People submitted the requisite second felony offender statement and defendant admitted the allegations contained therein. Defendant, however, also informed County Court, through counsel, that he \u201cintends to challenge the constitutionality of the conviction . . . just acknowledged\u201d (30 AD3d 897 [2006]), but County Court made no further inquiry into defendant\u2019s assertion and resentenced him, as a second felony offender, to 5 to 10 years in prison. Due to County Court\u2019s failure to inquire into the nature of defendant\u2019s challenge or afford him the opportunity to explain it, the matter was again remitted to County Court for redetermination of his second felony offender status and resentencing (id.).\nUpon remittal, County Court convened a hearing into defendant\u2019s second felony offender status and defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his prior conviction. In the papers submitted to County Court, defendant asserted that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel during the prosecution of his previous felony conviction. Following the hearing, County Court determined that defendant received the effective assistance of counsel on the occasion of his previous conviction and thereafter resentenced him to 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nPursuant to CPL 400.21, the People bear the initial burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a previous felony conviction (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15 [1983]). \u201cOnce the fact of the prior conviction has been established, it is then incumbent upon the defendant to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim that the conviction was unconstitutionally obtained\u201d (id. [citation omitted]). Here, the certificate of conviction filed by the People\u2014and received without objection\u2014satisfied their burden of proving the existence of the previous felony conviction. The burden was then upon defendant to allege and prove that his previous conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Upon review of the record, the only basis for defendant\u2019s claim warranting extended discussion is his assertion that he informed counsel of his desire to file an appeal but no appeal was filed. In support of this claim, defendant presented only an assertion in an affidavit that he was informed of his right to appeal by County Court and that \u201ceven though [defendant] told [counsel] [he] wanted to appeal, [counsel] did not file a Notice of Appeal.\u201d Defendant presented no other proof and, although County Court offered him the opportunity to do so, he declined to take the stand at the hearing, or to call witnesses or present any other proof. Under these circumstances, we find defendant\u2019s self-serving affidavit, without more, insufficient to satisfy his burden and overcome \u201cthe presumptions of the validity and regularity of the previous felony conviction []\u201d (id. at 16; see People v Wheeler, 7 AD3d 281, 281 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 683 [2004]).\nFurthermore, we note that there is no evidence in the record that, once it became clear to defendant that his attorney had not filed a notice of appeal of the conviction at issue\u2014the right to which defendant admits he was informed by County Court, along with the 30-day time limit\u2014defendant made any effort to pursue an appeal, including by request for an extension of the time to file pursuant to CPL 460.30. Such circumstance limits the persuasiveness of defendant\u2019s present assertion that he wanted to appeal his conviction and that he communicated this desire to counsel, and that, as a result, his counsel was ineffective (see People v McDonough, 87 AD2d 727, 727 [1982]). Thus, inasmuch as defendant failed to prove that his previous conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, we affirm defendant\u2019s resentence.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be without merit.\nCardona, P.J., Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the resentencing of the defendant to 5 to 10 years in prison for criminal possession of a controlled substance after a hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding a prior felony conviction. The defendant failed to prove that his prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, as he provided only a self-serving affidavit without additional evidence, and did not pursue an appeal after being informed of his rights. The court found no merit in the defendant's remaining contentions.</s>"}
