It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \nDoctor: Okay. \nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \nDoctor: Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life? \nPatient: No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain.  He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

When did you get hurt? \nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \nDoctor: What did they do for you?\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \nDoctor: Did this help at all?\nPatient: No, not at all. \nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \nDoctor: When did you see them? \nPatient: That was back in April. \nDoctor: What did they recommend? \nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\nPatient: It's really on my right. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\nPatient: Really, no, it did not. I still have the pain down my legs today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?\nPatient: Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often.\nDoctor: Oh boy, that's a lot going on!\nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?\nPatient: No, it's fine.\nDoctor: And are you taking anything for constipation? \nPatient: Well, just prune juice.\nDoctor: Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help. How bout cough? Any pain in the ribs while coughing?\nPatient: Nah, I am not bothered by it.\nDoctor: Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?\nPatient: Um, no I am fine.\nDoctor: Any fall or imbalance problem?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any agitation or any other issues? \nPatient: Well, I am doing okay! Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me.\nDoctor: That's good!\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. \nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: And no side effects, right?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. \nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?\nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOverall, the patient has been doing reasonably well.  She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her.  There has been a note that she is constipated. Her blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188.  I see a couple in the 150s.  However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year. She is not having problems with breathing.  No neurologic complaints or troubles.  Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.<|eot_id|>"}

Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks.

Patient: Sure. \nDoctor: So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months. \nPatient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results. \nDoctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like? \nPatient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed? \nPatient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up. \nDoctor: How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home? \nPatient: I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.\nDoctor: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? \nPatient: Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache. \nDoctor: Do you snore? \nPatient: I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep. \nDoctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep? \nPatient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night. \nDoctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore? \nPatient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.\nDoctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime? \nPatient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours. \nDoctor: Do you smoke? \nPatient: Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner. \nDoctor: Have you noticed any change in your weight? \nPatient: My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago. \nDoctor: If that was your maximum how is your weight now? \nPatient: Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds. \nDoctor: So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel. \nPatient: That sounds right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient presented initially to the Pulmonary Clinic with dyspnea on minimal exertion.

In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results. The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks. During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours. The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner. She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.  Since that time, her weight is down by approximately 30 pounds.

Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.

Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.

Could you give me a run down on the eleven month old patient? \nGuest_clinician: The patient was presented with stage two neuroblastoma on the left when he was six weeks old. It was completely resected. It was shown not to be N Myc amplified and had some favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Great. Did he have a follow up after?\nGuest_clinician: He did. There was a second primary in his right adrenal gland. They performed a biopsy, which was consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Did he receive any chemotherapy?\nGuest_clinician: He is now being treated with it per protocol P nine six four one and not on study. His last chemotherapy appointment was on May twenty first two thousand and seven. They used carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.\nDoctor: What did they do after chemotherapy? \nGuest_clinician: He received G C S F daily because he had neutropenia that delayed his second cycle. \nDoctor: Thank you, Nurse. I'll go talk to the mother. \nGuest_clinican: No problem, Doctor. \nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. It's nice to see you again. How is your little boy doing?\nGuest_family: Not so well. Since out last visit, he had a stuffy nose for a couple of days. \nDoctor: Is it getting worse?\nGuest_family: I think it's getting better now. It isn't as stuffy. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. Has he been sick or had any fevers?\nGuest_family: Nope. Just the stuffy nose.\nDoctor: Has he been able to eat anything?\nGuest_family: At times, he didn't want to eat. It seemed like he wasn't hungry. \nDoctor: Does he still have a reduced appetite?\nGuest_family: Not anymore. He's starting to eat again.\nDoctor: Did he have any nausea or vomiting after he ate?\nGuest_family: Thankfully, no. I would have made my husband clean up the vomit. \nDoctor: That's great. Is he able to pee and poop fine? No diarrhea, right?\nGuest_family: His poop has been solid. I haven't seen anything bad about his pee either. \nDoctor: Great. Would you be able to open his mouth for me? I just want to check if everything's fine inside. \nGuest_family: Of course. Say ah. \nPatient: Ah. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks like he's showing some symptoms of thrush again. \nGuest_family: Oh, no. Should we restart fluconazole?\nDoctor: It's just a fungal infection inside the mouth. I'll prescribe him fluconazole. It should get rid of it. \nGuest_family: Thank you so much. You all have been so helpful.

In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.  He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.

In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.

Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you please confirm your age?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Thirty four.\nDoctor: Let me take a look at your medical records. I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct? \nPatient: Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up. \nDoctor: Who told you to have a follow up? \nPatient: One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor. \nDoctor: I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day. \nPatient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that? \nDoctor: Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell? \nPatient: Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me.  \nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \nDoctor: I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that either. \nDoctor: That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure? \nPatient: Yeah, I do. \nDoctor: I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.<|eot_id|>"}

I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.\nDoctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? \nPatient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. \nDoctor: How did you respond to the procedure? \nPatient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. \nDoctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? \nPatient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. \nDoctor: Do you remember which side it was in?\nPatient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.\nDoctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?\nPatient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. \nDoctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? \nPatient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. \nDoctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? \nPatient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. \nDoctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. \nPatient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. \nDoctor: When was that?\nPatient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. \nDoctor: Is that when you had the last injections? \nPatient: Correct. \nDoctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?\nPatient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. \nDoctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?\nPatient: Yes, it still hurts. \nDoctor: What makes the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. \nDoctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?\nPatient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. \nDoctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? \nPatient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet.

She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.

What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? \nPatient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. \nDoctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? \nPatient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. \nDoctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. \nPatient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet?

She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.

He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|>"}

She last came to our clinic in January two thousand and eight. At that time, she was recommended to follow up with Doctor Y for the medical management of her chronic headaches.

I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages. \nDoctor: Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it? \nPatient: Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down.\nDoctor: Is it like specific to any particular area of your head? \nPatient: It is like all over but, uh, very much intense in the forehead. \nDoctor: Is there any nausea associated with the headaches? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Anything else that happens along with these headaches? \nPatient: Yeah, I get that ringing sound in my ears, and I just don't feel well. \nDoctor: Any changes in your vision? \nPatient: Yeah, it gets blurry, and I feel like lights are dimming.

We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.<|eot_id|>"}

What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is very low, generally less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, and cast tightness. I would not worry about these risks.

These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nErosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.   I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.<|eot_id|>"}

What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five.

I have been seeing her since two thousand and two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?\nPatient: Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after. \nDoctor: I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\nPatient: I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise. \nDoctor: I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 78-year-old male who recently had his right knee replaced and also back surgery about a year and a half ago.

Is it tender? \nPatient: No, there's no real tenderness. \nDoctor: How long has this calf been enlarged? \nPatient: Um, it's been several months at this point. \nDoctor: Have you ever had D V T? \nPatient: Yes, um, in nineteen seventy five, and in nineteen eighty five. \nDoctor: Are you having any abnormal weight loss? \nPatient: No, everything is normal there, and I'm eating normally. \nDoctor: What about any cold or flu symptoms?

I'm breathing just fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 65-year-old female who underwent left upper lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.  She returns for a routine surveillance visit. She has undergone since her last visit an abdominopelvic CT, which shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney.  She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.

Right.\nDoctor: Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? \nPatient: It's been about ten days now. \nDoctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? \nPatient: No, they keep getting worse. \nDoctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? \nPatient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right.

Since December eleventh. \nDoctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? \nPatient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.  \nDoctor: What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? \nPatient: He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong.

On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95.

By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.

Yes. \nDoctor: Did you take any medication? \nPatient: Lots of it. My son wrote it on a paper so that I could give you the names. Here you go. \nDoctor: I see you were given papaverine. Did that help? \nPatient: They did. My headaches would vanish. \nDoctor: How long did you take it for? \nPatient: I think six months. My headaches stopped for a while, but they came back in two thousand and four. \nDoctor: How often would you say you get headaches now? \nPatient: I think more than before. Like one to two per week. I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours. \nDoctor: Do you take the papaverine when you feel it? \nPatient: I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.  \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever experience any problems with your vision too? \nPatient: Yes. A lot. There were zig zag lines coming out of nowhere. I thought I was going to die. \nDoctor: Oh, wow.

Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness right now? \nPatient: Now that you mentioned it, I am. \nDoctor: Have you ever fainted before? \nPatient: I think one time. My son was there to help. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. I'll write down that you experienced a syncope. Did you take any medication for this?\nPatient: I took some Russian medicine.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Are you from Russia? \nPatient: No. I'm from Ukraine. \nDoctor: That's wonderful. How did the medicine help? \nPatient: It helped me a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}

The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. \nDoctor: I see. How did you hurt it? \nPatient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. \nDoctor: Did it hurt before that? \nPatient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. \nDoctor: The recent injury made it worse?\nPatient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. \nDoctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? \nPatient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. \nPatient: My scapho- what? \nDoctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist.

However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.

Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty. \nGuest_family: Where should that be normally?\nDoctor: He should be able to get to ninety. \nGuest_family: What can we do about this? \nDoctor: I think we should do surgery on this leg. How does he walk? Can I see?  \nGuest_family: Well, just look at him. \nDoctor: Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking. \nGuest_family: Can we correct that instead of the hamstring tightness? \nDoctor: Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well. \nGuest_family: Okay, right now we want to do surgery to fix his walking. What are the risks of infection?\nDoctor: They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. \nGuest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. \nGuest_family: Yes, we'd like to do the procedure. Let me text my husband really quick. Okay, yes, my husband agrees.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.<|eot_id|>"}

My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. \nDoctor: How would you describe your headaches? \nPatient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. \nDoctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? \nPatient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.\nDoctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? \nPatient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. \nGuest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.\nDoctor: How about your weight? \nPatient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. \nGuest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.\nDoctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month? \nPatient: It has been bad.

He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia.

When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort.  He notices that the toes are in an extended position.  He steps on the ground and they seem to \"pop into place.\"  He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp.  Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep. He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs.  These do not occur at night and are completely random.  He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp. He has never had any symptoms like this in the past.  He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago.  He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now.  He cannot think of any other possible contributing factors to his symptoms. He has a history of HIV for 21 years.  He was taking antiretroviral medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago.  He reports that he was unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset.  He has a CD4 count of 326.  He states that he has never developed AIDS.  He is considering resuming antiretroviral treatment.<|eot_id|>"}
