Since then, he has been complaining of issues with his shoulder. He is not able to raise his hand above his head and sometimes at night he complains of numbness in his right hand fingers. That kind of made me worried.\nDoctor: Hm, okay. Mom, did he get hurt anywhere else too, like head, face or chest? \nGuest_family: No, he landed on his shoulder thankfully. Didn't hit his head. He was also wearing a helmet.\nDoctor: Okay, so are you giving him anything for his shoulder, like pain meds or anti inflammatory to ease his stiffness?\nGuest_family: No, nothing. Although I gave him some honey for his sore throat. He has been complaining of a sore throat, he has a long standing history of strep throat and he did have some exposure to strep. \nDoctor: Hm, did he have any fever or rashes? \nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation?\nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Okay, let me check his shoulder, do you have any other concerns?\nGuest_family: Actually yes, Jay suffers from A D H D, he-\nDoctor: He is seeing Doctor B, right? \nGuest_family: Yes, and the doctor has prescribed him Adderall and Zoloft once a day.

He does realize that it's a problem but he can't help it, and this worries me. We have talked about getting help and he has agreed for counselling.

He does notice when he does not take his medication.  He is doing well in school.  He is socializing well.  He is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications.  However, he is having issues with anger control.  He realizes when he has anger outbursts that it is a problem.  His mom is concerned.

There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it.

I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}

Thank you. \nDoctor: So, you just celebrated your birthday. How was it? How is it feeling to be close to forties? \nPatient: I just turned thirty nine. I would say older the wiser. \nDoctor: That's true. Okay, so you are here for your follow up. Let's see, you have type one diabetes mellitus, right?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Last time I was here almost four months ago. \nDoctor: How are you doing since last visit? \nPatient: I have been good. My sugar has been under the range. Unfortunately, my pump was having some issues for the last two weeks. \nDoctor: Oh no. What happened? \nPatient: I don't know. I tried to get it fixed but nothing worked out, so I had to buy a new one and then being old kind of hit me. You know, I was not able to set it up. I was stuck on the pump settings and was having a lot of difficulties. With all this going on, I was not able to control my sugar over past two weeks and there might have been like some ups and downs in my levels which I could not notice or register. \nDoctor: During this, did you notice anything like, did you lose your consciousness? Did you faint? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about sweating, tired, or lightheadedness and or change in vision? Or any kind of confusion in mind? \nPatient: Nope, nothing like that. \nDoctor: That's good, so there hasn't been any hypoglycemic event. I mean, your sugar didn't drop down. \nPatient: Oh yeah, I didn't think so. \nDoctor: Okay, let's see how about hyperglycemia? Did you think your sugar levels went high? \nPatient: I think, there was some difficulties with both the fasting and after meals, but I'm not sure. \nDoctor: Are you urinating more than normal? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Are you eating more than normal or drinking more than normal? Are you feeling thirsty or not? \nPatient: Not that I noticed. \nDoctor: Are you exercising? \nPatient: Oh, I tried but didn't work out so not exercising at this point, but I follow a fixed diet. But you know, being a mother is in itself full of physical activities. I mean, I have twins and also a young baby who keep me busy. \nDoctor: Are you working? \nPatient: Yes, I'm working as a medical coder. It is a full time job and you just keep busy. Sometimes I don't even realize that I missed my meal, but I do keep some snacks with me I'm just eating while completing my work. It might not be the best case scenario, but I don't get any time for any kind of physical activities. \nDoctor: Are you visiting your physician regularly? \nPatient: Of course. I'm very regular. I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done. All was good. \nPatient: This reminded me that we did a lab last time I came. How did it go? \nDoctor: Oh yes, thank you for reminding me. Let's see how your numbers are. Your cholesterol is still high. Your L D L recorded one hundred and forty four.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 39-year-old woman returns for followup management of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

She is not exercising at this point and has a diet that is rather typical of woman with twins and a young single child as well.  She is working on a full-time basis and so eats on the run a lot, probably eats more than she should and not making the best choices, little time for physical activity.  She is keeping up with all her other appointments and has recently had a good eye examination.

He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.

We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.

We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.

She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.

The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.

These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nErosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.   I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.<|eot_id|>"}

Here's a report from my local doctor. \nDoctor: I see. It says you have hay fever, eczema, sinus problems, and hives, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, I guess so. \nDoctor: Does this run in your family? \nPatient: Uhm. I don't think so. I know my mom has some type of cancer in her mouth. \nDoctor: I see. Have you been screened for cancer before? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. Here's the report with all that information. \nDoctor: This looks good. It says you don't have melanoma or skin cancers or psoriasis. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. So, what's all this stuff on my skin? \nDoctor: Hm. Let me take a look. Have you been sunburned before? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I had some and it burned a lot. \nDoctor: I see. Are you currently taking any medications? \nPatient: It's on the report from my local doctor. \nDoctor: Looks like you're taking benzoyl peroxide and Daypro.

How old are you? \nPatient: I'm twenty four.  \nDoctor: So, what brought you here? How can I help you? \nPatient: I was out for fishing this weekend, I think I got into some poison ivy and I have these rashes all over my chest, legs, arms and also some are on my back. \nDoctor: You seem so confident of it being poison ivy has it happened before? \nPatient: Oh yes, it has happened several times before. It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection. \nDoctor: Okay, let me check my records. It looks like he gave you eighty milligrams of depomedrol. How was it last time after the injection? \nPatient: It worked fine. It did take us some time to get rid of it. \nDoctor: Did you take any medicine or anything else this time?\nPatient: I took over the counter Benadryl. Also, I'm applying cortisone cream on the rashes. \nDoctor: Did they help you? \nPatient: I saw a little bit of improvement. But this weekend it seemed to have been worst.\nDoctor: No worries, let's set you up for another injection.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHe is a 24-year-old male who said that he had gotten into some poison ivy this weekend while he was fishing.

He said that it worked fairly well, although it seemed to still take awhile to get rid of it.  He has been using over-the-counter Benadryl as well as cortisone cream on the areas of the rash and having a little bit of improvement, but this last weekend he must have gotten into some more poison ivy because he has got another outbreak along his chest, legs, arms and back.<|eot_id|>"}
