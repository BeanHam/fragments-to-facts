She used to have shakes and lose consciousness. \nDoctor: Was she taking any medications for that? \nGuest_family: Yeah, she was placed on Keppra solution one hundred and fifty M G for two times a day. It helped a lot and she was doing fine. Her seizures were improving a lot but recently we have noticed something similar again. \nDoctor: What kind of symptoms are showing now? \nGuest_family: She will just stop doing everything and stare blankly. We tried to shake her but during that period she just does not respond.\nDoctor: Does she becomes floppy like can't control her body during that phase? \nGuest_family: No, we didn't notice that. \nDoctor: How long is that period? \nGuest_family2: I think it lasts somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. \nDoctor: What are your thoughts on this? As a mother you might be spending more time with her. \nGuest_family: Yeah, I have noticed this too, but I think it stays for like three to four minutes. \nDoctor: So, it is somewhere around thirty to forty seconds.\nGuest_family: One day I was outside the store and then I noticed that she had a similar event. Her skin around her mouth turned blue. \nDoctor: Was she having any kind of jerky motions?\nGuest_family: No. \nDoctor: Have you changed her medications like the amount you are giving or anything like that? \nGuest_family: No, we haven't changed anything. She's still on the same dose. \nDoctor: I'm looking at the record and it says that she is supposed to take twenty M G per kilogram every day. It looks like a very low dose for her.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.<|im_end|>\n"}

What seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|im_end|>\n"}

He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the \"bad crowd\" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.

I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done.

What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|im_end|>\n"}

Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?\nPatient: Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after. \nDoctor: I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\nPatient: I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise. \nDoctor: I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThis is a 78-year-old male who recently had his right knee replaced and also back surgery about a year and a half ago.

Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \nDoctor: Let me take a look.

Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.

That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? \nGuest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint.\nDoctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension.

The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.

Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.

I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands.

Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|im_end|>\n"}

Who do we have here today?\nGuest_family: Hello, this is our son, A B C. \nDoctor: How old is he? What is the issue?\nGuest_family: He is two. He is continuously complaining of pain in his belly and back. He is active otherwise. \nDoctor: Did you notice any change in his toilet habits or routine?\nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Any fever or chills or any other issue?\nGuest_family: No, we did not notice any such issues, he has been active and was acting very normal otherwise.\nDoctor: Any change in his eating habits?\nGuest_family: No, he has been eating and drinking as usual. He was acting normally but we did notice a foul odor coming from his nose. He was on antibiotics after removal of that piece of cotton from his right side of nose in our previous visit here. \nDoctor: How is his nose now?\nGuest_family: He got better but now we can notice that odor from his nose again.\nGuest_family: His mother started him on the antibiotics again, whatever was remaining, we think something is still there. \nDoctor: Okay, Is there anything else like runny nose or any pain in his ear or bad throat? How about cough or congestion? Or any other issues you have noticed?\nGuest_family: No, nothing of those instead he has been active and eating and drinking normally, no other issue. \nDoctor: Is he complaining of any pain or discomfort on bowel movements? Is there any increase in the frequency of urination?\nGuest_family: Well, we can't say it for sure as he still wears diapers but we have not noticed anything abnormal.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nMr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.<|im_end|>\n"}

I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. \nGuest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?\nDoctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.\nGuest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How do you get the risk so low? \nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? \nDoctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. \nGuest_family: Okay. Let's do the surgery.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.<|im_end|>\n"}
