It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \nDoctor: Okay. \nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \nDoctor: Okay.

He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

What medical conditions do you have? \nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}

I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.\nDoctor: I see. Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.

Can you dumb it down for me?

Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Welcome back, sir! \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: Today we are following up on several neurological symptoms that you have been experiencing. \nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: What hand is your dominant hand? \nPatient: I am left handed. \nDoctor: And you are sixty three years old, right? \nPatient: That's right! \nDoctor: I would like to discuss each one of your multiple symptoms individually.\nPatient: I have this pain in my neck. \nDoctor: Is the neck pain a new symptom? \nPatient: No. I have had this pain for. Oh, maybe fifteen years. At least. \nDoctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same? \nPatient: It is worse right now. \nDoctor: When did the pain become worse? \nPatient: I don't know. It has been getting more painful since it started. Little by little. \nDoctor: Where is the pain? \nPatient: It's in my neck. \nDoctor: Can you show me where the pain in the neck is coming from?\nPatient: It is coming from this area right here. \nDoctor: Right at the base of the neck then? \nPatient: Yeah, I guess. \nDoctor: What does the pain feel like? \nPatient: It hurts.\nDoctor: Mean is the pain sharp or dull? \nPatient: It is sharp. \nDoctor: Okey. Do you have any problems with your mobility? \nPatient: Yes. I am a bit unsteady on my feet. I walk like a duck. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? \nPatient: It had been a few years. \nDoctor: Has it become worse over that time? \nPatient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns today? \nPatient: I have been dropping things. \nDoctor: What do you mean dropping things? \nPatient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\nPatient: Some radiation. \nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

What brings you to the emergency room? \nPatient: I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \nDoctor: Which side left or right?\nPatient: I think its left. \nDoctor: For how long?\nPatient: I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too. \nDoctor: Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: What about your bowel movements?\nPatient: Nope everything is as usual. \nDoctor: Any change in urinary habits?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: Any changes in your skin?

He had gone to an outside clinic the day prior to presentation complaining of weakness and fatigue. Labs drawn there revealed a potassium of 7.0 and he was told to come here for further evaluation. At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.  She had received fluid rehydration.<|eot_id|>"}

She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.

At first, I ignored everything but now It feels like I am not myself any more with all these mood swings.\nDoctor: Do you work?\nPatient: Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals.\nDoctor: How are you doing at work with your mood swings?\nPatient: Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues.\nDoctor: Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?\nPatient: Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket. \nDoctor: Do you know what you were diagnosed with?\nPatient: It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again. \nDoctor: Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?\nPatient: Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket. \nDoctor: Have you ever been on antidepressants?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any hot flashes or night sweat? Did you ever find yourself waking up to wet bed due to sweating?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Just putting together all that you have told me here. You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?\nPatient: Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. Anything else that I should be aware of?\nPatient: Oh yeah, the insomnia, I am hardly sleeping. At times I feel like a zombie. \nDoctor: Any surgeries in the past?\nPatient: Yeah, I had some complications and they had to remove my complete uterus along with tubes and ovaries.\nDoctor: Oh! When was this?\nPatient: In the December of two thousand and three.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 50-year-old female comes to the clinic with complaint of mood swings and tearfulness.  This has been problematic over the last several months and is just worsening to the point where it is impairing her work.  Her boss asks her if she was actually on drugs in which she said no.  She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications.  The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication.  She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past.  She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats.  She underwent TAH with BSO in December of 2003.<|eot_id|>"}

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm just feeling lightheaded.\nDoctor: Is it happening after anything special you are doing? What symptoms are you witnessing?\nPatient:  Whenever I'm trying to change my positions like standing from sitting or getting up from the bed it is happening. Normally sitting back down helps. But it is not completely gone for like fifteen to thirty minutes. I feel very shaky and weak.\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications for that?\nPatient: Ah yes, I was taking lorazepam, but it did not help with the sensation.\nDoctor: Anything else going on?\nPatient: Um, my blood pressure was up so they increased my dose of metoprolol for it. They think all these symptoms are because of the increased dose. I just wanted to check in with you as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance.  He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.  He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.  It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.  It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.<|eot_id|>"}

Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.<|eot_id|>"}

What happened?\nGuest_family: He was playing at the park and thought it was a good idea to jump off the swing. Crazy kid, right? \nDoctor: It happens. Live and you learn, as they say. Do you have any information from the E R visit.\nGuest_family: I gave it to the nurse. Did you not get it?\nGuest_clinician: Sorry. I got really busy, but here is the report. \nDoctor: Could you read it to me, please?\nGuest_clinician: Of course. So, their son severely injured his left distal humerus. No problems were claimed before the injury. The E R saw him for his deformed elbow. \nDoctor: Are there any exams on the report? \nGuest_clinician: There is an x ray and physical exam. They both confirmed a closed type three supracondylar fracture of his left distal humerus with severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with major ecchymosis in the same region. He did have a radial pulse palpable\nDoctor: Thank you, nurse. Mom, were you there before his surgery? \nGuest_family: My husband and I were. My husband rushed from this cultural event he had planned. \nDoctor: I see. What do you all identify as?\nGuest_family: We identify as white. \nDoctor: I see. I'm going to perform a neurological exam on your son now. Hi buddy. Is it fine if I do a quick exam? \nPatient: Sure. \nDoctor: Thanks. It'll be quick.  \nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: After doing the exam I see his ulnar, median, and radial nerves are intact.

He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.<|eot_id|>"}

I have some good news for you, there's no gross deformity in this ankle.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly? \nDoctor: I don't see any ankle dislocation, which is good. \nPatient: Oh, that's good news. \nDoctor: Have you had your x rays taken yet?\nPatient: Yeah, the tech just brought me back. \nDoctor: Great, let me pull them up here. Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus. \nPatient: Which bone is that?\nDoctor: That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region. \nPatient: What are we going to do about this? \nDoctor: Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?\nPatient: No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall. \nDoctor: Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. \nPatient: Why is that?\nDoctor: There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death. \nPatient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?\nDoctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean. \nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia.\nPatient: Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.

An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.<|eot_id|>"}

In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\nPatient: Yes, I do. \nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \nPatient: Yes, it is. \nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \nGuest_family: What should we do?\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.\nGuest_family: O R I F? What's that\nDoctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. \nGuest_family: Will this not heal on its own? \nDoctor: No, we need to do the surgery. \nGuest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How is this possible?\nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: Will she be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?\nDoctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely.

After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|eot_id|>"}

I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.<|eot_id|>"}

These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nErosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.   I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm fifty two years old. \nDoctor: My nurse says that you're here for an independent evaluation, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir, that is. \nDoctor: Good, what do you do for a living? \nPatient: Right now, I'm a temporary employee for A B C A B C, I've worked for A B C D, too. \nDoctor: What do you do there?\nPatient: Mainly, I handle the loading and unloading of furniture and appliances for people's houses. \nDoctor: That's hard work. When did you get hurt? \nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \nDoctor: What did they do for you?\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \nDoctor: Did this help at all?\nPatient: No, not at all. \nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \nDoctor: When did you see them? \nPatient: That was back in April. \nDoctor: What did they recommend? \nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\nPatient: It's really on my right. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\nPatient: Really, no, it did not.

The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

Have you been taking anything for the pain? I remember you were having problems with your lower back the last time you were here. Did you get a chance to see the orthopedist?

Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. \nDoctor: When was that?\nPatient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. \nDoctor: Is that when you had the last injections? \nPatient: Correct. \nDoctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?\nPatient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. \nDoctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?\nPatient: Yes, it still hurts. \nDoctor: What makes the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. \nDoctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?\nPatient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. \nDoctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? \nPatient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet.

She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.

What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. \nDoctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?\nPatient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.\nDoctor: Are you having any back pain? \nPatient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.\nDoctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? \nPatient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. \nDoctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?\nPatient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.\nDoctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?\nPatient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.\nDoctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?\nPatient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. \nDoctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \nDoctor: Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|eot_id|>"}

I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. \nGuest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?\nDoctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.\nGuest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How do you get the risk so low? \nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? \nDoctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. \nGuest_family: Okay.

This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.

He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the \"bad crowd\" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.

Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty. \nGuest_family: Where should that be normally?\nDoctor: He should be able to get to ninety. \nGuest_family: What can we do about this? \nDoctor: I think we should do surgery on this leg.

Can I see?  \nGuest_family: Well, just look at him. \nDoctor: Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking. \nGuest_family: Can we correct that instead of the hamstring tightness? \nDoctor: Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well. \nGuest_family: Okay, right now we want to do surgery to fix his walking. What are the risks of infection?\nDoctor: They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. \nGuest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. \nGuest_family: Yes, we'd like to do the procedure.

Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.

I skipped the Ixempra on the first and eighth days. \nDoctor: How did they respond once this happened? \nPatient: They just reduced the dose I was given. \nDoctor: How did you handle this reduced dose? \nPatient: Honestly, I've been tolerating the treatment pretty well. I only have some neuropathy. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns of note? \nPatient: Um, I thought that I had a perforated septum earlier this month, and I went to my E N T right away, but everything was okay. There was no perforation. \nDoctor: Okay, so, you're here for your eighth day of Ixempra, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nShe is a very pleasant 59-year-old nurse with a history of breast cancer.  She was initially diagnosed in June 1994.  Her previous treatments included Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin.  She was found to have disease progression first noted by rising tumor markers.  PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502.  She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin.  She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle.  The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8.  She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy.  Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum.  She was seen by ENT urgently.  She was found to have nasal septum intact.  She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.<|eot_id|>"}
