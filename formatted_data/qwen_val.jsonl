Can you confirm your age?\nPatient: Fifty eight. I feel like my balance is off, and I've been feeling tired and weak. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this? \nPatient: It's been going on for six to eight weeks. \nDoctor: I see. Did you feel any other symptoms? \nPatient: I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started. \nDoctor: Interesting. Did you take any medication for that? \nPatient: I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right? \nPatient: Yeah, that's right. \nDoctor: How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics? \nPatient: Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened? \nPatient: I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall. \nDoctor: How high were you when you fell?\nPatient: I think I was three or five feet high when I fell. \nDoctor: Did you fall on your back?\nPatient: No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back.  \nDoctor: Funny. Did anything hurt after your fall?\nPatient: Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back. \nDoctor: Did you always have that pain? \nPatient: No, I haven't. It comes and goes. \nDoctor: Have you done anything to treat it? \nPatient: I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back. \nDoctor: I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this? \nPatient: No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor. \nDoctor: Okay. So, it wasn't the result of the adjustments. Is there anything else that may have caused it? \nPatient: I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper. \nDoctor: It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?\nPatient: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication. \nDoctor: I see. I have one more question. Do you have any trouble controlling your bowel movements or attempting to go to the bathroom? \nPatient: Nope. I feel like I'm able to go to the bathroom whenever I want.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThis is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.<|im_end|>\n"}

It also explains your pain in the middle part of your hand as it's caused due to pinching or compression of a nerve called median nerve. \nPatient: Oh, how did that happen?\nDoctor: Well, it's possible that your repetitive hand motion could have caused it or sometimes it's just the anatomy of your wrist. \nPatient: Oh, that explains my increased pain in the night after work. \nDoctor: Yeah. \nPatient: Anything else came in the neuro test? \nDoctor: No, rest of your neurological exam was normal. \nPatient: Okay.

In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them.  He is JAK-2 positive.  He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health. At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped. The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.<|im_end|>\n"}

What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh.

I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|im_end|>\n"}

It began while I was working in construction. \nDoctor: How old are you now? \nPatient: I'm thirty two now, so I've been in pain since I was in my twenties. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this, or am I the first? \nPatient: Yeah, um, I've actually seen several doctors before, the last I saw was Doctor A B C a few weeks ago.\nDoctor: What did those doctors tell you?\nPatient: They thought it was low back pain, and something called, um, radiculopathy. \nDoctor: Does your pain radiate into your legs? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor:  Has your pain been present for the eight years, or did it come and go? \nPatient: It's been persistent, and I've had difficulties on and off since then. \nDoctor: Okay. The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you? \nPatient: He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery.\nDoctor: Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested? \nPatient: Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that. \nDoctor: I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?    \nPatient: Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to. \nDoctor: Besides the pain medication, have you had anything else? \nPatient: I've taken antibiotic steroids before. \nDoctor: Okay. Do you drink? \nPatient: Yes, a lot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 32-year-old male seen by Dr. ABC several weeks ago for persistent left hip pain.  He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip.  He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated.  He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy.  He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking.  He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain.  He has had difficulties on and off ever since then.  On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head.  He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.  He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip.<|im_end|>\n"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nDoctor: Okay I am looking at you for multiple issues today. One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.\nDoctor: How old are you, miss?\nPatient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. \nDoctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?\nPatient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year.\nDoctor: Ok let's look at your labs.\nPatient: So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up.\nDoctor: Any other complaints?\nPatient: I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.\nDoctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.\nDoctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?\nPatient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.\nDoctor: What work you do?\nPatient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up.\nDoctor: Okay that's okay.\nPatient: I need cholesterol check right?\nDoctor: Yes, you do, but all the other labs are normal.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.<|im_end|>\n"}

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|im_end|>\n"}

I am Doctor Jones, sir. \nPatient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|im_end|>\n"}

Do you have any problems with your mobility? \nPatient: Yes. I am a bit unsteady on my feet. I walk like a duck. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? \nPatient: It had been a few years. \nDoctor: Has it become worse over that time? \nPatient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns today? \nPatient: I have been dropping things. \nDoctor: What do you mean dropping things? \nPatient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|im_end|>\n"}
