After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.  She had received fluid rehydration.<|eot_id|>"}

I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.<|eot_id|>"}

Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. \nDoctor: What eyelid was drooping? \nPatient: I don't remember? \nDoctor: What is your dominate hand? \nPatient: I am right handed. \nDoctor: And how old are you? \nPatient: I am sixty seven. \nDoctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?\nPatient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.<|eot_id|>"}

She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}

I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. \nDoctor: Are you able to do any activities?\nPatient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. \nDoctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. \nPatient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?\nDoctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.

Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good.

She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

I feel very shaky and weak.\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications for that?\nPatient: Ah yes, I was taking lorazepam, but it did not help with the sensation.\nDoctor: Anything else going on?\nPatient: Um, my blood pressure was up so they increased my dose of metoprolol for it. They think all these symptoms are because of the increased dose. I just wanted to check in with you as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance.  He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.  He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.  It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.  It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.<|eot_id|>"}

Is this your mother? \nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, this is my mom. \nDoctor: Great, please, give me some background information on your history. \nPatient: Well, I used to live here in the city when I went to college, but I wanted to get away from a bad crowd, so I came back to live with my mom. \nDoctor: What do you mean, bad crowd? \nPatient: Well, I got addicted to drugs out there, and I used to inject heroin. \nDoctor: Did you see a doctor for this addiction? \nPatient: Yeah, I saw another doctor in the city. \nDoctor: How did they treat you at that time? \nPatient: They prescribed me methadone for a while. \nDoctor: Did that help at all?\nPatient: Honestly, no, it didn't help at all. \nDoctor: Do you remember the dosage that you were given? \nPatient: Um, it was ten M G. \nDoctor: How long did you take methadone for? \nPatient: Um, it was for three or four months. \nDoctor: Did you ever try to decrease your dosage? \nPatient: Yeah, um, I tried to wean off it for a while, but I was never really successful. \nDoctor: Have you been using heroin since? \nPatient: Um, yeah, I've been using it occasionally. \nDoctor: Were you roommates at school using drugs? \nPatient: Yeah, so it's hard to get away from the stuff, it was all over the house. \nGuest_family: Well, he can now, especially because he lives with me. \nDoctor: Good, when was the last time you used heroin? \nPatient: Um, it's been about eight days now. \nDoctor: Good, congratulations. When was the last time you had methadone? \nPatient: Um, it's been about a week for that now, too. Am I able to get more today?\nDoctor: We can discuss that. Have you had any feelings of depression recently? \nPatient: Yeah, I feel down and sad a lot. \nDoctor: What about your energy? \nPatient: I really don't have much. \nDoctor: What about your enthusiasm for the foods or activities you enjoy? \nGuest_family: He hasn't had much enthusiasm for anything, either. \nDoctor: Are you having any suicidal or homicidal thoughts or actions at this time?\nGuest_family: No, nothing like that, doctor. \nDoctor: Good, what about delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thoughts or behaviors? \nPatient: No, nothing like that either, doctor. \nDoctor: Do you have any medical conditions in the past that I should know about? \nPatient: No, not that I know of. \nGuest_family: No, he hasn't been treated for anything before, doctor. \nDoctor: You completed your family and social history earlier with the nurses, is there anything you want to add to that? \nPatient: No, everything there is complete. \nDoctor: Do you have any allergies? \nPatient: No, I don't have any. \nDoctor: Good, and do you take any medications right now? \nPatient: No, doctor. I don't take anything. \nDoctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?\nPatient: I voluntarily donated my left kidney.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the \"bad crowd\" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.<|eot_id|>"}

One of my buddies was telling me about this medicine called Clantix or something like that. \nDoctor: Yes, I've heard of Chantix. We can look into it and see what's best fit. \nPatient: Okay, great. Since moving back home, I've ran out of Xanax. \nDoctor: How long have you been taking it? \nPatient: Almost a year now.

I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. \nGuest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?\nDoctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.\nGuest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How do you get the risk so low? \nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? \nDoctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  \nGuest_family: What are the rest of the risks?\nDoctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.

This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.

I'll go see her now. \nGuest_clinican: No problem. \nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?\nPatient: I wanted to see if I could get some treatment for my pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you having? \nPatient: I feel like it's a burning feeling?

Where do you feel the pain? \nPatient: I feel it mostly on my lower right side of my back. \nDoctor: Do you feel it anywhere else? \nPatient: The back of my right leg and knee. \nDoctor: Would you said the pain radiates down from your back to your knee? \nPatient: That's it. Radiating. I forgot the word. \nDoctor: No problem.

Let me know what you feel. \nPatient: I feel like the bottom is numb. Ouch. It also feels sharp at times too. \nDoctor: I see. The nurse stated here that you had some pain spreading to your mid back too. Let me feel it really quick. Let me know how that feels. \nPatient: Ouch! It hurts a lot. I feel a sharp and dull pain.

When do you feel like the pain in your body gets the worst? \nPatient: I'd say when I'm sitting in a car for a long time.\nDoctor: So, just sitting for long periods of time?\nPatient: Yeah.

She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.

I tried out Allegra last summer, but I don't know if it was doing its job. I tried it again two weeks ago because my allergies were getting bad, but it still didn't work. \nDoctor: I see.

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|eot_id|>"}

Your medial, or inside part of the knee, looks much better comparatively, but there's still some arthritis. \nPatient: Okay, thank you. \nDoctor: Are you able to flex and extend the knee all the way?\nPatient: Yes, look. \nDoctor: Can I test your stability?

She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this.  They were performed by myself.  She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.  There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively.<|eot_id|>"}

My neck is hurting so much. I can't take it anymore. \nDoctor: It looks like you had cervical spondylosis. You were evaluated fifteen years ago for it, correct? \nPatient: Cervical what? Can you dumb it down for me? I remember getting checked for something fifteen years ago, but I forgot what it was. \nDoctor: It's like a degenerative disease that softens the tissue between the vertebras in your neck. \nPatient: Is that why my neck is hurting?

Has she been to P T?\nGuest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. \nDoctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? \nGuest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. \nDoctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? \nPatient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.\nGuest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?\nDoctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. \nGuest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? \nDoctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. \nGuest_family: What is that?\nDoctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. \nGuest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.\nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Will I need to go back to P T?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.\nGuest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery.

She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.<|eot_id|>"}

I was just worried if I had carpal tunnel. \nDoctor: What does a normal day look like? What is it like at work? \nPatient: I have a typical office job. I sit in front of the computer for eight hours and mostly work on a keyboard. I hardly take two coffee breaks in between and a lunch break. It is the same kind of thing I'm doing again and again every day. \nDoctor: Is it the same day or night? \nPatient: Oh, it is bad at night, how I'm sleeping. If I sleep in a certain way, then I will wake up with a lot of tingling. Then I must literally shake my hands out to get rid of this tingling. It's just-- it's all so much an it irritates me that it's affecting my mental health.\nDoctor: Is it in your whole hand or some specific fingers? \nPatient: It is mostly in my middle finger, but sometimes I also get this on the first or the second finger of my right hand. Sometimes I have pain in my thumb as well. Do you think it is arthritis? \nDoctor: I don't think so. But we can get a test done to confirm it if you want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand.  It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She does a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand.  She has some pain in her thumb as well.  She thinks that could be arthritis.<|eot_id|>"}

Did it help? \nPatient: I did some. It was helping me with my neck pain. But this right hand is still feeling weak. I feel it is difficult at times to open jars and open doors. Many times, I drop items. \nDoctor: Is it happening with both hands or one is more than the other? \nPatient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. \nDoctor: Anything else that you noticed? \nPatient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that. \nDoctor: Are you seeing anyone for that? \nPatient: Yeah, Doctor X is trying to help me, uh, with that without surgery. His methods are good it and it is helping me with my neck pain, but not hand. \nDoctor: Are you having any issues with your bowel movements? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any pain in the lower side of your back or in your legs? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any problem with walking or stability? \nPatient: Nope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.

I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.

She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: How is your pain today? \nPatient: Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it? \nPatient: I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable. \nDoctor: Is the pain localized to one area? \nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body? \nPatient: Nope.  \nDoctor: Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all? \nPatient: Not yet. \nDoctor: Any back pain?  \nPatient: Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs. \nDoctor: Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain? \nPatient: No, no pins and needles. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing stiffness in your back? \nPatient: The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.  \nDoctor: Has it impacted your sleep at all? \nPatient: Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now. \nDoctor: This accident sure did a number on you. \nPatient: No kidding. \nDoctor: You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? \nPatient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. \nDoctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, correct. \nDoctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? \nPatient: A little bit, but not much. \nDoctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? \nPatient: It's stayed more or less the same. \nDoctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? \nPatient: Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.<|eot_id|>"}

Yes, doctor. That's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, walk me through this. So, you've seen doctor X Y Z before, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.\nDoctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? \nPatient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. \nDoctor: How did you respond to the procedure? \nPatient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. \nDoctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? \nPatient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. \nDoctor: Do you remember which side it was in?\nPatient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.\nDoctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?\nPatient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. \nDoctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? \nPatient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. \nDoctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? \nPatient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. \nDoctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. \nPatient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. \nDoctor: When was that?\nPatient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. \nDoctor: Is that when you had the last injections? \nPatient: Correct. \nDoctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?\nPatient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. \nDoctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?\nPatient: Yes, it still hurts. \nDoctor: What makes the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. \nDoctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?\nPatient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. \nDoctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? \nPatient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet.

She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.

I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. \nDoctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? \nPatient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. \nPatient: My scapho- what? \nDoctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist.  However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.  He is here now for evaluation.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.  She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week.  These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.  She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.<|eot_id|>"}

I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes doctor, that's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand? \nPatient: I use my right hand for everything. \nDoctor: Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?\nPatient: I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: What were your initial symptoms? \nPatient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too. \nDoctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?\nPatient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \nPatient: That means tumor, right?\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.<|eot_id|>"}

While here she had a couple of other issues as well.  She stated that she has been having some right shoulder pain.  She denies any injury but certain range of motion does cause it to hurt.  No weakness, numbness or tingling.  As far as her diabetes she states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 100.  She has not been checking any two hours after meals.  Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these present with her.  No other issues or concerns.  Upon review of her chart it did show that she had a benign breast biopsy done back on 06/11/04 and was told to have a repeat mammogram in six months but she has never had that done so she is needing to have this done as well.<|eot_id|>"}

First we can cast it and see how he heals, generally, children heal up very well from fractures. \nGuest_family_1: That's good, we like that option more than any kind of surgery. \nDoctor: However, surgery is also an option here as well. \nGuest_family_1: Yeah, to be completely sure we fix this, I think we should opt for the surgery, what do you think, honey?\nGuest_family_2: Yes, I agree. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is very low, generally less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, and cast tightness. I would not worry about these risks.

One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.\nDoctor: How old are you, miss?\nPatient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. \nDoctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?\nPatient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year.\nDoctor: Ok let's look at your labs.\nPatient: So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up.\nDoctor: Any other complaints?\nPatient: I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.\nDoctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.\nDoctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?\nPatient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.\nDoctor: What work you do?\nPatient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up.\nDoctor: Okay that's okay.\nPatient: I need cholesterol check right?\nDoctor: Yes, you do, but all the other labs are normal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.<|eot_id|>"}

Is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir. \nDoctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now. \nDoctor: Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop. \nDoctor: Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?\nGuest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven. \nDoctor: Good, so how have you been treated for this so far? \nPatient: We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. \nGuest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. \nDoctor: Have they taken x rays yet?\nPatient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. \nDoctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. \nPatient: What, where? Can you show me?\nDoctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. \nGuest_family: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. \nGuest_family: Yes, his father agrees. We're going to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me.\nDoctor: That's good!\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. \nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: And no side effects, right?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. \nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?\nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOverall, the patient has been doing reasonably well.  She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her.  There has been a note that she is constipated. Her blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188.  I see a couple in the 150s.  However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year. She is not having problems with breathing.  No neurologic complaints or troubles.  Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.<|eot_id|>"}

Could you give me a run down on the eleven month old patient? \nGuest_clinician: The patient was presented with stage two neuroblastoma on the left when he was six weeks old. It was completely resected. It was shown not to be N Myc amplified and had some favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Great. Did he have a follow up after?\nGuest_clinician: He did. There was a second primary in his right adrenal gland. They performed a biopsy, which was consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology. \nDoctor: Did he receive any chemotherapy?\nGuest_clinician: He is now being treated with it per protocol P nine six four one and not on study. His last chemotherapy appointment was on May twenty first two thousand and seven. They used carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.\nDoctor: What did they do after chemotherapy? \nGuest_clinician: He received G C S F daily because he had neutropenia that delayed his second cycle. \nDoctor: Thank you, Nurse. I'll go talk to the mother. \nGuest_clinican: No problem, Doctor. \nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. It's nice to see you again. How is your little boy doing?\nGuest_family: Not so well. Since out last visit, he had a stuffy nose for a couple of days. \nDoctor: Is it getting worse?\nGuest_family: I think it's getting better now. It isn't as stuffy. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. Has he been sick or had any fevers?\nGuest_family: Nope. Just the stuffy nose.\nDoctor: Has he been able to eat anything?\nGuest_family: At times, he didn't want to eat. It seemed like he wasn't hungry. \nDoctor: Does he still have a reduced appetite?\nGuest_family: Not anymore. He's starting to eat again.\nDoctor: Did he have any nausea or vomiting after he ate?\nGuest_family: Thankfully, no. I would have made my husband clean up the vomit. \nDoctor: That's great. Is he able to pee and poop fine? No diarrhea, right?\nGuest_family: His poop has been solid. I haven't seen anything bad about his pee either. \nDoctor: Great. Would you be able to open his mouth for me? I just want to check if everything's fine inside. \nGuest_family: Of course. Say ah. \nPatient: Ah. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks like he's showing some symptoms of thrush again. \nGuest_family: Oh, no. Should we restart fluconazole?\nDoctor: It's just a fungal infection inside the mouth. I'll prescribe him fluconazole. It should get rid of it. \nGuest_family: Thank you so much. You all have been so helpful. My little boy is slowly getting better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected.  It was felt to be stage 2.  It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology.  In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.  He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.  He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently.<|eot_id|>"}
