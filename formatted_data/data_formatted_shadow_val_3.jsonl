Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: So let's start from the beginning.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: You're seventy nine years old, correct?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Right or left handed?\nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: Do you remember when you had your first fall? \nPatient: Hm about a year and a half ago I fell while trying to walk from my bed to the living room.\nDoctor: Did you feel lightheaded prior? \nPatient: Uh yeah I did have some lightheadedness and I was a bit confused. I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.\nDoctor: I see. Did you lose consciousness? \nPatient: No, thank goodness.\nGuest_family: He got up by himself and felt fine afterwards. The strangest thing.\nPatient: Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight. \nDoctor: Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?\nPatient: Not this time.\nGuest_family: We had to rush him to the hospital after that.\nPatient: I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\nDoctor: Got it.\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.<|eot_id|>"}

I know I have a fracture in my lower back. \nDoctor: How have you been managing this? \nPatient: Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement?\nPatient: Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain.  \nDoctor: This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete. \nPatient: What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain. \nDoctor: I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. \nPatient: What's that? \nDoctor: It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. \nPatient: Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?\nDoctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. \nPatient: How is this possible? \nDoctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. \nPatient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. \nPatient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain. \nDoctor: Awesome, I agree. Do you have control over your bladder and bowel movements? \nPatient: Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still. \nDoctor: Do you wear a brace or corset normally?\nPatient: Yes, I usually wear both. \nDoctor: Okay, last question, can you notice any weakness in your body? \nPatient: No, I'm still very strong, even at my age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty.

She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve.  Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing.  The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  She does complain of back pain.  She has been wearing a back brace and corset.  She does not have weakness.<|eot_id|>"}

Last colonoscopy was performed by Dr. X in Las Cruces 3 years ago.  At that time the patient had polyps removed from the colon, all of them were hyperplastic in nature.

Can you tell me about my diagnosis?\nDoctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.\nPatient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.

Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. \nDoctor: What eyelid was drooping? \nPatient: I don't remember? \nDoctor: What is your dominate hand? \nPatient: I am right handed. \nDoctor: And how old are you? \nPatient: I am sixty seven. \nDoctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?\nPatient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.<|eot_id|>"}

How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\nPatient: Some radiation. \nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.<|eot_id|>"}

In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\nPatient: Yes, I do. \nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \nPatient: Yes, it is. \nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \nGuest_family: What should we do?\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.\nGuest_family: O R I F? What's that\nDoctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. \nGuest_family: Will this not heal on its own? \nDoctor: No, we need to do the surgery. \nGuest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How is this possible?\nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: Will she be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?\nDoctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

He was acting normally but we did notice a foul odor coming from his nose. He was on antibiotics after removal of that piece of cotton from his right side of nose in our previous visit here. \nDoctor: How is his nose now?\nGuest_family: He got better but now we can notice that odor from his nose again.\nGuest_family: His mother started him on the antibiotics again, whatever was remaining, we think something is still there. \nDoctor: Okay, Is there anything else like runny nose or any pain in his ear or bad throat? How about cough or congestion?

They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.
