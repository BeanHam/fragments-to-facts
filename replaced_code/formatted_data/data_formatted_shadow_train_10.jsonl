I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. \nDoctor: Are you able to do any activities?\nPatient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. \nDoctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. \nPatient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?\nDoctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.  She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week.  These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.  She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.<|eot_id|>"}

It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes.

He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

What brings you to the emergency room? \nPatient: I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. \nDoctor: Did you have wet cough?\nPatient: No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better. \nDoctor: Any shortness of breath? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about while sleeping or doing something else?\nPatient: Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss.\nPatient: I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big. \nDoctor: Which side left or right?\nPatient: I think its left. \nDoctor: For how long?\nPatient: I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too. \nDoctor: Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: What about your bowel movements?\nPatient: Nope everything is as usual. \nDoctor: Any change in urinary habits?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: Any changes in your skin? Any rash? Any kind of eyesight issue?\nPatient: Nope, no changes.\nDoctor: What about pain?

He had gone to an outside clinic the day prior to presentation complaining of weakness and fatigue. Labs drawn there revealed a potassium of 7.0 and he was told to come here for further evaluation. At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.<|eot_id|>"}

That's a nice compliment for a sixty year old lady. \nDoctor: How can I help you today?\nPatient: I have these super bad headaches. Help me, please. \nDoctor: When did they start?\nPatient: I had them since I was twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Oh, wow. That long? Did you get them every day since then?\nPatient: Not every day. That's crazy. I did get them more when my husband died in nineteen ninety six. I was heartbroken. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How did the headaches feel? \nPatient: It felt like a drum in my head. \nDoctor: I haven't heard that description before. Would you say it was pulsating? \nPatient: Something like that. Yes. \nDoctor: Did you take any medication? \nPatient: Lots of it. My son wrote it on a paper so that I could give you the names. Here you go. \nDoctor: I see you were given papaverine. Did that help? \nPatient: They did. My headaches would vanish. \nDoctor: How long did you take it for? \nPatient: I think six months. My headaches stopped for a while, but they came back in two thousand and four. \nDoctor: How often would you say you get headaches now? \nPatient: I think more than before. Like one to two per week. I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours. \nDoctor: Do you take the papaverine when you feel it? \nPatient: I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.  \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever experience any problems with your vision too? \nPatient: Yes. A lot. There were zig zag lines coming out of nowhere. I thought I was going to die. \nDoctor: Oh, wow. I will do a test right now to check your vision. \nPatient: Will you use a bright pen? \nDoctor: I will. Does it give you any discomfort? \nPatient: The bright light hurts my eyes. \nDoctor: I see. I'll only do it to the side then. Just look forward for me, please. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: Are you able to see the light? \nPatient: What light? \nDoctor: It looks like you have trouble seeing things in your peripheral vision. The discomfort you experience with bright lights is also called photophobia. \nPatient: That sounds scary. Will I be fine? \nDoctor: Yeah. You don't have to worry. Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness right now? \nPatient: Now that you mentioned it, I am. \nDoctor: Have you ever fainted before? \nPatient: I think one time. My son was there to help. \nDoctor: That's good to hear. I'll write down that you experienced a syncope. Did you take any medication for this?\nPatient: I took some Russian medicine.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Are you from Russia? \nPatient: No. I'm from Ukraine. \nDoctor: That's wonderful. How did the medicine help? \nPatient: It helped me a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}

I've had this pain in my left shoulder and neck for the last year and a half.\nDoctor: I see, have these symptoms been persistent for the last year and a half? Or do they come and go?\nPatient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.\nDoctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?\nPatient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. \nDoctor: Have these symptoms progressed? \nPatient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. \nDoctor: How did your P C P handle this?\nPatient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. \nDoctor: Do you remember the results of that study?\nPatient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.\nDoctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? \nPatient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. \nDoctor: Did you have any other imagine done? \nPatient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. \nDoctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? \nPatient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. \nDoctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?\nPatient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse. \nDoctor: Okay, going back to the workouts you were doing, are you sure you can't remember anything that would have set this pain off? \nPatient: No, nothing there. \nDoctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?\nPatient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. \nDoctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?\nPatient: No, honestly every position makes it hurt.\nDoctor: Okay, and we've already done two M R I s of the neck, and I've talked about those with you, correct?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I saw another surgeon who wanted to do, um, a decompression procedure. \nDoctor: Do you want to go forward with the surgery?\nPatient: No, not really. I'm pretty reluctant to do any kind of surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\nPatient: Some radiation. \nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh.

I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|eot_id|>"}

Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \nDoctor: Was she slurring?\nGuest_family: Nope. \nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \nDoctor: How was it after that? \nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.<|eot_id|>"}

He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.  He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently.<|eot_id|>"}

Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine.

Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

It only happens in night. \nDoctor: How frequent is it? \nPatient: Around three times a week. \nDoctor: What do you do when you have these cramps? \nPatient: I try to stand and it helps me relieve some of the discomfort. I noticed my toes are kind of extended. Whenever I step on the ground, it seems to pop into place. With all these cramps, I've started having pain in my calf. Sometimes because of that I could not sleep, or it wakes me up in the night. Similar to my toes, these cramps have also started coming up in my hands. They are not that strong or frequent. They're completely random and not in the nighttime. Sometimes my thumb gets so flexed that I have to move it to bring it to the right position and to relieve the cramp. \nDoctor: Did you ever have this symptom before? \nPatient: No, not like this. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications? \nPatient: Yeah, I took an antibacterial called Bactrim around nine months ago.

I stopped those medications around six or seven years ago. \nDoctor: Why did you stop the medications? \nPatient: I could not tolerate them.

He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both feet.  These occur exclusively at night.  They may occur about three times per week.  When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort.  He notices that the toes are in an extended position.  He steps on the ground and they seem to \"pop into place.\"  He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp.  Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep. He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs.  These do not occur at night and are completely random.  He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp. He has never had any symptoms like this in the past.  He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago.  He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now.  He cannot think of any other possible contributing factors to his symptoms. He has a history of HIV for 21 years.  He was taking antiretroviral medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago.  He reports that he was unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset.  He has a CD4 count of 326.  He states that he has never developed AIDS.

It feels like everything is in my chest. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for this?\nPatient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. \nDoctor: What other problems are you having? \nPatient: My foot keeps breaking out. \nDoctor: Has this improved at all? \nPatient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. \nDoctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? \nPatient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. \nDoctor: How was this treated?\nPatient: They gave me Nizoral cream.\nDoctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.\nPatient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  \nDoctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? \nPatient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? \nDoctor: Have you ever done that before? \nPatient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. \nDoctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. \nPatient: Cool, can we do blood work, too?

He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|>"}

Well, he's about five and a half now, and he broke both the bones in his forearm in September of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did the fracture heal? Generally, children heal very well. \nGuest_family: Well, yes, until he also rebroke it about a month ago. \nDoctor: Yes, I see now, there's an ulnar nail pretty prominently visible under the skin, did he have surgery for this? \nGuest_family: Yes, about a month ago now. Should we remove the nail?\nDoctor: We'll have to, even though its early.\nGuest_family: What will we do after the nail is removed? \nDoctor: After that, we'll put him back in a cast for about another three weeks. We'll evaluate him and see how he's doing.  \nGuest_family: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks. I have not seen anything bad happen before.\nGuest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.  The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago.  The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones.  The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.  All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions. \nPatient: Sounds good to me. \nDoctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? \nPatient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. \nDoctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. \nDoctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.

He states that this began approximately one week ago when he was lifting stacks of cardboard.  The motion that he describes is essentially picking up a stack of cardboard at his waist level, twisting to the right and delivering it at approximately waist level.  Sometimes he has to throw the stacks a little bit as well.  He states he felt a popping sensation on 06/30/04.  Since that time, he has had persistent shoulder pain with lifting activities.  He localizes the pain to the posterior and to a lesser extent the lateral aspect of the shoulder.  He has no upper extremity .<|eot_id|>"}

Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?\nPatient: Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after. \nDoctor: I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\nPatient: I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise. \nDoctor: I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling.

She had an incident on fourth of June, when she lifted many objects and experienced exacerbated symptoms. She is experiencing paresthesia, weakness, and pain in her upper extremities on the right side more than the left since then. She was referred for a cervical spine M R I. \nDoctor: So, how are you feeling today? \nPatient: I'm still having all those things like pain and weakness, and I believe that everything is coming down from my neck.\nDoctor: Did you get some physical therapy? Did it help? \nPatient: I did some. It was helping me with my neck pain. But this right hand is still feeling weak. I feel it is difficult at times to open jars and open doors. Many times, I drop items. \nDoctor: Is it happening with both hands or one is more than the other? \nPatient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. \nDoctor: Anything else that you noticed? \nPatient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that. \nDoctor: Are you seeing anyone for that? \nPatient: Yeah, Doctor X is trying to help me, uh, with that without surgery. His methods are good it and it is helping me with my neck pain, but not hand. \nDoctor: Are you having any issues with your bowel movements? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any pain in the lower side of your back or in your legs? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any problem with walking or stability? \nPatient: Nope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.

Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects. I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Good morning. So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|eot_id|>"}

What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

How are you doing today? \nPatient: I hurt my left wrist again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?\nPatient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. \nDoctor: I see. How did you hurt it? \nPatient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. \nDoctor: Did it hurt before that? \nPatient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. \nDoctor: The recent injury made it worse?\nPatient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. \nDoctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? \nPatient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. \nPatient: My scapho- what? \nDoctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist.

However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.  He is here now for evaluation.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm fifty two years old. \nDoctor: My nurse says that you're here for an independent evaluation, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir, that is. \nDoctor: Good, what do you do for a living? \nPatient: Right now, I'm a temporary employee for A B C A B C, I've worked for A B C D, too. \nDoctor: What do you do there?\nPatient: Mainly, I handle the loading and unloading of furniture and appliances for people's houses. \nDoctor: That's hard work. When did you get hurt? \nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \nDoctor: What did they do for you?\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \nDoctor: Did this help at all?\nPatient: No, not at all. \nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \nDoctor: When did you see them? \nPatient: That was back in April. \nDoctor: What did they recommend? \nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\nPatient: It's really on my right. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\nPatient: Really, no, it did not. I still have the pain down my legs today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|eot_id|>"}

That was one hundred thirty six. I'm just as frustrated as you are, doctor. \nDoctor: Well, if this plateau continues, we should discontinue the phentermine. \nPatient: Why is that? \nDoctor: It shouldn't be used to maintain your weight, but only to get the weight down. So, if it's not serving that purpose, we shouldn't use it. There's no real benefit there. \nPatient: Okay, yes, I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nShe is here for a followup on her weight loss on phentermine.

She gained a pound the month before and really has not been able to get her weight any farther down than she had when her lowest level was 136.  She is frustrated with this as well.  We agree that if she continues to plateau she really should not stay on phentermine.  We would not want her to take it to maintain her weight but only to help her get her weight down, and she may have really lost any benefit from it, and she agrees. c<|eot_id|>"}

Just actively smoking that's all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHyperlipidemia, smoking history, and chest pain.  He has been, in October of last year, hospitalized.

You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it.

I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

Me and my husband have been in the States for many many years. When we first got here, we did not speak a word of English. \nDoctor: Wow! Your English is excellent now. \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: How old are you? \nPatient: I just turned seventy four last month. \nDoctor: Happy birthday! \nPatient: Thank you. \nDoctor: So, your primary care physician sent you here for possible hydrocephalus. \nPatient: Is that the water on brain thing? \nDoctor: Yes. \nPatient: Then, yes. \nDoctor: Can you tell me about the symptoms that you have been having. \nPatient: I think I have been walking funny lately. I have also been losing my balance.\nDoctor: How do you know that you have been walking funny? \nPatient: My husband noticed that I have been walking funny. He noticed it about over six months ago or so. \nDoctor: What do you notice about the way your wife's walk that has changed?\nGuest_family: She walks wider then she used to, and I noticed that she stooped over. She walks much slower than she did before. She is often losing her balance. I have noticed her touching the walls and furniture to stabilize herself. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you noticed her stabilizing herself all of a sudden? \nGuest_family: No. It has been happening more and more over the last six months or so. \nDoctor: What else have you noticed about the way she walks? \nGuest_family: I noticed that she is having trouble stepping up onto things like a scale. She seems very unbalanced. She also seems to take her time as she walks. She can't be hurried. \nDoctor: That is good that you are taking your time. Do you use any devices to assist you to get around? Like a cane or a walker? \nPatient: No. \nGuest_family: I must help her get in and out of the car. Not every time but sometimes. I am very concerned because she has been falling more and more recently.\nPatient: I have had one emergency room visit. \nDoctor: What happened that you had to go to the emergency room? \nPatient: I fell. I was walking to the bedroom. I lost my balance so I put my hand out to brace myself against the wall and my hand slipped. I fell on my wrist. \nGuest_family: She broke her wrist.\nDoctor: When did this fall happen?\nPatient: March two thousand and seven.\nGuest_family: She has fallen a few times since she broke her wrist.

Have you had any headaches? \nPatient: No. I never get headaches.\nDoctor: Aren't you lucky. \nPatient: Yes, I guess so. \nDoctor: Have you had any problems with your memory or cognitive abilities? \nPatient: I am still able to pay the bills on time. I don't feel as smart as I used to be.  I do feel like my thinking has slowed down over the last few months. \nDoctor: What is your perspective on her memory and her cognitive abilities? \nGuest_family: I have noticed some changes. She will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use to finish the sentence. \nDoctor: Has she ever had trouble finishing a sentence the in the past? \nGuest_family: No, she has always been very well spoken never has lost thoughts. \nDoctor: Have you had any fainting or vertigo episodes? \nPatient: I have not fainted. I have had some dizzy spells in the past but not recently. \nDoctor: Have you had and problems with your bowel movements? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any bladder issues or frequent urination? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Okey.

Danish is her native language, but she has been in the United States for many many years and speaks fluent English, as does her husband. With respect to her walking and balance, she states \"I think I walk funny.\"  Her husband has noticed over the last six months or so that she has broadened her base and become more stooped in her pasture.  Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself.  She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance.  She does not festinate.  Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed.  She does not need to use an assistive device.  She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car.  Recently she has had more frequent falls.  In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist.  Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls. With respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency. The patient does not have headaches. With respect to thinking and memory, she states she is still able to pay the bills, but over the last few months she states, \"I do not feel as smart as I used to be.\"  She feels that her thinking has slowed down.  Her husband states that he has noticed, she will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use as she is continuing. The patient has not had trouble with syncope.

The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

I also see that you're here for a follow up for your asthma, correct? How is your asthma? \nPatient: That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping? \nPatient: Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it. \nDoctor: You don't take it every day then? \nPatient: Nope. Only when I feel like I need to. \nDoctor: I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping? \nPatient: I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past. \nDoctor: I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it? \nPatient: I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area. \nDoctor: I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine.\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Has your urine been checked since then? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.\nPatient: I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work.\nDoctor: Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas.

Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.<|eot_id|>"}

I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. \nDoctor: Any history of surgery? \nPatient: I have a pacemaker. \nDoctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? \nPatient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms now? \nPatient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. \nDoctor: Is that your main concern? \nPatient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. \nPatient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. \nPatient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. \nDoctor: Has it been for some time? \nPatient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. \nDoctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any neck pain? \nPatient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. \nDoctor: Have you used anything for your pain? \nPatient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little.

I haven't had a proper sleep. \nDoctor: When did you get your pacemaker? \nPatient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. \nDoctor: Do you have any back pain?\nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any change in bathroom routine? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? \nPatient: No, nothing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}
