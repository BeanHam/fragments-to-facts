Following a jury trial in January 1999, County Court submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration a single count of forgery and criminal sale of a controlled substance, and defendant was convicted accordingly. Defendant\u2019s conviction thereafter was vacated upon his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.\nA second trial was held in January 2002 at which County Court submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration a single count of forgery, criminal sale of a controlled substance and, unlike the first trial, criminal possession of a controlled substance. Defendant was found guilty of forgery, but the jury announced its inability to reach a verdict on the drug counts and County Court declared a mistrial. Thereafter, defendant was retried on the drug counts and found guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 5 to 10 years on the drug counts and 2 to 4 years on the forgery count. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in submitting the criminal possession of a controlled substance count to the juries at the second and third trials. While it is clear that County Court in the first trial had discretion as to how many concurrent counts it would submit to the jury (see CPL 300.40 [3], [4]) and, further, that its failure to submit the possession count constituted a dismissal thereof (see GPL 300.40 [7]), it is equally clear that when defendant\u2019s first conviction was vacated as a result of his GPL 440.10 motion, all counts of the original indictment were preserved for retrial (see GPL 440.10 [6]). Thus, County Court was free to submit the drug possession count to the jury at the second trial and again upon retrial following the hung jury at the second trial. We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.\nHer cure, J.P., Carpinello, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal concerns a judgment from the Tompkins County Court convicting the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and forgery in the second degree, stemming from incidents in December 1998.

As part of the plea agreement, County Court expressly advised defendant that if he, among other things, failed to cooperate with the Probation Department or appear for sentencing, it could impose the maximum permissible sentence. Defendant indicated that he understood and signed a Parker admonishment to that effect (see People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141 [1982]). When defendant failed to report to the Saratoga County Department of Probation as directed, County Court issued a warrant for his arrest. Upon defendant\u2019s return to custody, a hearing was held to determine whether defendant should receive an enhanced sentence. At the conclusion thereof, County Court found that defendant indeed violated the terms of his release and thereafter sentenced him to a term of nine years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nWe affirm. County Court clearly had the right to impose an enhanced sentence (see id.). Inasmuch as defendant failed to tender a valid excuse for failing to comply with the conditions of his release, the imposition of the enhanced sentence was justified (see People v Walker, 30 AD3d 823 [2006]; People v Marshall, 25 AD3d 876, 877 [2006], Iv denied 6 NY3d 850 [2006]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contention, that the enhanced sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice, is not properly before us in light of his valid and unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hopkins, 46 AD3d 1107, 1108 [2007]; People v Marshall, 25 AD3d at 877; People v Holmes, 306 AD2d 889 [2003], Iv denied 100 NY2d 621 [2003]).\nSpain, J.P., Lahtinen, Kane and Stein, JJ., concur.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nPeters, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J), rendered August 4, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and conspiracy in the sixth degree.\nIn satisfaction of an eight-count indictment stemming from the seizure of a handgun and quantities of cocaine, marihuana and ecstacy from the residence of defendant and his codefendant, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree agreeing that his respective prison sentences would be 10 years with a term of postrelease supervision and 2 Vs to 6 years, and he waived his right to appeal. While in jail awaiting sentencing, defendant and his codefendant were caught attempting to smuggle contraband into the jail and, at sentencing on the original two counts, defendant pleaded guilty to an additional misdemeanor count in satisfaction of charges arising from that incident and also consented to an increase in the previously agreed-upon sentences for the original two counts. County Court then sentenced defendant to, among other things, concurrent terms of imprisonment of 13 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, 2Vs to 7 years on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and 30 days for the misdemeanor charge. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we note that, inasmuch as he has failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review (see People v Phillips, 41 AD3d 969, 969-970 [2007]; People v Daniels, 16 AD3d 780, 780 [2005]; People v Rich, 10 AD3d 739, 740 [2004]). In any event, if we were to address defendant\u2019s contention we would find it to be without merit. A review of the transcript of the plea allocution reveals that defendant was fully apprised of his rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty and affirmatively communicated to County Court his understanding and desire to plead guilty. Thus, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Daniels, 16 AD3d at 780; People v Rich, 10 AD3d at 740). Furthermore, in light of defendant\u2019s express denial upon questioning by County Court that coercion, force or threats played any part in his decision to plead guilty and that he declined an opportunity to speak at his sentencing hearing and made no attempt to withdraw his plea, his present assertion that he was coerced is not supported in the record before us. Additionally, we conclude that, under the present circumstances, the vague, unsubstantiated letter concerning his codefendant submitted to County Court by a nonparty following the entry of defendant\u2019s plea did not trigger a duty on the part of County Court to inquire further at defendant\u2019s sentencing into whether he was coerced (see People v Wagoner, 30 AD3d 629, 630 [2006]; People v Rich, 10 AD3d at 740; compare People v Moore, 244 AD2d 706, 706-707 [1997]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in referring to the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as a class A felony is meritless. When read in context, it is clear that County Court properly treated the weapons charge as a class D felony, as defendant\u2019s sentence of 2Vs to 7 years on that charge reflects (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00). As a result, defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and an improper sentence premised on this assertion are unavailing.\nCrew III, J.P., Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nThe letter was apparently written by a member of the community in support of a lengthy sentence for defendant\u2019s codefendant, but it contains, in passing, a claim that \u201c[defendant] pleaded guilty out of fear of [his codefendant\u2019s] father, who has been paying for [defendant\u2019s] attorney.\u201d Importantly, defendant made no such assertion before County Court and makes no such assertion to this Court. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of multiple crimes, including criminal possession of a controlled substance and possession of a weapon, following his guilty plea. Despite claims of coercion and challenges to the voluntariness of his plea, the court found that the defendant had been fully informed of his rights and had voluntarily pleaded guilty, with no evidence supporting his assertions. Additionally, the court clarified that the classification of the weapon charge was correctly treated as a class D felony, rejecting the defendant's claims of ineffective counsel and improper sentencing.</s>"}

He pleaded guilty to this charge and waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to four years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant challenges the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution as well as the severity of his sentence. A valid waiver of the right to appeal precludes a defendant from raising these claims (see People v Torres, 117 AD3d 1497, 1498 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]; People v Perry, 50 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 963 [2008]). However, the record here reveals that defendant\u2019s appeal waiver was deficient inasmuch as he was not clearly advised that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty, and County Court did not make a proper inquiry to confirm that defendant had been advised and understood the significance of the written waiver (see People v Chappelle, 121 AD3d 1166, 1167 [2014]; People v Burgette, 118 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2014]). In view of this, defendant is not foreclosed from raising these claims. Nevertheless, the record does not indicate that defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea based upon the factual insufficiency of the allocution, which he now asserts, and for this reason his claim regarding the factual sufficiency of his plea is not preserved (see People v Wasley, 119 AD3d 1216, 1216 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1048 [2014]; see also People v O\u2019Neill, 116 AD3d 1240, 1241 [2014]). The narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable inasmuch as the record does not disclose that defendant made statements casting doubt upon his guilt or negating a material element of the crime (see People v Rouse, 119 AD3d 1161, 1162-1163 [2014]; People v Pearson, 110 AD3d 1116, 1116 [2013]).\nAs for the sentence, it is neither harsh nor excessive. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record and he agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain. Consequently, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lussier, 109 AD3d 1023 [2013]; People v Rose, 79 AD3d 1365, 1367 [2010]).\nLahtinen, J.E, Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal. The court found that the waiver was deficient as the defendant was not adequately informed about its implications, allowing him to challenge the plea's factual sufficiency; however, his claims were not preserved as he did not move to withdraw his plea. Additionally, the sentence of four years in prison was deemed neither harsh nor excessive, given the defendant's criminal history and agreement to the plea deal.</s>"}

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to all charges and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, as a second felony drug offender, to seven years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on each drug conviction and one year in jail on the welfare conviction, to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claim that the third count of the superior court information\u2014charging him with welfare fraud in the fifth degree\u2014is jurisdictionally defective survives his guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Kamburelis, 100 AD3d 1189, 1189-1190 [2012]; People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d 1126, 1127 n 1 [2009]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as the information specifically refers to Penal Law \u00a7 158.05 (1) and charges that defendant \u201cdid commit a fraudulent welfare act and thereby takes or obtains public assistance benefits,\u201d it apprises defendant of the charges and is, therefore, sufficient to survive a jurisdictional challenge (see People v Kamburelis, 100 AD3d at 1189-1190; People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]).

County Court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to six years in prison followed by a period of postrelease supervision.

In addition, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and the prosecution and defense counsel agreed to a joint sentencing recommendation of 2 to 4 years in prison.

After defendant entered his guilty plea, County Court sentenced him as a predicate felony offender to SVs to 7 years in prison. He now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s main argument is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because he did not obtain the benefit of the joint sentencing recommendation. To the extent that this claim is directed at sentencing, not the voluntariness of the plea, it is precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]).\nDefendant further contends that his plea and waiver of the right to appeal were not knowing, voluntary or intelligent because they were entered in reliance on the joint sentencing recommendation.

The crime of which he was convicted is punishable by a maximum term of 5 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant, who received no promises regarding the sentence to be imposed, was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 12 years on his plea.\nDuring the plea allocution, defendant admitted that he intended to \"sell\u201d or \"distribute\u201d the cocaine.

Defendant\u2019s contention on this appeal, that the plea allocution lacked the showing of a sufficient factual basis because it did not reveal the person or persons to whom the sale or distribution was to be made or the amount of the cocaine involved, lacks merit.

In that regard, while defendant apparently at one point asked his attorney to advise the court that he wished to withdraw his plea, the court specifically questioned him on the matter prior to sentencing and defendant clearly and unequivocally indicated that he did not want to withdraw his plea but, instead, wanted to go forward with sentencing. In any event, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is without merit and the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable here (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). Defendant\u2019s allegation of coercion is belied by the transcript of the plea allocution, which demonstrates that his guilty plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\nDefendant also asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Although defendant has failed to preserve this matter for our review (see People v Henkel, 37 AD3d 873, 873 [2007]; People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]), we nevertheless note that, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated assertions, nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of his attorney and, further, defendant received a favorable plea (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 977 [2006]; People v Rodriguez, 29 AD3d 1215, 1216 [2006]).

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Chemung County, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, is affirmed. The defendant argued that his guilty plea was involuntary due to pressure from his attorney and the court, but this claim was not preserved for review since he did not move to withdraw his plea and clearly expressed a desire to proceed with sentencing. Additionally, the court found no merit in the defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, noting that he received a favorable plea and the record did not suggest any inadequacy in representation.</s>"}

He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon term of three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nPreliminarily, to the extent that defendant suggests that his plea was coerced, we need note only that defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and, hence, has not preserved this issue for our review (see People v Brown, 49 AD3d 1028 [2008]; People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1005 [2007]).

County Court denied defendant\u2019s request to be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to five years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.\nDefendant does not challenge the validity of his appeal waiver, and the plea colloquy and the written waiver demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and-sentence (see People v White, 145 AD3d 1324, 1324-1325 [2016]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]).

The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would enter into the Judicial Diversion Program and that, if he failed to complete the program, he would face a term of imprisonment to be followed by postrelease supervision. Defendant was ultimately charged with violating the terms of the program and was terminated from it after waiving his right to a hearing and admitting that he had used cocaine and lied to program officials about that usage (see CPL 216.05 [9]). County Court agreed to, and did, sentence defendant to a prison term of six years to be followed by postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we agree with defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal is invalid, as \u201che was not advised that it was a right separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty\u201d (People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). Defendant\u2019s further challenge to the voluntariness of his plea was not preserved for our review by a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, and he said nothing during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation require ment (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014]). Likewise, defendant has not preserved his argument that County Court abused its discretion in terminating him from the Judicial Diversion Program, as he admitted to violating the terms of the program in return for a specified sentence and made no effort to attack that agreement before County Court (see People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2014]).\nTurning to issues relating to defendant\u2019s sentence, we are unpersuaded that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history (see People v Cooney, 120 AD3d 1445, 1446 [2014]; People v Johnson, 12 AD3d 727, 727-728 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 745 [2004]). It is lastly evident from the record that, while County Court referred to defendant as a second felony offender at sentencing, defendant falls within a subset of that category and was actually sentenced as a second felony drug offender (see People v Whalen, 101 AD3d 1167, 1170 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013] ; compare Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b], with Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i]).

In response to County Court\u2019s inquiry, defendant indicated he understood English and then proceeded to answer appropriately the other pro forma questions County Court asked him during the arraignment. Thereafter, in paragraph 73 of an omnibus motion, defendant\u2019s attorney applied for the appointment of an interpreter or an additional counsel fluent in Spanish because defendant did not speak English well enough for him to be able to fully and adequately represent him. County Court denied the application with leave to renew for good cause shown. The application was not renewed and thereafter defendant entered into a plea bargain,\nultimately pleading guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of four years to life. This appeal ensued.\nIt is a well-established precept of due process that non-English speaking defendants in criminal actions are entitled to an interpreter so that they can meaningfully participate in the trial and assist in their own defense (see, United States v Mosquera, 816 F Supp 168, 173; People v Ramos, 26 NY2d 272, 274; People v Robles, 203 AD2d 172, 174,, revd on other grounds 86 NY2d 763). In the instant case, although the better practice would have been for County Court to hold a hearing to evaluate defendant\u2019s ability to speak and understand English, a review of the entire record reveals a 29-year-old defendant who was born in Chicago, Illinois, attended school in the Bronx through age 13 and has lived in the Bronx or Manhattan for most of his life. Further, the record discloses a presentence investigation report in which the defendant provided, with no apparent language difficulty, a detailed account of the plea bargain, his participation in the offense in question, his finances, family background, education, employment and physical condition. Thus, based on the entire record, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that he was unable to speak and understand English.\nDefendant challenges the sufficiency of his plea allocution. Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate his judgment of conviction and, accordingly, this issue raised for the first time on this appeal was not preserved for appellate review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662), and the record reveals no support for defendant\u2019s contention that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because of a lack of fluency in English (see, People v Ferrer, 158 AD2d 315).\nDefendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is also without merit. The record, viewed as a whole, reveals that defendant was represented in a competent and meaningful manner (see, People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796), and defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was deprived of a fair proceeding by less than meaningful representation (see, People v Flores, 84 NY2d .184, 187). Finally, defendant\u2019s sentence cannot be described as excessive considering that more than one pound of cocaine was involved. We find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances with defendant\u2019s sentencing and decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Kenny, 175 AD2d 404, 407, Iv denied 78 NY2d 1012).

The court found that despite the defendant's claim of inadequate English proficiency, the record indicated he understood English sufficiently to participate in the arraignment and plea process. Additionally, the court determined that the defendant received competent legal representation and that his sentence of four years to life for possessing over one pound of cocaine was appropriate and not excessive.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal by the People from a judgment of the former County Court, Kings County, rendered September 1, 1961 on defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, convicting her of attempted felonious possession of narcotic drugs (Penal Law, \u00a7 1751) and sentencing her, as a first felony offender, to serve a term of 3 years and 9 months to 7% years. Judgment reversed on the law, and action remitted to the Criminal Term, Supreme Court, Kings County for resentencing of the defendant as a second felony offender. The facts are affirmed. The court below, at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing, dismissed a second felony offender information in which it was alleged that defendant had been convicted of a prior felony in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York. Such prior conviction was based on defendant\u2019s guilty plea to an indictment which charged that she did unlawfully \u201c sell, dispense and distribute \u201d a quantity of heroin in violation of subdivision (a) of section 4704 of title 26 of the United States Code. This statute provides that it shall be unlawful to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute narcotic drugs, except in or from the original stamped package. Defendant contends that the People have no right of appeal. In our opinion, the People may appeal from this judgment of conviction, pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 518 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (People v. Washington, 278 App. Div. 967; People v. Webster, 279 App. Div. 944, affd. 304 N. Y. 621; People v. Evans, 18 A D 2d 1018). This conclusion is predicated on the fact that, since the statute grants a right of appeal to the defendant, it accords a reciprocal right of appeal to the People. It is also our opinion that the defendant\u2019s prior Federal conviction may properly be used to sentence her as a second felony offender. It is settled that a conviction, under this Federal statute, for a sale, alone, of a narcotic not in or from a tax stamped package, is to be counted a prior felony (People v. Gennaro, 261 App. Div. 533, affd. 287 N. Y. 657; People v. Lana, 10 A D 2d 646, permission to appeal to Court of Appeals den. April 25, 1960 by Judge Fuld, cert. den. 364 U. S. 832). In our opinion, the inclusion of the words \u201cdispense or distribute\u201d in the Federal indictment charged acts which would also be felonious in this State (Penal Law, \u00a7 1751, subd. 1; Public Health Law, \u00a7 3301, subds. 29, 30). Beldock, P. J., Christ, Hill, Rabin and Hopkins, JJ., concur. [/INST] The People appealed a judgment from the former County Court of Kings County that convicted the defendant of attempted felonious possession of narcotics and sentenced her as a first felony offender. The appellate court reversed the judgment, remanding the case for resentencing as a second felony offender based on the defendant's prior federal conviction for narcotics distribution, which qualified under New York law. The court affirmed that the People had the right to appeal and that the defendant's previous conviction could be considered in determining her sentencing status.</s>"}

As the result of a search of a handbag in defendant\u2019s possession at the time of the arrest, he was later indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and harassment. Defendant contested the constitutional validity of the search and, following an evidentiary hearing, County Court denied his motion to suppress.\nDefendant then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence before the Grand Jury was not legally sufficient. The day after that motion was made, and prior to the return date, the case was calendared for a conference at which time, without ruling on the motion, County Court accepted a waiver of indictment and the filing of a superior court information, charging defendant with attempted possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and harassment, upon the People\u2019s representation that they were prepared to withdraw the indictment upon the understanding that the defendant would plead guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. The court approved the waiver and accepted defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the superior court information. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of li\u00f3 to 3 years. Counsel for defendant filed a notice of appeal. Some months later defendant, acting pro se, moved to vacate the conviction and County Court denied that motion. This court granted permission to appeal from said denial.\nIt is clear that the conviction must be reversed and the superior court information dismissed. CPL 195.10 provides for waiver of indictment in a superior court at any time prior to the return of an indictment by a Grand Jury. Where an indictment has been returned for a crime arising out of the transaction for which defendant has been held for Grand Jury action, a subsequent superior court information encompassing crimes arising out of that transaction is fatally defective (People v Boston, 75 NY2d 585). While County Court advised defendant that the indictment would be dismissed upon his plea to the superior court information, nothing in the record reflects that was done. Accordingly, the case must be remitted to County Court for further proceedings on the indictment.\nIn view of our decision herein it is unnecessary for us to reach the contention of defendant that County Court erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. Were we to do so we would find that the search was constitutionally impermissible (see, People v Gokey, 60 NY2d 309).\nJudgment and order reversed, on the law, superior court information dismissed and case remitted to the County Court of Schenectady County for further proceedings on the indictment.

The defendant's arguments regarding the amendment of the indictment and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were not preserved for appeal due to his failure to oppose the amendment and his valid waiver of appeal. Additionally, the court found that the plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, rejecting claims of coercion and noting that any arguments based on outside information were more appropriate for a separate motion.</s>"}

Defendant pleaded guilty as charged with the understanding that, if she were accepted into and successfully completed the Clinton County Drug Court program, she would be placed on probation for five years with a period of community service and she would be obligated to cooperate and provide truthful testimony against certain codefendants. Defendant was thereafter accepted into the drug court program. In May 2013, upon completion of, among other things, certain inpatient and intensive outpatient treatment, and, based on the availability of a supportive living program in Albany County, County Court agreed to administratively discharge defendant from the drug court program and sentenced her to a period of five years of probation and 100 hours of community service and imposed the requisite $375 in associated fines and surcharges. Four months later, defendant was returned to County Court on a bench warrant for a violation of probation stemming from, among other things, her discharge from the supportive living program. In November 2013, defendant admitted to violating her probation and County Court revoked her probation and resentenced her to a prison term of IV3 to 4 years. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. To the extent that defendant contends that County Court erred in resentencing her without an updated presentence investigation report, such claim is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to request an updated report, raise an objection during resentencing or move to vacate the resentence (see People v Dorfeuille, 127 AD3d 1414, 1414-1415 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 928 [2015]; People v Alexander, 110 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1154 [2014]).

At a combined sentencing and plea proceeding, defendant was sentenced to two consecutive indeterminate prison terms of 3 to 9 years on the drug sale charges and, in satisfaction of two related indictments and other pending charges, he entered a plea of guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived the right to appeal not only the weapon possession conviction based on the plea but also the drug sale conviction based on the verdict at trial. He filed a notice of appeal from the judgment convicting him of the drug sale charges and was thereafter sentenced on the weapon possession charge in accordance with the plea bargain. Assigned counsel now moves to be relieved of the assignment on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues.\nIn the absence of any argument or anything in the record to suggest that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal was not knowingly and voluntarily made or that it was designed to conceal error or prosecutorial overreaching, the waiver is en forceable with regard, to both judgments of conviction (see, People v Govan, 199 AD2d 815, lv denied 83 NY2d 853), including the one from which defendant appeals.

Although a medical report of examination pursuant to section 81.19 of the Mental Hygiene Law found defendant to be a narcotics addict, and the defendant admitted to being an addict, the trial court, after a hearing, refused to make any determination as to addiction prior to sentencing. The subsequent determination of nonaddiction by the trial court after sentencing, in response to habeas corpus application, does not salvage the trial court\u2019s disregard of section 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law which mandates that a finding of addiction or nonaddiction must be made prior to sentencing.\nAs to defendant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a jury trial on the issue of addiction or nonaddiction the statute (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 81.21, subd. [a]) is equally clear \u2014 only a convicted misdemeanant who denies addiction or stands mute is entitled to a jury trial. Here, defendant has admitted he is an addict and the only purpose of a hearing is for the court to \u201c satisfy\u201d itself that the defendant is or is not an addict.

The plea was entered in exchange for a promise that, upon completion of a Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities (hereinafter TASC) program, the defendant would be sentenced to \u201cno jail [time].\u201d Otherwise, he would be incarcerated for one year followed by one year of postrelease supervision.\nThe defendant absconded and did not complete the TASC program. After he was returned to the Supreme Court, the defendant moved, in effect, to modify the terms of his 2012 plea agreement so as to condition his avoidance of imprisonment on completion of a different program, a Mental Illness and Controlled-Substance Abuse (hereinafter MICA) program. The court denied the motion and imposed the promised sentence of one year imprisonment followed by one year of postrelease supervision.\nContrary to the People\u2019s contention, the defendant\u2019s purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid. Among other things, the Supreme Court\u2019s brief oral colloquy suggested that the scope of the waiver applied only to issues concerning the legality or excessiveness of the sentence, but not the conviction itself (see People v Maracle, 19 NY3d 925 [2012]; see generally People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133 [2014]). Further, although the record reflects that the defendant executed a written appeal waiver form, the transcript of the plea proceeding shows that the court never ascertained on the record whether the defendant read the written waiver form, discussed it with counsel, or was even aware of its contents (see People v Iovino, 142 AD3d 561, 561-562 [2016]; People v Pacheco, 138 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2016]; People v Brown, 122 AD3d at 145). Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his. right to appeal (see People v Pacheco, 138 AD3d at 1036; see generally People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-267 [2011]).\nNevertheless, the defendant\u2019s contentions on appeal are without merit. The defendant argues that a TASC program was unsuitable for him and that he was unable to complete the TASC program because of a medical condition. He further argues that, after he violated the conditional plea by absconding and getting arrested twice, the Supreme Court should have placed him in the appropriate program rather than sentence him to one year imprisonment as promised. Since he already served his one-year term of imprisonment, the defendant argues that the proper remedy on appeal is a reduction of his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or vacatur of his felony conviction, and a sentence of time served.\nOther than conclusory assertions made by defense counsel, there is no evidence that the TASC program was inappropriate treatment for the defendant (cf. People v Feliciano, 14 AD3d 308, 310 [2005]) or that the defendant was unable to complete the TASC program because of a medical condition (cf. People v Jimenez, 307 AD2d 880, 881 [2003]). A psychologist\u2019s report submitted by the defendant, which contained a conclusory assertion that the defendant \u201cwould quite likely benefit from MICA treatment,\u201d was insufficient to establish that completion of a TASC program was a goal that was beyond the defendant\u2019s capacity to achieve.\nIn any event, even if the record showed that the defendant stood a better chance of completing a MICA program, as opposed to a TASC program, such circumstance would not warrant the relief requested by the defendant on this appeal, that is, to reduce his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or to vacate his felony conviction and sentence him to time served (see CPL 470.55 [2]; 220.60 [3]; People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 379, 385 n [2015]; cf.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nDefendant was charged by indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, and with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first, second and third degrees. Defendant was alleged to have sold approximately four ounces of cocaine on both November 7 and 26, 1984. On each occasion he was said to have received over $5,000 in exchange for the drug.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. On accepting the plea, the sentencing court indicated that pursuant to its agreement with the District Attorney, defendant would be sentenced to a minimum of five years and a maximum of life imprisonment.\nThe presentence report, made available to the court only subsequent to the plea, was reportedly favorable to defendant. Citing defendant\u2019s lack of criminal involvement prior to the present matter and his otherwise stable life, it recommended a more lenient sentence than the one agreed to as part of the plea bargain. At the sentencing proceeding the court indicated its desire to moderate the sentence in conformity with the presentence report recommendation. The District Attorney, however, would not consent to the proposed change in the agreement pursuant to which the plea was entered. The court, characterizing the previously agreed to sentence as \"excessive\u201d and \"overkill\u201d, nevertheless expressed the conviction that it was constrained to honor its agreement with the District Attorney. It, therefore, proceeded to sentence defendant to a five-years-to-life term of imprisonment.\nOn appeal defendant maintains, and the People concede, that the sentencing court was not bound by its agreement with the District Attorney. Sentencing is a function committed exclusively to the court\u2019s sound discretion (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 305; People v Maldonado, 70 AD2d 308). Many factors must be weighed in determining an appropriate sentence, among them the nature of the crime, the defendant\u2019s circumstances, the need for societal protection, and the prospects for the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. The consideration and balancing of these factors is ultimately the province of the court since the court alone, in the criminal justice process, is sufficiently detached from outside pressures to fairly and objectively accommodate public and private interests and so arrive at a just sentence (People v Farrar, supra, at pp 305-306).\nThe sentencing court in the instant matter was thus free and, indeed, duty bound to exercise its discretion in imposing sentence. (Supra, at p 306.) Its failure to do so was error and makes it appropriate that we remand the matter for resentencing. (Supra, at p 307.)\nUpon remand, the presentence report, unavailable when the plea was entered, is clearly relevant to the court\u2019s exercise of discretion. Also relevant, however, are the nature of the offense for which the plea was entered and the underlying conduct to which defendant has admitted. We take special note that defendant\u2019s conviction stems from his very lucrative sales of considerable quantities of cocaine. Profiting from the sale of a substance that has so ravaged our society is indeed a grave offense and we have serious question whether a proper exercise of discretion would allow moderation of the sentence agreed to by all concerned, including defendant, at the entry of the plea. Should the sentencing court decide to impose a lesser sentence than that previously agreed to as part of the plea bargain, the People should, of course, be given the opportunity to withdraw their consent to the plea. (Supra, at pp 307-308.) Concur \u2014 Murphy, P. J., Sullivan, Asch, Fein and Wallach, JJ. [/INST] The defendant was indicted on multiple drug-related charges and pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, agreeing to a five-years-to-life sentence. However, a favorable presentence report recommended a more lenient sentence, which the court felt constrained to disregard due to the plea agreement with the District Attorney. On appeal, it was determined that the sentencing court had erred by not exercising its discretion in sentencing, leading to a remand for resentencing, while noting the serious nature of the defendant's offenses and the potential for the District Attorney to withdraw consent to the plea if the sentence is lowered.</s>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMcCarthy, J.P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 8, 2014, (1) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and (2) which revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.\nIn 2009, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to five years of probation. While on probation, defendant was ar rested after allegedly selling cocaine to a confidential informant and agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in a superior court information, and to violating the terms of his probation. As part of the agreement, which purportedly included that he waive the right to appeal, defendant was to receive, as a second felony offender, an aggregate sentence of 4V2 years in prison, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant failed to appear at sentencing and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was arrested on the warrant six months later. He thereafter agreed to admit to violating a Parker admonishment in exchange for not being charged with bail jumping, with the understanding that he would now be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court thereafter revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed the agreed-upon aggregate sentence. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we agree with defendant that he did not validly waive the right to appeal. County Court failed to distinguish \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]). Moreover, although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, County Court did not \u201censure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver\u201d (People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], Iv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], Iv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]).\nDefendant also contends that his guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and violating his probation was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because County Court failed to inform him of the constitutional rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. Although this contention is unpreserved for our review, inasmuch as he failed to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Bond, 146 AD3d 1155, 1156 [2017]), we find that the error warrants reversal of the judgment in the interest of justice (see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1210 [2017]; People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]).\n\u201cWhile there is no mandatory catechism required of a pleading defendant, there must be an affirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his or her constitutional rights\u201d (People v Lowe, 133 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]; see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]). During the plea allocution, County Court merely asked whether defendant understood \u201cwhat the attorneys have told me about you waiving your rights and entering pleas of guilty to a felony, violation of probation and all of that stuff\u201d and whether defendant had \u201c[a]ny questions at all regarding you giving up your rights to a jury trial, your rights to presumption of innocence, your rights to a violation of probation hearing, anything like that.\u201d County Court further failed to ascertain whether defendant had discussed with counsel the trial-related rights being waived by a guilty plea or its constitutional consequences. Rather, County Court simply inquired whether defendant \u201c[had] the time, and did you talk to [counsel] regarding this case, the disposition, and anything else that is important to you, with respect to these charges\u201d (see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1210; People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245). Additionally, County Court did not advise defendant of his rights or the consequences regarding an admission to violating probation (see People v Bryant, 262 AD2d 791, 791 [1999]), including that he understood that he was entitled to a hearing on the issue and that he was waiving that right (compare People v Crowell, 119 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2014], Iv denied 24 NY3d 1083 [2014]; People v Diaz, 26 AD3d 644, 645 [2006], Iv denied 7 NY3d 755 [2006]). \u201cWith no affirmative showing on the record that defendant understood and waived his constitutional rights when he entered the guilty plea, the plea was invalid and must be vacated\u201d (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1210 [citations omitted]; see People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245-1246).

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of 3/2 years to be followed by an undisclosed period of postrelease supervision.

Thereafter, defendant was apprehended and sentenced to a prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision.

Here, defendant contends and the People concede that, although a negotiated sentence was a part of the plea agreement, defendant was not properly advised of the specific duration of mandatory postrelease supervision prior to his sentencing.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nGarry, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered March 13, 2014, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of grand larceny in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn 2013, defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts of grand larceny in the third degree related to her receipt of unemployment benefits to which she was not entitled. Subsequently, a second indictment stemming from a separate incident charged her with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant plead guilty to one count of grand larceny in the third degree and one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived her right to appeal. She was then sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 1 to 3 years on the grand larceny count and three years on the criminal sale of a controlled substance count, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision (hereinafter PRS). Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant failed to preserve her argument that she was not arraigned on the charges of grand larceny in the third degree, in violation of CPL 180.10 (see People v Hallenbeck, 81 AD3d 1077, 1078 [2011]). To the extent that this argument implicates County Court\u2019s jurisdiction, defendant consented to such jurisdiction through her subsequent appearance and entry of a plea (see People v Miller, 27 AD3d 1017, 1018 [2006]; People v Golston, 13 AD3d 887, 889 [2004], lv denied 5 NY3d 789 [2005]; People v Roberts, 6 AD3d 942, 943 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 662 [2004]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations in the indictments is similarly unpreserved for our review and waived by her guilty plea (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1024 [2013]; People v Brown, 75 AD3d 655, 656 [2010]). In any event, the indictments, as amplified by the People\u2019s responses to County Court\u2019s discovery orders, provided defendant with \u201csufficient notice of the accusations against [her] to enable [her] to prepare a defense\u201d (People v Perez, 93 AD3d 1032, 1035 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]).\nFinally, the record belies defendant\u2019s argument that she was not adequately apprised that her sentence would include a period of PRS. Defendant was informed during the plea proceedings that, in exchange for her plea, she would receive a sentencing recommendation that would include, as is relevant here, two years of PRS. County Court further advised her that if she accepted the plea, she faced a maximum possible prison sentence of nine years that would include two years of PRS. Defendant failed to object to the imposition of PRS, either during the plea proceedings in January 2014 or at her subsequent sentencing in March 2014, nor did she move to withdraw her plea by a postallocution motion. Thus, as defendant had knowledge of the PRS component of her plea and an \u201cample opportunity to raise an objection\u201d prior to the imposition of the sentence, her failure to do so renders her contention unpreserved for our review (People v Crowder, 24 NY3d 1134, 1136-1137 [2015]; see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Medina, 129 AD3d 1385, 1386 [2015]).\nPeters, P.J., Egan Jr., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Appeal unanimously dismissed. Memorandum: After defendant was indicted on nine counts of drug-related activity, the court, with the People\u2019s agreement, accepted defendant\u2019s plea to attempted first degree criminal sale of a controlled substance in exchange for the promise of a sentence of three years to life. The parties and the court mistakenly assumed that first degree attempted criminal sale is an A-II felony. In fact, it is an A-I felony carrying a minimum sentence of 15 years to life. After the mistake was discovered but before sentencing, defendant was permitted to withdraw his plea to attempted first degree criminal sale. Defendant then asserted that he was entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement, i.e., that he was entitled to plead guilty to an A-II felony in exchange for a sentence of three years to life. The People opposed that relief, arguing that defendant was not entitled to specific performance because he had not changed his position in detrimental reliance on the plea agreement. They also withdrew their plea offer, informing the court that new information concerning defendant\u2019s criminal activities prevented them from offering a plea to less than an A-I felony.\nThe court found that defendant had detrimentally relied on the plea agreement and was entitled to specific performance. Thus, without the People\u2019s consent, the court accepted defendant\u2019s plea to second degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and sentenced defendant to three years to life. The People now attempt to appeal from that judgment.\nAn appeal by the People does not lie in these circumstances. The People\u2019s authority to appeal to an intermediate appellate court in a criminal case is strictly the product of statute (see, People v Ainsworth, 145 AD2d 74, 76, lv granted 74 NY2d 660, appeal withdrawn 74 NY2d 894; People v Garofalo, 71 AD2d 782, appeal dismissed 49 NY2d 879, adhered to on rearg 75 AD2d 980). That authority is set forth in its entirety in CPL 450.20. Because the conviction and sentence in this case is not an order, judgment, or sentence of the type enumerated in CPL 450.20, the People\u2019s appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Shortly thereafter, she was permitted to continue on probation even though she had apparently violated its terms. In December 2002, however, defendant was charged in a second petition with violating the terms of her probation after she tested positive for cocaine use on five occasions and falsely reported to her probation officer that she was employed full time. Defendant admitted to the allegations contained in the petition and waived her right to a hearing. Although it was established that defendant would receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison as a result of the violation, defense counsel requested County Court to consider medical evaluations and permit defendant to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment before imposing sentence. County Court agreed. Sentencing was thereafter repeatedly adjourned over the course of the ensuing nine months. During this time, defendant missed appointments with her probation officer as well as sessions in her outpatient rehabilitation program, resulting in her discharge, and forged a note from her doctor. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant to the 2 to 6-year prison term originally agreed to as part of the plea.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s history of drug use and demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the terms of her probation despite having been given many opportunities to do so over the course of a long period of time suggests that incarceration is the appropriate alternative. This, together with the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea agreement, leads us to conclude that there are neither extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Thompson, 4 AD3d 626, 627 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 649 [2004]; People v Murphy, 257 AD2d 766, 767 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 876 [1999]).\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Carpinello, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The County Court of Broome County revoked the defendant's probation and imposed a 2 to 6-year prison sentence after she admitted to multiple probation violations, including drug use and false reporting. Although the defendant argued that the sentence was harsh, the appellate court affirmed the judgment, citing her history of noncompliance and the absence of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the sentence.</s>"}

Following the denial of her application requesting judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of both indictments. Defendant also waived her right to appeal all challenges other than constitutional issues or a violation of County Court\u2019s sentencing commitment in connection with the plea. Thereafter, in accord with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of five years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court also directed defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $430, along with a 10% collection surcharge. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s valid waiver of her right to appeal precludes her claim that County Court should have granted her application for judicial diversion (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013] , lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]; People v Roche, 106 AD3d 1328, 1329 [2013]). Although her waiver does not preclude her challenge to the amount of restitution to be awarded, inasmuch as the plea agreement did not specify the amount or if restitution would definitely be awarded (see People v Ortolaza, 120 AD3d 843, 844 [2014]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 970 [2014] ), the issue is unpreserved because defendant did not request a hearing or otherwise challenge the award of restitution at sentencing, and corrective action in the interest of justice is unwarranted (see People v Ortolaza, 120 AD3d at 844; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).\nPeters, EJ., Garry, Rose and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

The defendant's waiver of her right to appeal limited her ability to contest the denial of her application for judicial diversion, and her challenge regarding the restitution amount was deemed unpreserved since she did not raise it at sentencing. Consequently, the court upheld the five-year prison sentence followed by two years of post-release supervision, along with a restitution order of $430.</s>"}

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Duskas, J.), rendered September 5, 1980, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. The defendant raises on this appeal the issue of the deprivation of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. The record discloses that defendant had been originally indicted on three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, each of which was a class D felony punishable by an indeterminate term of seven years. His defense counsel was able, through plea negotiations, to substantially limit defendant\u2019s exposure to imprisonment by a negotiated plea to a lesser crime in full satisfaction of all counts. The mere fact that counsel did not engage in some pretrial procedures available to defendant, in itself, does not indicate ineffective assistance of counsel. The strength of the People\u2019s case may very well have made such efforts futile. The defendant has not successfully demonstrated inadequacy of his counsel or that counsel\u2019s handling of the case was detrimental to defendant. The unsupported conclusory assertions of defendant to the contrary are ineffective to support his contention. The record on the other hand, indicates that defense counsel\u2019s handling of the predicate felony hearing was that of a knowledgeable and capable advocate. Accordingly, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention. Defendant next contends that his prior felony conviction was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and, therefore, should not have been the predicate for his sentence as a second felony offender. The burden of proving this contention reposes on defendant. The record is woefully devoid of credible evidence to establish the contention raised. Finally, defendant raises the question of the appropriateness of the sentence as a second felony offender. The court was required by law to impose a minimum sentence. The maximum imposed was lenient in view of the transgression. We find nothing in the sentence as would indicate that it is harsh or invalid. Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P.J., Sweeney, Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., and Weiss, JJ., concur. [/INST] The County Court of St. Lawrence County affirmed the conviction of the defendant for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, rejecting his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the illegality of his prior felony conviction. The court found no merit in the defendant's assertions, noting that his counsel successfully negotiated a plea that reduced his potential sentence and that the evidence did not support his claims regarding his prior conviction. Additionally, the court deemed the imposed sentence appropriate and not harsh under the law.</s>"}

In satisfaction of all charges, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the second count of the indictment, which charged criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon the understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea and, after a hearing, County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon term. Defendant appeals.\nDuring the plea allocution, defendant declared that his plea was voluntary, acknowledged his understanding of the rights he was waiving and admitted that while acting in concert with two codefendants, he knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully possessed cocaine with intent to sell it. Defendant thereafter explained that he did not actually sell any drugs, but when County Court began to question defendant about his guilt of the criminal possession charge, defense counsel requested and received time to speak with his client, after which defendant reaffirmed the truth of his prior acknowledgments and admissions and reiterated his guilty plea. At the subsequent hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant stated that he did not want to accept the plea bargain because \u201cI don\u2019t feel I should get the same or more than the man who was really running the business\u201d. We find no error in County Court\u2019s acceptance of the plea and denial of the motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Murphy, 243 AD2d 954, lv denied 91 NY2d 835).\nConsidering the record as a whole, including the advantageous plea bargain whereby defendant avoided a possible sentence of SVs years to life in prison on the top count of the indictment, it is clear that defendant received meaningful representation (see, People v Loomis, 256 AD2d 808, lv denied 93 NY2d 854). And, as defense counsel effectively argued the motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 941) County Court cannot be faulted for failing to appoint new counsel to pursue the motion (see, People v Davis, 246 AD2d 931, 932, lv denied 91 NY2d 1006). Lastly, given the advantageous plea bargain, whereby defendant was allowed to pleaded guilty to one count in satisfaction of a seven-count indictment and received less than the harshest sentence possible, there is no basis to disturb the sentence (see, People v Evans, 193 AD2d 960, 961).\nCardona, P. J., Mikoll, Crew III and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal involves a defendant convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after pleading guilty to a reduced charge from a seven-count indictment related to cocaine sales.

Because the minimum sentence he received, two years, was \u201dno[t] more than one-third of the maximum term imposed\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [b]), the sentence was in all respects legal.

The court also imposed fines totaling $8,000 under Indictment No. 126/14, and $4,000 under Indictment No. 41/14. The appeals bring up for review the denial of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion to suppress physical evidence.\nOrdered that the judgment under Indictment No. 41/14 is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that the sentences imposed for the convictions under counts one through four that indictment shall run concurrently with the sentences imposed for the convictions under counts one through four of Indictment No. 126/14; as so modified, the judgment under Indictment No. 41/14 is affirmed; and it is further,\nOrdered that the judgment under Indictment No. 126/14 is affirmed.\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the County Court did not err in denying so much of his omnibus motion as sought a hearing to controvert the search warrant, as he failed to make \u201cthe requisite preliminary showing that the affidavit in support of the warrant contained false statements\u201d (People v Moshier, 110 AD3d 832, 833 [2013]; see People v McGeachy, 74 AD3d 989, 990 [2010]; People v Tordella, 37 AD3d 500 [2007]).

In any event, any error in this regard was harmless: apart from the challenged evidence, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt and no reasonable possibility that any such error contributed to the conviction (see People v Lewis, 23 NY3d 179, 189 [2014]; People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 241-242 [1975]; People v Olsen, 148 AD3d 829 [2017]).\nThe defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation remark that he now challenges as improper.

County Court would not agree to the plea premised on this sentence and required that defendant be sentenced to 3 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant agreed to this plea arrangement and subsequently pleaded guilty, with County Court imposing the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant now contends that County Court failed to exercise its discretion in agreeing to a determined sentence before considering defendant\u2019s presentencing report, that County Court erred in considering unreliable information in the presentence report and that the sentence is harsh and excessive.\nWe find that County Court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing defendant. Nothing in the record indicates that County Court felt constrained to acquiesce to the People\u2019s plea offer. To the contrary, County Court found that it could not agree to the People\u2019s offer and made its own offer based upon the circumstances of the case known at that time, including defendant\u2019s criminal record. Further, County Court accepted the plea conditioned upon defendant\u2019s acceptable behavior during the period between the plea and sentencing, and the presentence report did not contain information that would compel County Court to find the agreement inappropriate. This case is thus distinguishable from People v Farrar (52 NY2d 302), cited by defendant, in which the sentencing court failed to exercise its own discretion at sentencing. Here, County Court clearly imposed sentence only after considering defendant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that information in the presentence report indicating that he had been in a substance abuse program because his parole officer believed that he had a drug problem was unreliable and requires reversal. This information was based upon defendant\u2019s own statements which he has not shown were inaccurate (see, People v Anderson, 184 AD2d 922, lv denied 80 NY2d 901). In addition, defense counsel was given the opportunity to review and comment on the report but failed to do so (see, supra; People v Tumerman, 133 AD2d 714, lv denied 70 NY2d 938, cert denied 485 US 969). Given defendant\u2019s present offense and his past conviction of a drug-related offense, County Court\u2019s conclusion that defendant had a substance abuse problem was reasonable despite defendant\u2019s denials.\nFinally, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court in view of defendant\u2019s criminal record and the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of his plea taken in satisfaction of a six-count indictment (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nWeiss, P.

Further, defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that tended to cast doubt upon his guilt and, as such, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable here (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 899 [2011]; People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d 1035, 1037 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]). In any event, his claim regarding his plea is without merit, as it is clear from the record that he was given an ample opportunity to discuss his decision to plead guilty with both his attorney and members of his family who were present in the courtroom at the time he entered his guilty plea (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d at 1035; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal precludes review of any claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d at 1035; People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d at 1037). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.\nMercure, J.E, Malone Jr., McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is based upon his claim that he was not advised, in advance of his plea, that he would be required to forfeit his vehicle as part of the plea agreement, and that he was rushed and pressured into taking the plea. [/INST] The court affirmed the defendant's guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance and the subsequent four-year prison sentence, along with two years of postrelease supervision and forfeiture of his vehicle. The defendant's appeal was denied primarily because he waived his right to appeal and failed to challenge the plea or sentence appropriately. Claims regarding the involuntariness of the plea were found to be unpreserved for review, as the defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or demonstrate any doubts about his guilt during the plea colloquy.</s>"}

Under Orange County indictment No. 04-536, the defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (a class A-I felony), and sentenced to an indeterminate term of 17\u00bd years to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed the judgment of conviction (see People v Garcia, 57 AD3d 918 [2008]). Under Orange County indictment No. 04-594, the defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (a class A-I felony), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (a class A-II felony), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (a class A-II felony), and two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (a class B felony). The defendant was sentenced to indeterminate terms of 17\u00bd years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, eight years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, eight years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, and 5 to 15 years imprisonment on each count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The sentence on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was to run concurrently with the sentences on the remaining counts in indictment No. 04-594, and consecutively to the sentence under indictment No. 04-536. This Court affirmed the judgment of conviction (see People v Garcia, 66 AD3d 699 [2009]).\nIn March 2010, the defendant moved for resentencing pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738), the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (L 2005, ch 643), and the Drug Law Reform Act of 2009 (CPL 440.46) (hereinafter collectively the DLRA). The County Court resentenced the defendant, pronouncing resentences for each count of both indictments, but without complying with the procedures specified in the DLRA, requiring the entry of initial orders specifying the proposed resentences. Consequently, this Court reversed the resentences and remitted the matter to the County Court for the entry of the initial DLRA orders specifying proposed resentences and informing the defendant that, unless he withdrew his motion or appealed from the initial DLRA orders, the County Court would enter orders vacating the sentences originally imposed and impose the proposed resentences (see People v Garcia, 107 AD3d 738 [2013]).\nBy order dated September 30, 2013, the County Court specified and informed the defendant that \u201cit is the Court\u2019s sentencing position that the defendant, upon resentence, should receive a determinate term of 17\u00bd years plus 5 years post release supervision on each indictment to run consecutively.\u201d While this pronouncement apparently refers to the class A-I felonies in each indictment, the court failed to specify its sentencing position with respect to the convictions of the class A-II felonies and the class B felonies under indictment No. 04-594.\nAccordingly, the order must be reversed, and we again remit the matter to the County Court, Orange County, for the entry of initial DLRA orders for each indictment, specifying the proposed resentences for each count of each indictment and informing the defendant that, unless he withdraws his motion or appeals from the initial DLRA orders, the County Court will enter orders vacating the sentences originally imposed and imposing the proposed resentences (see People v Struss, 79 AD3d 773 [2010]).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contention need not be reached in light of our determination.\nBalkin, J.P., Dickerson, LaSalle and Connolly, JJ., concur.

The court initially indicated a proposed determinate sentence of 17\u00bd years plus 5 years of post-release supervision for each indictment, but failed to address the sentencing for certain lesser felony convictions. The appellate court reversed the order and remitted the case for the County Court to specify proposed resentences for all counts in both indictments, ensuring compliance with the procedural requirements of the Drug Law Reform Act.</s>"}

County Court denied the motion and thereafter sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. The record of the plea proceeding reveals that County Court fully advised defendant of the rights that he was relinquishing by operation of his plea and ascertained that defendant understood those rights and was pleading guilty of his own volition (see People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]).

Defendant\u2019s claim that he was coerced into pleading guilty by representations made to him by counsel concerning the possible revocation of his bail are supported by nothing more than defendant\u2019s own statements and, accordingly, County Court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Alexander, 97 NY2d 482, 485 [2002]; People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 802 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004]; People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746, 747, 748 [2001]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Spain and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Mullen, J.), rendered November 16,1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nDefendant was charged in two separate indictments with the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third and fifth degrees and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth, fifth and seventh degrees. Initially, he entered a plea of not guilty. However, on August 22,1983, the day his trial was scheduled to begin, defendant withdrew the not guilty plea and, pursuant to a plea-bargaining agreement, pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nOn September 9,1983, defense counsel notified the trial court that defendant wished to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it was the product of duress. Defendant alleged that his guilty plea had been coerced by a threat which he had received in jail on the eve of trial, when a fellow inmate warned him that he would be seriously injured or killed if he took the stand and mentioned the name of a certain defendant in another drug case.\nFollowing a hearing on September 20, 1983, defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was denied. He was subsequently sentenced as a predicate felony offender, pursuant to the plea bargain, to a term of two to four years\u2019 imprisonment.\nOn this appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We disagree. At the guilty plea withdrawal hearing and in his subsequent appearances before the court, defendant raised his allegations of duress but failed to substantiate them with any supporting evidence. Accordingly, the trial court was faced only with the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility, which it resolved against him. It has been held that a defendant is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea based solely on subsequent unsupported allegations of innocence (People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55, 56-57; cf. People v Flowers, 30 NY2d 315, 317). This is especially true where, as here, the transcript of the plea hearing reveals that defendant\u2019s plea was voluntarily and knowingly made. In the instant matter, defendant was ably represented by an attorney with whom he stated that he had fully discussed the advisability of his guilty plea. Further, defendant admitted in his allocution the necessary elements of the crimes charged, and stated that he entered the plea voluntarily and understood the terms of the plea bargain. In turn, the trial court fully apprised defendant of the consequences of his plea (see People v Eagan, 90 AD2d 909; People v Brockway, 88 AD2d 1039, 1040). Given this exhaustive colloquy, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in subsequently denying defendant permission to withdraw his plea (see id.).\nWe are similarly unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in not holding a full blown evidentiary hearing on this issue. Only in rare instances will such a hearing be necessary (see People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926). However, in this case, the record discloses that defendant and defense counsel were afforded ample opportunity to present evidence of defendant\u2019s allegations before the court and that they failed to do so. Accordingly, there is no indication that the court abused its discretion in failing to hold a full evidentiary hearing (see People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940, 941).\nFinally, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contentions that the trial court erred in not permitting him to proceed pro se and in not considering his pro se motions. The record reveals, first, that defendant at no time requested permission to proceed pro se. Second, defendant\u2019s counsel informed the trial court that the arguments made in defendant\u2019s handwritten pro se motion papers (which the court found illegible) had been incorporated in defense counsel\u2019s own motion papers. Accordingly, there was no need for the trial court to render separate decisions on each of defendant\u2019s pro se motions.\nJudgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Casey and Weiss, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court of Cortland County, where he was convicted of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance after pleading guilty. He later sought to withdraw his plea, claiming it was coerced due to threats from an inmate, but the court denied this request, finding no supporting evidence for his claims and affirming the voluntary nature of his plea. The appellate court upheld the trial court's decision, noting that the defendant had adequate representation and was fully informed of the plea's consequences.</s>"}

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered March 28, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nAfter a search of his home revealed large quantities of cocaine and cash, defendant was charged in a felony complaint with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. He thereafter waived indictment and pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a superior court information. As a condition of the guilty plea, defendant waived his right to appeal, orally and in writing, and agreed to a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years. At the sentencing hearing, however, defendant moved to withdraw the plea on grounds that the agreed-upon sentence was inappropriate and that his guilty plea was coerced. Defense counsel opposed the withdrawal but supported the motion to the extent that it sought a reduction in defendant\u2019s sentence. County Court denied the motion and imposed the agreed-upon sentence, prompting this appeal by defendant.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was coerced into waiving his right to appeal. Our review of the record reveals that during the plea allocution defendant expressed his understanding of the waiver and denied that his consent to the terms of the plea agreement was procured by promise or force (see, People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 683-684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852; People v Brown, 239 AD2d 784, lv denied 91 NY2d 870).

Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant effectively waived his right to appeal, notwithstanding that he refused to reaffirm the waiver at sentencing (see, People v Marrero, 242 AD2d 800).

Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. He was allowed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, for which he could have received a sentence of up to 15 years in State prison. He was promised a one-year sentence in the County Jail. The court was aware that defendant had previously been adjudicated a youthful offender. After receiving the presentence investigation, the court stated that it could not adhere to the agreement because of appellant\u2019s record, attitude and crime. Defendant was given the opportunity to withdraw his plea and go to trial or to let the plea stand and receive a sentence of one to four years incarceration.

Supreme Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to 5V2 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The record discloses that Supreme Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea and defendant affirmed his understanding of the waiver. Defendant also signed a written waiver after conferring with counsel regarding its contents. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal his conviction and sentence was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Miller, 137 AD3d 1485, 1485 [2016]; People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1239-1240 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]).

We cannot say that defendant, who has a lengthy criminal record, was unaware that he could be exposed to a prison sentence if he rejected the plea offer and was found guilty following a trial on this indictment. In our view, defendant had ample opportunity to either raise this issue in an objection during these proceedings or in a motion to withdraw his plea and, therefore, he was required to preserve this claim (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 221-222 [2016]; People v Crowder, 24 NY3d 1134, 1136-1137 [2015]; People v White, 142 AD3d 1254, 1255 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1128 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Rose, Devine and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

People v Dallas, 31 AD3d 573 [2006]). To the extent that the contention can be reviewed, it is without merit (see People v Bicet, 180 AD2d 692, 693 [1992]; People v Torres, 96 AD2d 604 [1983]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that his pleas of guilty were coerced by the prosecution\u2019s promise of leniency for his wife is unpreserved for appellate review, since he did not move to withdraw his pleas on that basis, or otherwise raise this issue before the court of first instance (see People v Clarke, 93 NY2d 904, 906 [1999]; People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]; People v Coles, 240 AD2d 419 [1997]).

A second indictment (No. 88-110-B), returned on the same date, charged defendant with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance. Defendant pleaded guilty to single counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain in full satisfaction of both indictments, which included an agreed-upon sentence to two concurrent prison terms of 5 to 15 years as well as a waiver of defendant\u2019s right to appeal the conviction on indictment No. 88-110-B. At sentencing, defendant\u2019s new attorney requested leave to withdraw the guilty plea. County Court denied the request and this appeal ensued.\nDefendant has raised three arguments. Initially, we find merit in defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal regarding the second indictment. There is no indication that County Court specifically discussed the waiver of the right to appeal with defendant or that he understood the nature, terms and effect upon him. The record being devoid of this required colloquy, the waiver must be deemed invalid (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11).\nDefendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in denying his application to withdraw his plea is not persuasive. Clearly, permission to withdraw a guilty plea rests solely within the trial court\u2019s discretion (CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677; People v Gibson, 84 AD2d 885), and refusal to permit withdrawal does not constitute an abuse of that discretion unless there is some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in inducing the plea (People v Randolph, 78 AD2d 566). Defendant has not made these required claims. Instead he has challenged the adequacy of the plea allocution, contending that the plea was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent, and that he was denied effective representation of counsel. We disagree and reject each contention. There was an extensive and thorough allocution in which defendant unreservedly acknowledged that he understood the charges and the significance of his plea; he stated that it was voluntary and without coercion or inducement, that he was satisfied with retained counsel who had replaced his initial attorneys and that he understood he would receive a compromise of the charges against him; he was also told the possible sentences facing him (see, People v Kennedy, 141 AD2d 975, 977, lv denied 72 NY2d 1046). His admission of both possession and the sale of cocaine provided a sufficient predicate for accepting the plea (see, People v La Boy, 152 AD2d 866; People v Quick, 146 AD2d 815, lv denied 73 NY2d 1020). Defendant\u2019s factual recitation and responses to the questions from County Court established that he was fully aware of what was occurring and what he was doing (see, People v Bruno, 147 AD2d 490). There is nothing to indicate that the plea was improvident, involuntary or unknowingly made (see, People v Robideau, 133 AD2d 903, lv denied 71 NY2d 902).\nNor do we find merit in defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his agreement to plead guilty. While his initial attorneys may perhaps not have been as thorough as desired, they were succeeded by Alan Zwiebel, an attorney competent and experienced in criminal matters, who promptly initiated appropriate motion practice and investigation. Since the replacement attorney was fully aware of the alleged derelictions of his predecessors and nonetheless counseled acceptance of the plea bargain, defendant forfeited his claim or prior ineffective assistance of counsel as well as his appeal from the denial of permission to file a late suppression motion (see, People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529). We reject defendant\u2019s belated claim made upon this appeal that Zwiebel was ineffective. The record shows that within the brief time available to him before the trial date, he moved for discovery, an operability report, a Sandoval hearing and for disclosure of Rosario material. He negotiated a plea bargain in which charges against defendant were compromised and a lesser sentence imposed.\nWe similarly turn away defendant\u2019s contention that the search warrant was improperly issued upon a defective sup porting deposition and thus tainted the incriminating evidence obtained against him. The affidavit setting forth personal observations was made against the witnesses\u2019 penal interest and contained a warning against a false statement (see, Penal Law \u00a7210.45); it supported issuance of the search warrant without extrinsic evidence of the informant\u2019s reliability (see, People v Hicks, 38 NY2d 90; People v Santarelli, 148 AD2d 775). There is no basis to believe that a timely suppression motion would have been successful.\nIn sum, we find that defendant received meaningful representation from Zwiebel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137) and that his application to withdraw the plea was properly denied (see, People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677, supra).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Casey, Weiss, Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Greene County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance following a guilty plea. The defendant's appeal raised issues regarding the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal, the denial of his request to withdraw the plea, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the issuance of a search warrant. The Court found the waiver invalid due to a lack of proper discussion, but upheld the plea and representation as valid, denying the application to withdraw the plea and rejecting claims of ineffective counsel and issues with the search warrant.</s>"}

Defendant now contends that County Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and failed to exercise discretion in sentencing, and that his sentence is harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. There was no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A review of the record reveals that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to confer with his attorney, was satisfied with his representation and admitted his guilt of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see, People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, lv denied 75 NY2d 921). Any reluctance on defendant\u2019s part in entering his guilty plea is attributable not to \"threats or coercion but, rather, defendant\u2019s mere unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation\u201d (People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, lv denied 79 NY2d 949).

Defendant also offers no evidence to support his allegation that County Court failed to consider the presentence report prior to sentencing (see, People v Carmello, 114 AD2d 965). Finally, in light of defendant\u2019s advantageous plea bargain, by which defendant pleaded guilty to one count in satisfaction of a six-count indictment and received less than the harshest sentence possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nWeiss, P.

The defendant was to remain free from any further criminal activity and return to court on the scheduled sentencing date. The plea agreement gave the People the discretion to permit the defendant to withdraw the plea and plead guilty to a lesser charge and receive a lesser sentence than the minimum 3 to 6 year sentence for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. If the defendant did not return to court when he was supposed to or if he committed any other crimes while he was out pending sentence, the People could recommend a sentence of lxh to 15 years imprisonment. Sentencing was adjourned for approximately six weeks, and when the defendant failed to appear on that date, a bench warrant was issued. The defendant was arrested a couple of weeks later. At sentencing, it was learned that the defendant had also been recently arrested for drug possession and was issued a desk appearance ticket. Also at sentencing, an Assistant District Attorney, after having conversations with certain police personnel and the District Attorney\u2019s Homicide Bureau Chief, expressed his dissatisfaction with the defendant\u2019s cooperation in the ongoing investigation.\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on the issues of, inter alia, the Assistant District Attorney\u2019s motivation in refusing to make the requested recommendation of leniency. In view of the defendant\u2019s re-arrest prior to sentencing, his failure to return to the court on the scheduled date, and the contentions of the Assistant District Attorney regarding his lack of cooperation, the court had no reason to believe that the decision not to recommend a lesser term of imprisonment was improperly motivated (see, People v Anonymous, 219 AD2d 525; People v Jones, 184 AD2d 528).

Thereafter, defendant waived indictment and, pursuant to a superior court information, pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Defendant waived his right to appeal and, in June 2004, was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to a prison term of 5 to 15 years.\nInitially, we find unavailing defendant\u2019s claim that his waiver of his right to appeal did not preclude a challenge to the sentence imposed. \u201cWhere ... a defendant enters a guilty plea which the record reflects is knowing, voluntary and intelligent and includes a comprehensive waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal, the appeal waiver is enforceable and includes any challenge to the severity of the lawful sentence imposed\u201d (People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9-11 [1989]). Here, the record reflects that defendant was repeatedly informed that the waiver included his right to challenge the sentence imposed and he specifically acknowledged that he was relinquishing that right. Accordingly, we find no basis to conclude that defendant\u2019s waiver was anything less than all-encompassing (see People v Allen, supra at 763).\nIn any event, to the extent that defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to how he was sentenced survived his plea of guilty and the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Figueroa, 13 AD3d 163, 164 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 798 [2005]; People v Hidalgo, 283 AD2d 154 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 902 [2001]; People v Kinch, 237 AD2d 830, 831 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 860 [1997]), we are not persuaded that he is entitled to the requested relief. Specifically, defendant argues that the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738), signed into law after he was sentenced, violates his statutory and constitutional rights to equal protection by retroactively allowing individuals convicted of class A-I drug felonies prior to the Act\u2019s effective date to petition for resentencing pursuant to a new determinate sentencing scheme (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 23; see also Penal Law \u00a7 70.71), while not providing the same opportunity to persons convicted of class B felonies (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70). Defendant\u2019s challenge is lacking in merit inasmuch as there is a rational basis for distinguishing between class A-I and class B felony drug offenders for retroactivity purposes (see People v Walker, 81 NY2d 661, 668 [1993]; People v Parker, 41 NY2d 21, 25 [1976]). For example, it would be rational for the Legislature to allow retroactivity and extend the greatest relief to those facing the most stringent sentences while, at the same time, providing different retroactive relief to class B felony drug offenders by, among other things, granting eligibility to earn additional merit time reductions (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 30; Legislative Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2004, ch 738). Given the existence of these and other factors demonstrating a rational basis for the disparity in treatment with respect to resentencing, we find defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments unpersuasive.\nMercure, Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ, concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nGiven that defendant was already sentenced when the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act took effect and the legislation is not silent as to the issue of retroactivity, defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to relief pursuant to the \u201camelioration doctrine\u201d lacks merit (see People v Walker, 81 NY2d 661, 667 [1993]; People v Festo, 96 AD2d 765, 766 [1983], affd 60 NY2d 809 [1983]).

Defendant was thereafter indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to the charged crime and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison.\nInitially, defendant contends that County Court erred in accepting his plea of guilty because his recitation of the facts raised a possible agency defense. However, this argument is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Collier [Kelliehan], 283 AD2d 671, 671 [2001], lvs denied 96 NY2d 917, 920 [2001]; People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1006 [1999]). Although defendant maintains that the exception to the preservation rule applies herein because this is \u201cthe rare instance where \u2018the . . . recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon the defendant\u2019s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea\u2019 \u201d (People v Saitch, supra at 725, quoting People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]), we do not agree. Significantly, the exception applies only where the court \u201cfails to probe further to ensure that the defendant\u2019s plea is voluntary and the defendant understands the nature of the plea\u201d (People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819, 820 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]; see People v Lopez, supra at 666).\nHere, prior to accepting his plea, County Court carefully explained to defendant his constitutional rights and advised him of the rights he would be surrendering by pleading guilty. Defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and proceeded to clearly articulate that he gave Davis a quantity of crack cocaine in exchange for money that Davis had given to him on a prior occasion. In our view, County Court\u2019s inquiry sufficiently established the benefit that defendant received from participating in the sale \u201cand elicited sufficient facts supporting the conclusion that defendant acted with an \u2018independent desire or inclination to promote the transaction\u2019 \u201d (People v Mejias, supra at 820, quoting People v Argibay, 45 NY2d 45, 54 [1978]).\nDefendant further argues that the allocution did not establish that he was a \u201cseller\u201d of controlled substances as contemplated by the Penal Law. Notably, Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 (1) states that \u201c \u2018[s]ell\u2019 means to sell, exchange, give or dispose of to another, or to offer or agree to do the same.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the record establishes that he did sell drugs in accordance with that definition. Although no money actually changed hands at the time the drugs were provided to Davis, defendant admitted that he gave them to her in exchange for money that she had previously given to him. Therefore, defendant was properly deemed to have sold drugs under the meaning of the Penal Law.\nWe have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including his claim that the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738) should be applied retroactively so as to reduce his sentence (see People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 597 n [2005]), and find them to be without merit.\nMercure, Crew III, Carpinello and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Broome County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea.

Pursuant to a negotiated, signed plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge. In entering the plea agreement, defendant was advised that if she successfully completed both the inpatient and outpatient aspects of a specific drug treatment program, she could withdraw her plea, plead guilty to the misdemeanor of criminal possession of a controlled substance and be placed on three years of probation. She further agreed that if she failed to comply with the program or left prior to its completion, she would be in violation of the plea agreement and sentenced to a minimum term of 4x/2 to 9 years in prison.\nDefendant completed the inpatient portion of the program but failed to complete the outpatient portion. After her arrest, she appeared before County Court, was provided with counsel and advised that the drug court team determined that she was no longer eligible to participate in the program. The matter was scheduled for sentencing and a presentence investigation was ordered. At sentencing, defendant\u2019s conditional discharge was revoked and she was sentenced as a second felony offender to the minimum agreed upon term.\nUpon appeal, defendant contends that she was denied due process when County Court failed to hold a formal evidentiary hearing prior to sentencing. While we agree that the sentencing court is required to conduct an inquiry sufficient to conclude that a violation of the plea agreement has occurred (see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]), defendant failed to contest County Court\u2019s finding that she violated the plea agreement. For that reason, no formal hearing was required (see People v Hope, 32 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2006]; compare People v Jenkins, 29 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2006]).\nAs to defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea, it is unpreserved since no objection was raised during sentencing and no motion was made to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Vance, 27 AD3d 1015, 1016 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]; People v Alexander, 21 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 881 [2005]).

Viewing counsel\u2019s performance in totality as of the time of the representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]), we note counsel\u2019s success in negotiating a dismissal of the charge of resisting arrest and in obtaining the minimum sentence permitted by law. Defendant received meaningful representation since the plea is advantageous and no record evidence casts doubt upon the effectiveness of her counsel (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]).\nFinding no merit to the claim that the sentence was harsh or excessive, we affirm.\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 21h to 5 years on the assault charge and 41/2 to 9 years on the drug charge. It was also agreed that the weapons charge would be dismissed if defendant appeared on the scheduled sentencing date. Defendant, however, failed to appear at sentencing. County Court then imposed separate prison terms of 21h to 5 years on the assault and weapons charges, to be served consecutively, and 10 to 20 years on the drug charge, to be served concurrently with the other two sentences.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that his guilty plea was not properly entered. However, because defendant never moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, he cannot now challenge the sufficiency of his plea (see, People v Villafane, 216 AD2d 605, l;v denied 88 NY2d 996). In any event, the transcript of the plea allocution reveals that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea following a sufficient inquiry by County Court, during which time defendant admitted his guilt to the requisite elements of the crimes charged (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 975, lv denied 88 NY2d 994).\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the terms of imprisonment were harsh and excessive. Defendant has an extensive criminal record. In addition, he was specifically warned at the plea proceeding that if he failed to appear at sentencing, County Court would no longer be under any obligation to honor the agreed-upon prison sentences. In fact, the court told defendant that he faced the possibility of the harshest prison terms available and that each could be imposed consecutively. As it was, the prison terms imposed by the court were not the harshest possible and only two of the terms were made consecutive. Under these circumstances, we decline to disturb the sentences imposed by the court (see, People v Graham, 222 AD2d 918, lv denied 87 NY2d 973).\nCardona, P.

Defendant now appeals, contending that his plea was involuntary due to alleged misrepresentations made by County Court (Bruhn, J.) regarding his period of postrelease supervision.\nThe case law makes clear that \u201ca defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action\u201d (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; see People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010]). Thus, where the sentencing court fails to apprise a defendant \u2014 prior to the imposition of sentencing \u2014 of either the mandatory imposition of postrelease supervision or the \u201cspecific duration or range [there]of. . . , the voluntariness of the plea may be challenged on appeal even absent preservation of the issue by postallocution motion\u201d (People v Lee, 80 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2011], Iv denied 16 NY3d 832 [2011]; see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1231-1232 [2010], Iv granted 14 NY3d 888 [2010]).\nHere, however, defendant does not claim that the sentencing court failed to apprise him that he would be subject to a specified period of postrelease supervision. Rather, defendant contends that his plea bargain included the minimum period of postrelease supervision allowable by statute, which he asserts is IV2 years, and, therefore, the imposition of a longer term rendered his plea involuntary. Assuming, without deciding, that such a claim presents an exception to the preservation requirement, defendant\u2019s assertion that County Court misrepresented the term of postrelease supervision to be imposed lacks merit. The record reflects that defendant repeatedly was advised\u2014 both during the course of his plea and prior to the imposition of sentence \u2014 that he would be subject to three years of postrelease supervision.

As a condition of her release pending sentencing, County Court warned defendant that it was authorized to impose an enhanced sentence of 8V3 to 25 years in prison if she failed to appear for sentencing or was arrested on new charges before then. Defendant failed to appear on the scheduled sentencing date and eventually returned to court several months later, at which time she claimed that her nonappearance on the original sentencing date was not willful because she feared that any sentence imposed would be served at the County Jail where she had been sexually harassed by a correction officer during a previous period of incarceration. County Court adjourned the sentencing hearing in order to permit further investigation into this claim but, when the results of the investigation were disclosed on the new sentencing date two months later, the court found that defendant failed to substantiate her claim of sexual harassment. Defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of willfulness was denied, following which County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant appeals.\nContrary to defendant\u2019s contention, County Court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to imposing the enhanced sentence since the court gave defendant an opportunity to demonstrate the alleged mitigating circumstances surrounding her nonappearance and was ultimately satisfied that defendant\u2019s claim had no legitimate basis (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712-713; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880).

Memorandum: Upon his plea of guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to concurrent indeterminate terms of 4\u00bd to 9 years. He contends that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was improperly induced by County Court\u2019s threat of a heavier sentence if he were found guilty after trial. He further contends that there was an insufficient factual basis for the plea and that the court erred in accepting the plea without first determining whether defendant was aware of possible defenses. By failing to move to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to CPL 220.60 (3) or to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10, defendant failed to preserve those contentions for our review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666; People v Garrow [appeal No. 1], 233 AD2d 856, lv denied 89 NY2d 942; People v Rice [appeal No. 2], 224 AD2d 972, lv denied 88 NY2d 883; People v Coleman, 203 AD2d 729, 730).

At the time of his plea, defendant was not only represented by competent counsel who had the District Attorney explain how defendant was to cooperate, but defendant himself appeared to be fully aware of the level of participation required of him.

As part of this plea agreement, which defendant acknowledged was uncoerced, defendant was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing in exchange for cooperating with law enforcement officials in drug investigations. When defendant\u2019s cooperation proved valueless, the agreement was terminated and defendant was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.\nSubsequently, defendant again pleaded guilty, this time to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Some two weeks later, on the day of his sentencing, however, defendant, claiming that his plea was the product of threats directed at himself and his family by local drug bosses, moved to withdraw his plea. According to defendant, the threats were engendered by a letter that he had written a police investigator following the termination of his original plea agreement wherein defendant identified and agreed to cooperate in apprehending local drug dealers, which letter was allegedly circulated within the drug community.\nCounty Court, finding defendant\u2019s credibility wanting, denied the motion and sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant\u2019s subsequent CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the guilty plea was similarly denied.

As to the merits, it is well settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he question of whether [a] defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and a hearing will be granted only in rare instances\u2019 \u201d (People v Ross, 182 AD2d 1022, 1024, lv dismissed 80 NY2d 934, quoting People v De Gaspard, 170 AD2d 835, 837, lv denied 77 NY2d 994). Here, we find no error in County Court\u2019s denial, without a hearing, of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The record reveals that County Court afforded defendant a reasonable opportunity to advance the basis for his request and made relevant inquiries of defendant with respect thereto. Furthermore, a review of the plea allocution confirms that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and that he forthrightly acknowledged his guilt. Given these circumstances, County Court cannot be faulted for failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing (see generally, People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927; People v De Gaspard, supra, at 837; People v Kafka, 128 AD2d 895, lv denied 69 NY2d 951).

As part of the negotiated plea agreement, sentencing was adjourned for one year to give defendant an opportunity to complete a long-term residential substance abuse program. If defendant completed the program, she was to be sentenced to time served and five years of probation. It was also understood that if defendant failed to complete the program, she could be sentenced to 5% years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision.\nAfter defendant failed to complete the program, she was found to be in violation of her plea agreement and was sentenced to 51/2 years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision and ordered to pay restitution. On appeal to this Court, defendant\u2019s sentence was vacated and the matter was remitted to County Court on the grounds that the inclusion of restitution, which was not part of the negotiated plea agreement, enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence and defendant should have been afforded an opportunity to either withdraw her plea or accept the enhanced sentence (45 AD3d 1187, 1188 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 769 [2008]). In remitting the matter, we directed that defendant either be afforded the opportunity to withdraw her plea or accept the sentence that included the restitution, or, alternatively, County Court could resentence her pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement (id.). Upon remittal, defendant moved to withdraw her plea prior to resentencing. County Court denied the motion and thereafter sentenced her pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement.

Moreover, a review of the record reveals that defendant had expressed no dissatisfaction with her plea in the 16 months between the entering of her plea and her motion. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the motion was properly denied (see People v Darling, 183 AD2d 950, 952-953 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 902 [1992]).\nSpain, Rose, Kane and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the County Court's decision to deny the defendant's motion to withdraw her guilty plea for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance. After failing to complete a substance abuse program, the defendant was sentenced according to her negotiated plea agreement, which did not include restitution. The court found no merit in her claim to withdraw the plea, as she provided no evidence of innocence or inducement issues and had not expressed dissatisfaction with her plea in the intervening period.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Reilly, Jr., J.), rendered April 20, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nThe pertinent facts surrounding this matter can be found in a decision by this court wherein we dismissed the petition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced by defendant to prohibit the County Judge from refusing to accept his original guilty plea to a class B felony (see, Matter of Guzman v Harrigan, 158 AD2d 872). Defendant now argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to argue in that proceeding that the District Attorney should have been compelled to adhere to his original plea agreement which, defendant contends, included dismissal of three out of four indictments. As is evidenced by the record in this appeal and this court\u2019s decision dismissing the petition in the article 78 proceeding (supra), dismissal of the indictments was never offered to defendant by the District Attorney; rather, the first plea was to be in satisfaction of all four indictments. Therefore, even had defendant\u2019s trial counsel made the argument now advanced on this appeal, it would have been unavailing. In addition, as we also pointed out in Matter of Guzman v Harrigan (supra), County Court had no choice but to reject the first plea as it was in violation of CPL 220.30 (3) (b) (i) (see, supra, at 873; see also, People v Bartley, 47 NY2d 965, 966). We have also considered defendant\u2019s remaining argument with respect to the excessiveness of his concurrent prison sentences, the harshest of which is 15 years to life, and reject it as lacking in merit (see, People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169, 174; People v Honsinger, 162 AD2d 877, 878, lv denied 76 NY2d 894).\nWeiss, P.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Rohl, J.), rendered October 28, 1986, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nThe defendant was indicted for criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, class A-I felonies. The charges arose out of a sale of nearly nine ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer on July 23, 1986. The defendant was permitted to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class AII felony. He was promised a term of incarceration of five years to life. The promised sentence was imposed.\nThe defendant raised two constitutional challenges to the sentence statute which mandates a maximum sentence of life incarceration for persons convicted of class A felony drug offenses. We find that the challenges to the statute are merit-less. The mandatory maximum of life imprisonment for this crime does \"not rise to the gross disproportionality violative of constitutional limitations\u201d (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 111, cert denied 423 US 950; People v Donovan, 59 NY2d 834). Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that the sentencing statute violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment must fail.\nSimilarly, the defendant\u2019s claim that the mandatory maximum sentence constitutes an illegal deprivation of judicial discretion is contrary to established authority. It is well settled that, within the constraints of due process, the Legislature has broad power to prescribe minimum and maximum sentences (see, People v Felix, 58 NY2d 156, 164, appeal dismissed 464 US 802). The statute at issue in this case mandates a maximum sentence of life while permitting a minimum sentence of 3 to 8 Vs years (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [a], [3] [a] [ii]). These limitations on judicial discretion in sentencing do not violate due process (see, People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93, 96; People v Butler, 46 AD2d 422, 426-427).\nFurthermore, the statute does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as applied to the defendant; although the defendant had no prior criminal record, the amount of cocaine sold in this case was substantial. Moreover, the defendant was actively involved in the transaction and was motivated by greed. The defendant has not shown that his sentence was disproportionate to the sentences imposed upon other similarly situated defendants. Under the circumstances, the sentence was not disproportionate to the crime (see, Castillo v Harris, 491 F Supp 33 [SD NY 1980], affd 646 F2d 559; People v Murphy, 53 AD2d 937).\nFinally, the facts of this case do not warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice. The defendant, who pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive the sentence which was actually imposed, has no basis to now complain that his sentence was excessive (see, People v Ramos, 109 AD2d 898, 899; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816, 817). Thompson, J. P., Bracken, Brown, Weinstein and Spatt, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant's appeal against a judgment convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was affirmed by the County Court. He had pleaded guilty to this charge, which stemmed from a sale of cocaine to an undercover officer, and received a sentence of five years to life\u2014a sentence he was aware of upon pleading. The court rejected his constitutional challenges to the sentencing statute, ruling that the mandatory maximum sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment or due process, and found that the circumstances of the case did not warrant a reduction of the sentence.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nPeters, P.J.\nAppeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered December 19, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered January 6, 2015 in Sullivan County, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.\nDefendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts). Following the denial of his motion to suppress statements made to police and physical evidence seized upon his arrest, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the charges and purportedly waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to eight years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant\u2019s subsequent CPL article 440 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the order denying his motion to vacate.\nInitially, we find that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal was not valid. During the plea colloquy, County Court failed to adequately convey \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Blackmon, 122 AD3d 1071, 1072 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]). Although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, there was no attempt by the court to \u201censure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver\u201d (People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; accord People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d at 1423; People v Ritter, 124 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2015]).\nBecause the appeal waiver is invalid, defendant is not precluded from challenging County Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. Nevertheless, we find no merit in his claim that the statements he made to police and the physical evidence seized upon his arrest should have been suppressed because the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest him. \u201cEven if an arresting officer lacks personal knowledge sufficient to establish probable cause, the arrest will be lawful if the officer acts upon the direction of or as a result of communication with a superior or fellow officer or another police department provided that the police as a whole were in possession of information sufficient to constitute probable cause to make the arrest\u201d (People v Taylor, 134 AD3d 1165, 1169 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted], lv denied 26 NY3d 1150 [2016]; accord People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d 99, 113 [1996]; see People v Carter, 140 AD3d 1394, 1395 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 969 [2016]). Here, probable cause was established by defendant\u2019s sale of heroin to an undercover officer on the day before his arrest (see People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1269-1270 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]; People v Perez, 47 AD3d 1071, 1072-1073 [2008]). The arresting officer testified that, although he had no personal knowledge of defendant\u2019s activities at the time of the drug transaction, he was present at the scene. \u201cWhile it would have been better practice to elicit direct evidence of a communication between the officers, the suppression court was not precluded from drawing the inference from the circumstantial evidence presented\u201d that the information regarding the drug transaction had been conveyed to the arresting officer (People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d at 114; see People v Darby, 287 AD2d 300, 300 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 753 [2002]). Accordingly, the arrest of defendant was lawful, and County Court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress (see People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d at 114; People v Taylor, 134 AD3d at 1169-1170; People v Garcia, 131 AD3d 732, 734 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 997 [2016]).\nWe do, however, agree with defendant that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because County Court failed to advise him of the rights that he was waiving by pleading guilty (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; People v Proper, 133 AD3d 918, 919 [2015]). Although defendant\u2019s challenge to the plea was not preserved through an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]), we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to reverse the judgment (see People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d 1115, 1116-1117 [2015]). \u201cWhile there is no mandatory catechism required of a pleading defendant, there must be an affirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his or her constitutional rights\u201d (People v Lowe, 133 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]; see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365-366; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1116-1117).\nHere, County Court made no effort to explain the consequences of a guilty plea, making only a passing reference to them by asking defendant if anyone was forcing him to give up his \u201cright[ ] to [a] jury trial\u201d (see People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245-1246; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117; compare People v Proper, 133 AD3d at 919). The court further failed to establish that defendant had consulted with his counsel about the trial-related rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty or the constitutional consequences of a guilty plea, \u201cinstead making a vague inquiry into whether defendant had spoken to defense counsel\u201d (People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117) or had any questions of his counsel regarding his \u201crights,\u201d \u201cthe plea bargain, the trial and anything else that [was] important to [him]\u201d (see People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117). With no affirmative showing on the record that defendant understood and waived his constitutional rights when he entered the guilty plea, the plea was invalid and must be vacated (see People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117; People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015]).\nFinally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in denying his CPL article 440 motion without a hearing. Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his right to testify before the grand jury can be determined on the record and was reviewable on direct appeal, County Court properly denied the motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [2] [b]; People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]; People v Chiacchiarini, 91 AD3d 1118, 1119 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 863 [2012]; People v Lagas, 49 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 866 [2008]).\nEgan Jr., Rose, Devine and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is reversed, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, and matter remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.\nOrdered that the order is affirmed. [/INST] The court reversed the judgment of conviction against the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance, ruling that the plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent due to inadequate advisement of the rights being waived.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nWeiss, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered April 5, 1984, which revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.\nOn January 10, 1979, defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation on a conviction for burglary in the third degree. On December 17, 1983, approximately three weeks prior to the expiration of the probation term, defendant was placed under arrest on the basis of marihuana possession and two incidents in November 1983 in which he allegedly sold a controlled substance (codeine pills) to an undercover police informant. In February 1984, defendant entered a plea of guilty in Kingston City Court to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree in full satisfaction of the pending charges and received a 90-day suspended sentence. In the meantime, a petition for violation of probation was filed premised on the above incidents. On March 5, 1984, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the probation violation and, one month later, was sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment of nine months, in accord with the negotiated plea agreement.\nOn this appeal, defendant maintains that the sentence was unduly harsh and that he failed to receive the effective assistance of counsel. This latter contention is premised on the assertion that defendant\u2019s attorney in the Kingston City Court matter failed to apprise him of the consequences of his guilty plea on the pending probation sentence. Beyond the fact that this argument is grounded on matters dehors the record, it simply represents a collateral challenge to a separate conviction, not the matter before us. With respect to the sentence, the record indicates that defendant served eight months\u2019 imprisonment prior to being released on his own recognizance pending this appeal. In the meantime, defendant represents that he has married, fathered a child and obtained full-time employment. In effect, defendant requests this court to modify the sentence to time served, i.e., eight months.\nThere is little question that defendant received the benefit of his plea bargain when a nine-month sentence was imposed. Defendant has several previous criminal convictions, and his performance while on probation was less than remarkable. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the sentencing court (see, People v Howland, 108 AD2d 1019, 1020). At this juncture, however, we perceive little purpose in directing the completion of this sentence. Accordingly, we choose to exercise our discretion by modifying the sentence to a period commensurate with the time served (see, CPL 470.15; People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 335, affd 67 NY2d 625; People v Whiting, 89 AD2d 694).\nJudgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the \u00cdnteres): of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed to time served, and, as so modified, affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Main, Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court reviewed a case where the defendant's probation for a burglary conviction was revoked due to new drug-related offenses, leading to a nine-month prison sentence. The defendant argued that the sentence was harsh and that he did not receive effective legal counsel regarding the plea's impact on his probation. The court found no abuse of discretion in the original sentencing but, recognizing the defendant's positive changes since incarceration, modified the sentence to time served, affirming the judgment as modified.</s>"}

Defendant was administered Parker warnings and released from custody. When he failed to appear for sentencing, an arrest warrant was issued.\nIn the fall of 2007, defendant was involved in further criminal activity resulting in an April 2008 indictment for numerous drug-related offenses. As a result of further negotiations, on March 4, 2009, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and agreed to be sentenced as a second felony drug offender to an aggregate prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of five years. County Court sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon sentences on both convictions and ran the sentences concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved from his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that no nonfrivolous issues exist that could be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record, however, we are required to vacate the unauthorized sentence imposed on defendant\u2019s plea to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Defendant pleaded guilty to a class A-I felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [1]; \u00a7 220.21) and, as a second felony drug offender, was subject to a minimum term of imprisonment of 12 years (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.71 [3] [b] [i]; People v Cameron, 83 NY2d 838, 840 [1994]). While this issue was not raised by either party before the sentencing court or on appeal and the sentence as imposed favors defendant, we nevertheless must vacate the illegal sentence (see People v Warner, 69 AD3d 1052, 1054 [2010]; People v Davis, 37 AD3d 1179, 1180 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 983 [2007]).

During the trial on these charges, defense counsel informed County Court that he had just been provided with certain letters written by defendant to an individual who was present when defendant was arrested and that one of the letters contained \u201cvery, very damning statements and admissions by [defendant].\u201d Defense counsel further informed County Court that, on account of this new evidence, he had advised defendant that he should accept the plea agreement offer that had been presented to him prior to trial.

County Court subsequently sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of eight years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal, that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, survives his waiver of the right to appeal, but is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to make an appropriate postal-locution motion (see People v Laflower, 145 AD3d 1341, 1342 [2016]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]). Although defendant sent County Court a letter seeking a mistrial and to vacate his plea, County Court rejected it three weeks prior to sentencing, informing him that the letter did not constitute a proper motion to withdraw his plea, as it contained no sworn allegations of fact, no citation to case law supporting his request and that it was not served on the People or defense counsel. At sentencing, County Court reiterated that defendant\u2019s letter did not constitute a motion to withdraw his plea. When given an opportunity to address County Court prior to sentencing, defendant did not make any further request to withdraw his plea and did not offer an affidavit or any other evidence in support of the issues raised in his letter. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not preserved for our review. Moreover, defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution so as to trigger the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]).\nGarry, J.P., Lynch, Rose and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nEven if defendant\u2019s letter could be construed as a formal motion (cf.

In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a prior felony offender to eight years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Our review of the record reveals that defendant had a prior nonviolent felony conviction and County Court incorrectly informed him that he faced potential sentences of up to 15 years (compare Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i] [up to 12 years where prior felony was nonviolent] with Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4] [b] [i] [up to 15 years where prior felony was violent]).

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nDevine, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered June 21, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn full satisfaction of a 10-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. In exchange for his plea, defendant was promised a prison sentence of seven years conditioned upon, among other things, not committing any new offenses prior to sentencing. Shortly before sentencing, defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marihuana and possession of contraband in prison in the second degree. Defendant then admitted at sentencing that he had violated one of the conditions imposed by County Court at the time of his plea. County Court accordingly sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to a prison term of eight years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and ordered him to pay $500 in restitution. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant argues that his plea was invalid because County Court failed to sufficiently advise him that he would be giving up certain rights by pleading guilty (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; see also Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015]). While this challenge survives defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver (see People v Klinger, 129 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2015]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1449 [2014]), it was not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion in the ample period between plea and sentencing (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1537 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]). In any event, the plea colloquy leaves no doubt that defendant was aware of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent decision to proceed (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d at 1538).\nDefendant further contends that County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence because he was not advised of the possible maximum term of imprisonment that he could receive if he violated the terms and conditions of his plea. This contention is also unpreserved for our review due to defend ant\u2019s failure to either object to the enhanced sentence or make an appropriate postallocution motion, and the record gives us no reason to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 984 [2014]; People v Overton, 105 AD3d 1072, 1072-1073 [2013]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Lynch, Mulvey and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The Appellate Court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty. Despite the defendant's arguments that his plea was invalid and that he was not properly informed of the potential sentence upon violating plea conditions, the court found these challenges unpreserved for review due to the defendant's failure to raise them adequately before sentencing. Consequently, the court upheld the sentence of eight years in prison, followed by two years of post-release supervision, along with a restitution order.</s>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCardona, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered January 9, 1992, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts).\nDefendant was convicted of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant initially contends that County Court committed error when it required disclosure of a single page of notes made by defendant\u2019s counsel during the course of a pretrial interview of a defense witness prior to direct testimony. We disagree. Under CPL 240.45 (2) (a), a defendant has an obligation to turn over to the People \"any written or recorded statement made by a person other than the defendant whom the defendant intends to call as a witness at the trial, and which relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019s testimony\u201d. This disclosure is required to be made \"[ajfter presentation of the people\u2019s direct case and before the presentation of the defendant\u2019s direct case\u201d (CPL 240.45 [2]). Because defense counsel took no pretrial statement from the witness, the notes were properly considered as a substitute (see, People v Huhn, 140 AD2d 760, 762, lv denied 72 NY2d 919). We note that County Court redacted the notes to delete the proposed questions which defense counsel intended to ask and thus only required disclosure of those portions that were deemed declarative. We discern no prejudice to defendant in the court\u2019s use of this procedure (see, supra, at 762).\nDefendant next contends that County Court erred in allowing the jury to use tape transcripts during its deliberations. Here, the audibility of the tape recordings and the accuracy of the corresponding transcripts had been established before the court allowed their admission at trial. The court gave specific instructions to the jury during the trial and during its deliberations that the transcripts were only being received as aids and were not themselves to be considered evidence. Furthermore, during deliberations when the jury requested to be supplied with the tape transcripts, County Court complied with the request and at the same time specifically instructed that the tapes themselves would be made available to the jury. In fact, the jury subsequently acted upon this instruction by requesting to listen to one of the tapes. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by permitting the jury to use the tape transcripts as an aid during its deliberations (see, People v Kuss, 81 AD2d 427, 429-430).\nFinally, defendant contends that his sentence of three concurrent terms of imprisonment of 8 Vs to 25 years was unduly harsh and excessive. \" '[T]he imposition of the sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we should not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d (People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838, quoting People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663). Defendant\u2019s sentence was within the statutory parameters (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). The record shows that County Court properly exercised its discretion in considering the individual circumstances of defendant, a first-time offender, and the serious nature of the crimes committed (see, People v Pedraza, 66 NY2d 626, 627). We note that defendant was found guilty of three distinct criminal acts for which he could have been sentenced to consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment. We do not find this to be an appropriate case in which to exercise this Court\u2019s discretion to modify the sentence in the interest of justice.\nCrew III, J.

[/INST] The appeal from the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance was affirmed.

The defendant's sentence of concurrent terms of 8 \u00bd to 25 years was deemed appropriate given the circumstances, as it fell within statutory parameters and took into account the nature of the offenses.</s>"}

Although the plea agreement provided for restitution, no amount appears in the record of the plea colloquy. Defendant stated at sentencing that the amount in the presentence report, which has not been furnished on appeal, exceeded the amount discussed at the time of the plea.\nWhere, as here, there was no proof before County Court concerning the loss sustained, the court should have held a hearing to determine the proper amount of restitution (see, Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [2]; People v Millar, 144 AD2d 1032). Although defendant by his plea consented to the restitution provision and he failed to request a hearing at the time of sentencing, defendant is nevertheless entitled to a restitution hearing because of the \u201c \u2018essential nature\u2019 of the right to be sentenced as provided by law\u201d (People v Fuller, 57 NY2d 152, 156; see, People v Bentivegna, 145 AD2d 899, 899-900).\nWe modify the judgment, therefore, by vacating the amount of restitution, and we remit the matter to Jefferson County Court for a hearing to determine the amount of restitution.

Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and, in accordance with defendant\u2019s plea agreement, two concurrent prison terms of six years to life were to be imposed. At sentenc ing, however, County Court instead imposed two concurrent prison terms of six years. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, inasmuch as he has failed to move either to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has not preserved his claim that his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Lopez, 52 AD3d 852, 853 [2008]; People v Jennings, 46 AD3d 1029, 1029 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 766 [2008]). Were we to consider his claim, we would conclude that his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Clapper, 51 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2008]). The plea allocution clearly indicates that defendant was advised by County Court that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, that the People had the obligation to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury\u2019s verdict had to be unanimous. Defendant indicated that he understood those rights and acknowledged that he had not been forced, threatened or coerced into giving up these rights. Defendant stated that he was satisfied with counsel and proceeded to allocute the facts that constituted the crime to which he pleaded guilty.\nNor was there was any confusion surrounding the sentence that would be imposed if, in fact, defendant pleaded guilty. While defendant requested that he be sentenced to concurrent six-year prison terms in accordance with the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (hereinafter DLRA), he was aware at the time that he entered his plea that the plea agreement called for the imposition of two concurrent sentences of six years to life (see People v La Porte, 31 AD3d 800, 801 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]; People v Gorham, 18 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2005]).\nHowever, defendant\u2019s sentence as imposed by County Court must be modified. Rather than imposing the agreed-upon sentence of six years to life, County Court found that defendant qualified to be sentenced under the DLRA and, based upon that finding, imposed two six-year prison terms. Inasmuch as the crimes for which defendant pleaded guilty were committed prior to the effective date of the DLRA\u2014and the DLRA sentencing guidelines cannot be imposed retrospectively (see People v Utsey, 7 NY3d 398, 403 [2006]; People v Warren, 41 AD3d 745, 746 [2007])\u2014County Court was required to sentence defendant as a second felony offender convicted of a class A-II felony to an indeterminate period of imprisonment with a maximum term of life imprisonment (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [a]) and a minimum term of no less than six years (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [4] [a]). Consequently, the sentences as imposed by County Court were illegal and \u201cby operation of law they cannot stand\u201d (People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941, 941 [1995]; see People v Tubbs, 157 AD2d 915, 916 [1990], lv denied 76 NY2d 744 [1990]). Defendant\u2019s sentence is therefore vacated and the matter is remitted for County Court to impose the agreed-upon indeterminate prison term. Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.\nMercure, J.P., Spain, Rose and Stein, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered April 11, 2016, which resen-tenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).\nThe underlying facts are more fully set forth in our prior decision in this matter (134 AD3d 1353 [2015]). Briefly, defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in this third degree (two counts) with the understanding that he would enter a judicial diversion program and faced up to 24 years in prison if he did not complete it. Defendant was charged with violating the terms and conditions of the program, and then admitted that he had done so. Defendant did so with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision.\nUpon appeal, defendant argued that his prior felony conviction in New Hampshire was not the equivalent of a felony in New York and that he should not have been adjudicated as a second felony offender. This Court found that defendant\u2019s argument on this point was unpreserved and affirmed the judgment of conviction (id. at 1354). Defendant then successfully moved to set aside his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20. County Court resentenced him, as a felony drug offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to be served under parole supervision pursuant to CPL 410.91 (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [d]). Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s claim that the resentence imposed is harsh and excessive is predicated in large measure upon the fact that the original sentence of seven years in prison was one year more than the minimum term allowed for a second felony drug offender in his position (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.70 [4] [b] [i]; 220.39 [1]). He reasons that he should have been resentenced to an aggregate prison term of two years, the minimum allowable term plus one year, and that any period of incarceration in excess of two years is harsh and excessive (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [a] [i]).\nWe disagree. After considering the pertinent factors, including defendant\u2019s positive program accomplishments while confined and his criminal history, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in resentencing defendant in the middle of the permissible sentencing range or that defendant has presented any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Smith, 135 AD3d 1248, 1248-1249 [2016]; People v Cruz, 131 AD3d 724, 728 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1087 [2015]).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Judgment unanimously reversed, motion to withdraw plea granted, and matter remitted to Orleans County Court for further proceedings on the indictment. Memorandum: Defendant was charged with one count of criminally selling a controlled substance, second degree, and one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance, third degree. After jury selection had started, defendant agreed to plead guilty to two counts of selling in the third degree. At the request of the District Attorney the plea hearing was conducted in the presence of the jury panel and produced defendant\u2019s version that, at the urging of two acquaintances (at the sentencing these were identified as undercover police agents) he went from Albion to Rochester and obtained heroin for them. Defendant stated that he pleaded guilty after conferring with counsel and that he was satisfied with his legal representation. He did, however, state that his plea was not voluntary but done upon the advice of counsel. There is no reference in the record to what was said, if anything, as to the possible sentence that he might receive. When the court asked defendant if any promises had been made to him, defendant responded, \"Well, they say if I cooperate with the authorities \u2014 \u201d. Before defendant finished his sentence, the court stated, \"You promise to cooperate with the authorities, is that correct?\u201d The court opened the sentencing hearing by instructing defendant on the law of agency (see People v Lindsey, 16 AD2d 805, affd 12 NY2d 958; People v Branch, 13 AD2d 714) because it \"should have mentioned\u201d it at the time of pleading. In view of the subsequent denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the court\u2019s purpose in giving this instruction is not entirely clear. Defendant then moved to withdraw his plea, stating that he was innocent, that he acted only as an agent of the buyers, that he had been \"rushed\u201d to plead and that he had pleaded guilty not voluntarily or understanding^ but upon the \"advice\u201d of counsel (see People v Bowers, 45 AD2d 241, 243-244; and cf. People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55) and without understanding the possible sentence. He stated that at the time of pleading his wife was in the hospital undergoing serious kidney surgery. His counsel stated that he had explained the penalty that could be imposed by the court but \"I don\u2019t know that it was explained clear enough.\u201d The lawyer then urged the court to put defendant on probation. Defendant was a migrant worker who had come to the Albion area about 12 years earlier. He was married with a child, steadily employed by Lipton Company, owned his own home and had no prior arrests or convictions. The permissible mandatory minimum sentence on each count was one to eight and one-third years. The court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment having a mandatory minimum of eight and one-third years and a maximum of life, precisely the maximum sentence that defendant could have received if found guilty as charged after trial and without his promise to co-operate with the authorities. While no set formula is mandated in taking a plea of guilty, the court must take care before doing so to determine that defendant has in fact committed a crime and that he appreciates the consequences of his plea and the possible penal sanctions which may be imposed upon him as a result (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 345; People v Woods, 50 AD2d 720). This is particularly so in cases such as this where the court contemplates the maximum sentence possible after trial and when the sentence is severe. The \"bargain\u201d then becomes little more than an occasion whereby defendant throws himself on the mercy of the court and he should do so only with a full appreciation of the court\u2019s intentions.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nRose, J.P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered February 28, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and conspiracy in the second degree.\nAfter a mobile methamphetamine laboratory was discovered in the bathroom of defendant\u2019s motel room, he was arrested and charged by indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (count 1), unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree (count 2) and conspiracy in the second degree (count 3). Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that count 3 was jurisdictionally defective was denied and, thereafter, the People moved to amend that count of the indictment (see CPL 200.70). County Court granted the People\u2019s motion, finding that the requested amendment did not change the People\u2019s theory as presented to the grand jury. Subsequently, defendant entered a plea of guilty to all counts of the indictment and was later sentenced, as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction, to an aggregate prison term of 15 to 20 years to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision. He was also ordered to pay restitution. Defendant now appeals.\nWe find merit to defendant\u2019s argument that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective, a claim which is not foreclosed by his guilty plea (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]; People v Motley, 69 NY2d 870, 871-872 [1987]; People v Griswold, 95 AD3d 1454, 1454 [2012], lv denied 97 NY3d 997 [2012]). It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[a] valid and sufficient accusatory instrument is a nonwaivable jurisdictional prerequisite to a criminal prosecution\u2019 \u201d (People v Dreyden, 15 NY3d 100, 103 [2010], quoting People v Case, 42 NY2d 98, 99 [1977] [citation omitted]; accord People v Jackson, 18 NY3d 738, 741 [2012]). An indictment is jurisdictionally defective \u201c \u2018if it does not charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime, by, for example, failing to allege every material element of the crime charged, or alleging acts that do not equal a crime at all\u2019 \u201d (People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013], quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d at 231; see People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978]; People v Polanco, 2 AD3d 1154, 1154 [2003]).\nHere, count 3 of the indictment charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree, a crime which requires an \u201cintent that conduct constituting a class A felony be performed\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 105.15). While count 3 references the relevant statutory section for conspiracy in the second degree and expressly states that defendant acted \u201cwith intent that conduct constituting a class A felony be performed,\u201d it does not include any statutory reference to the class A felony listed in count 1 of the indictment. Rather, the factual allegations\u2014that \u201cdefendant did agree with [another] to unlawfully manufacture, prepare or produce methamphetamine\u201d\u2014are taken from count 2 of the indictment, which charged the class D felony of unlawful manufacturing of methamphetamine in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.73). The unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, even in the first degree, does not constitute a class A felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.75), and third-degree unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, as charged in count 2 of the indictment, could only be grounds for a charge of conspiracy in the fifth degree, a class A misdemeanor (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 105.05, 220.73).\nWhile it is true that \u201c[t]he incorporation [in an indictment] by specific reference to the statute [defining the crime charged] operates without more to constitute allegations of all the elements of the crime required by explicit provision of the statute itself or by judicial gloss overlaid thereon\u201d (People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586 [1981]; see People v D\u2019Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 735 [2002]; People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850 [1988]), such reference may be negated, as it was here, by the inclusion of conduct that does not constitute the crime charged (see People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d 1126, 1128 n 3 [2009]; compare People v Motley, 69 NY2d at 872). Accordingly, count 3 of the indictment was jurisdictionally defective because it failed to effectively charge defendant with the commission of a crime. Count 3 must be dismissed, therefore, and defendant\u2019s sentence on that count must be vacated (see People v Hines, 84 AD3d 1591, 1591-1592 [2011]; People v Reeves, 78 AD3d 1332, 1333 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 835 [2011]; People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d at 1127-1128).\nWhile not essential to our holding, it bears noting that the People\u2019s efforts to cure the jurisdictional defect in count 3 of the indictment were not authorized by the terms of GPL 200.70. Pursuant to GPL 200.70 (1), a trial court may permit an indictment to be amended \u201cwith respect to defects, errors or variances from the proof relating to matters of form, time, place, names of persons and the like,\u201d so long as the amendment does not change the theory of the prosecution as presented to the grand jury or otherwise tend to prejudice a defendant on the merits. Significantly, however, GPL 200.70 (2) prohibits any amendment of the indictment when, among other things, the amendment is needed in order to cure a failure to charge or state an offense (see GPL 200.70 [2] [a]). In short, \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that the [g]rand [j]ury minutes support a charge, the indictment cannot be amended to cure one of the defects specified in [GPL 200.70 (2)]\u201d (Peter Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, GPL 200.70 at 18; see e.g. People v Struts, 281 AD2d 655, 656 [2001]). Here, the amendment effectively cured the failure to charge the crime of conspiracy in the second degree and, therefore, was prohibited by GPL 200.70 (2), regardless of any consistency with the People\u2019s theory before the grand jury (see People v Perez, 83 NY2d 269, 276 [1994]).\nDefendant also contends, and the People concede, that the sentence imposed on count 2 of the indictment is illegal. The maximum permissible term of postrelease supervision for unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree is two years (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.70 [4] [b]; 70.45 [2] [c]; 220.73 [1]). Thus, County Court\u2019s imposition of a three-year term of post-release supervision is not an authorized sentence pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.45, and the judgment must be modified accordingly and the matter remitted for resentencing on that count (see People v Mao-Sheng Lin, 84 AD3d 1595, 1595 [2011]; People v Guay, 72 AD3d 1201, 1205 [2010], affd 18 NY3d 16 [2011]). We are not persuaded, however, that defendant was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender. Although he now contends that the sentences imposed on his predicate felony convictions were illegal, \u201ca sentencing defect does not invalidate a prior conviction for purposes of adjudicating defendant\u2019s subsequent felony offender status\u201d (People v Ashley, 71 AD3d 1286, 1287 [2010], affd 16 NY3d 725 [2011]; see People ex rel. Emanuel v McMann, 7 NY2d 342, 344-345 [I960]; People v Mingo, 85 AD3d 1061, 1061 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 954 [2011]).\nOur review of defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive is limited to the terms of the sentence that are not affected by our conclusion that count 3 of the indictment must be dismissed and the term of postrelease supervision imposed on count 2 must be vacated. In light of defendant\u2019s significant criminal history and the dangerous nature of his activities, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting reduction of the sentence (see People v Kendall, 91 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2012]; People v Sawinski, 294 AD2d 667, 669 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 701 [2002]). We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be unavailing.\nSpain, McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reversing defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy in the second degree under count 3 of the indictment and vacating defendant\u2019s sentence for unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree under count 2 of the indictment; count 3 dismissed and the sentence imposed thereon vacated, and matter remitted to the County Court of Clinton County for resentencing on count 2; and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy in the second degree due to a jurisdictional defect in the indictment, which failed to adequately charge the crime. The court also vacated the illegal three-year post-release supervision sentence imposed for the unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree, mandating resentencing on that count. The defendant's remaining arguments were found unpersuasive, and the judgment was modified accordingly.</s>"}

A waiver of the right to appeal was recited as a term of the plea, although there is no written waiver. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to 6V2 years to life in prison. Previously, this Court rejected an Anders brief (29 AD3d 1076 [2006]) and new counsel was assigned, and we now affirm.\nInitially, upon our review of the record, we find that defendant\u2019s oral waiver of appeal is not enforceable as the plea minutes do not adequately establish that defendant understood that \u201cthe right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2007]; People v Trotter, 28 AD3d 947, 948-949 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]; People v Barton, 28 AD3d 943, 944 [2006]). Also, the record does not reflect that defense counsel explained the appeal waiver to defendant or that defendant expressly waived that right (see People v Edwards, 37 AD3d 871 [2007]; People v Crowley, 34 AD3d 866, 866-867 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 924 [2006]; People v Phillips, 28 AD3d 939, 939 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 761 [2006]; cf. People v Nason, 31 AD3d 818, 819 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 869 [2006]).\nDefendant\u2019s contention that her guilty plea was not voluntar ily, knowingly and intelligently entered has not been preserved for our review, given that she never moved to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d 643, 643 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Bennett, 24 AD3d 975, 975 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 831 [2006]), and her challenge to the effectiveness of her counsel is similarly not preserved (see People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]). In any event, were we to consider these issues, we would find that the plea minutes reflect that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Defendant was advised of her rights and stated on the record that she understood the consequences of the plea, she had ample time to consult with her attorney, and she was satisfied with her attorney\u2019s representation (see People v Robetoy, 21 AD3d 1220, 1220 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 758 [2005] ; People v Threatt, 16 AD3d 706, 707 [2005]; People v Hill, 11 AD3d 817, 818 [2004]). Moreover, in negotiating a favorable plea agreement and throughout the proceedings, counsel provided defendant with meaningful representation (see People v Cain, 29 AD3d 1032, 1033 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 786 [2006] ).\nReviewing defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, she inaccurately argues that County Court erred in denying her request for a Darden hearing. In fact, the court in its written decision expressly reserved decision on the request until after the suppression hearing (subject to defendant\u2019s renewed request) and defendant never made any renewed request before pleading guilty. Thus, by pleading guilty while the motion was still pending, defendant waived appellate review of that issue (see People v Atwood, 9 AD3d 512, 513 [2004]; People v Deliz, 172 AD2d 877, 878-879 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 921 [1991]; cf. CPL 470.05 [2]).\nIn any event, at the suppression hearing, the identity of the informant whose statement supported the warrant application was revealed, thereby obviating the need for an in camera hearing to establish the existence of the informant or to protect her identity (see People v Edwards, 95 NY2d 486, 492-494 [2000]; People v Serrano, 93 NY2d 73, 77 [1999]). Further, the hearing testimony established that the warrant application sufficiently demonstrated the reliability and basis of knowledge of the informant (see People v Griminger, 71 NY2d 635, 639 [1988]), as it was supported by her sworn statement to police\u2014containing admissions against her penal interest (see People v Walker, 27 AD3d 899, 900 [2006]), lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006])\u2014which was corroborated by information gained earlier from two other confidential informants and confirmed by police investigation (see People v Collins, 35 AD3d 896, 897-898 [2006]; see also People v Bahr, 35 AD3d 909 [2006]). Thus, probable cause for the warrant was established (see People v Alston, 1 AD3d 627, 628-629, [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 594 [2004]; see also People v Rodriguez, 52 NY2d 483, 489-490 [1981]).\nFinally, finding no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances to warrant modification of the bargained-for sentence, we decline to disturb it in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; see also People v Rutledge, 282 AD2d 870 [2001]). Defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the amendments to the Rockefeller drug laws as they pertain to class A-II felons are appropriately made to the sentencing court (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.71; see also People v Syrell, 31 AD3d 881, 882 [2006]).\nMercure, J.P., Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Although the defendant's oral waiver of the right to appeal was deemed unenforceable due to insufficient understanding of the waiver's implications, the court found her plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. Additionally, the court rejected her claims regarding the denial of a Darden hearing and found that probable cause for the warrant had been established, thus upholding the sentence without modification.</s>"}

Thereafter, on May 28, 1996, defendant was arraigned and counsel was assigned to represent him. Defense counsel filed two motions and eventually, on June 4, 1996, the People filed their notice of readiness for trial. On July 8, 1997, defendant entered pleas of guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the remaining counts. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of six years to life. Defendant now appeals contending that his constitutional right to a speedy trial (see, CPL 30.20) was violated.\nWe begin by acknowledging that the constitutional right to a speedy trial may, indeed, be surrendered (see, People v Rodriguez, 50 NY2d 553, 557). Since, as defendant readily concedes, prior to the entry of his guilty pleas he made no motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground of denial of the right to a speedy trial, defendant has waived this claim (see, People v Lawrence, 64 NY2d 200, 203-204; People v Jordan, 62 NY2d 825, 826; People v Gates, 238 AD2d 729, 731, lv denied 90 NY2d 905; see also, CPL 210.20 [1] [g]; [2]; 210.45 [1]). In any event, mere delay, which is in essence all that the record in this case reflects, is insufficient by itself to constitute a meritorious claim for violation of the right to a speedy trial (see, People v Taranovich, 37 NY2d 442, 444-447; People v Kindlon, 217 AD2d 793, 794, lv denied 86 NY2d 844).\nCardona, P.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nYesawich Jr., J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered August 14, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant, then 16 years old, was charged with 16 separate drug-related crimes, arising from eight separate sales of cocaine or heroin. He pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all charges and was promised a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years. The sentence, however, was conditioned upon defendant not committing any further crimes between the date of the plea and sentencing. Prior to sentencing, County Court was advised that defendant had assaulted two inmates in the Montgomery County Jail. Following defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a hearing on these charges, County Court sentenced him to serve 5 to 15 years. Defendant appeals.\nInasmuch as defendant has not made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the sufficiency of his guilty plea on appeal (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, 977, lv denied 88 NY2d 994). Were we to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea, we would find on the record before us that defendant, who was effectively represented, entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea, which included a relinquishment of his appeal rights (see, People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769). The transcript of the plea allocution discloses that County Court provided defendant with a detailed explanation of the ramifications of pleading guilty and that he fully understood the court\u2019s explanation. Defendant has thus waived his right to challenge the severity of the sentence or County Court\u2019s refusal to adjudicate him a youthful offender (see, People v Gaines, 234 AD2d 712).\nIn any event, given defendant\u2019s pervasive involvement in illegal drug trafficking and the fact that some of the drug sales providing the basis for the indictment took place while defendant was on probation, County Court cannot be charged with abusing its discretion in declining to adjudicate him a youthful offender. Nor is the sentence he received unduly harsh or excessive. Not unimportantly, defendant agreed to the enhanced s\u00e9ntence of 5 to 15 years, in satisfaction of the charges contained in the indictment as well as the assault charges. Moreover, that sentence is less than the harshest penalty permissible under the statute. In sum, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Nardi, supra; People v Vasquez, 231 AD2d 755).\nMikoll, J. P., White, Casey and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal concerns a judgment from the County Court of Montgomery County, where the defendant, a 16-year-old, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree amid multiple drug-related charges. Despite being sentenced to 5 to 15 years due to committing further crimes while awaiting sentencing, the court found that the defendant had effectively waived his right to challenge the plea's sufficiency or the sentence's severity. The court affirmed the sentence, deeming it appropriate given the defendant's extensive involvement in drug trafficking and prior probation violations.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMcCarthy, J.\nIn 1999, defendant, a resident alien who had legally entered the United States, pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court (Leaman, J.) imposed six terms of 1 to 4 years in prison, three to run consecutively and three to run concurrently. Upon defendant\u2019s appeal challenging only the harshness of his sentence, this Court affirmed (People v Reynoso, 11 AD3d 719 [2004]). In 2010, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his conviction. County Court (Nichols, J.) denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals by permission.\nDefendant contends that his plea was not knowing and voluntary, and that counsel was ineffective, because counsel did not discuss any defenses \u2014 namely agency and entrapment \u2014 with defendant, informed defendant that he had no defenses, misinformed him concerning the deportation consequences of his plea, and pressured him to plead guilty. Initially, defendant\u2019s al legations were properly raised in a CPL 440.10 motion because they rely on information outside the record of the plea proceedings and therefore could not have been raised on direct appeal (see People v Hickey, 277 AD2d 511, 511-512 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 964 [2000]; see also People v Lafoe, 75 AD3d 663, 664 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 953 [2010]; compare CPL 440.10 [2] [c]). County Court properly discounted the allegations that defendant was pressured to plead guilty, as those allegations were conclusory and not factually supported.\nCounty Court properly denied a hearing on the aspects of defendant\u2019s motion concerning defenses. A court may deny a CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing if \u201c[a]n allegation of fact essential to support the motion ... is contradicted by a court record ... or is made solely by the defendant . . . [and] there is no reasonable possibility that such allegation is true\u201d (CPL 440.30 [4] [d]). At the beginning of the plea proceedings, defense counsel advised the court that he had specifically told defendant \u201cabout any defenses in this case,\u201d \u201c[i]n particular an agency defense,\u201d and that he would be waiving those defenses. During the plea colloquy, the court informed defendant that by pleading guilty he would be \u201cgiving up any and all defenses . . . including but not limited to the so called agency defense and the so called entrapment defense.\u201d Defendant acknowledged the court\u2019s warnings, did not ask any questions about the identified defenses, and stated that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. His current assertions that he was unaware of the agency and entrapment defenses are belied by the record, permitting the court to deny a hearing regarding those allegations.\nDefendant was entitled to a hearing, however, on the aspect of his motion alleging that counsel was deficient by providing incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences of the plea (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US \u2014, \u2014, 130 S Ct 1473, 1483 [2010]). As relevant here, federal law provides that any alien who is convicted of violating a state law \u201crelating to a controlled substance ... is deportable\u201d (8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). An alien convicted of illicit trafficking of controlled substances has committed an aggravated felony (see 8 USC \u00a7 1101 [a] [43] [B]), and is not eligible to have the United States Attorney General cancel his or her deportation (see 8 USC \u00a7 1229b [a] [3]). Thus, defendant\u2019s deportation was virtually mandated by his conviction for selling a controlled substance. According to defendant, however, his counsel advised him that he could avoid deportation if he pleaded guilty and appealed the sentence. Defendant\u2019s \u201cunderstanding was that if [he] appealed the sentence, by the time [he] was released from prison, [he] could no longer be deported.\u201d He also averred that had he known that a plea of guilty would definitely lead to deportation, he would not have pleaded guilty, but would have taken his chances at trial. Defendant sufficiently alleged that counsel provided incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences that would result from his plea, and that defendant was prejudiced because he would not have pleaded guilty had he been properly advised. Hence, defendant was entitled to a hearing on that aspect of his motion alleging that his judgment of conviction should be vacated because it was thereby tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel (see People v Williams, 72 AD3d 1347, 1348 [2010]; People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]).\nPeters, J.E, Spain, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur.

[/INST] In 1999, the defendant, a resident alien, pleaded guilty to multiple drug-related offenses and received a prison sentence. After appealing the harshness of his sentence, he later filed a motion to vacate his conviction, claiming his plea was not made knowingly and that he received ineffective counsel regarding potential defenses and the consequences of deportation. The court denied his motion without a hearing for most claims but found that he was entitled to a hearing regarding the alleged misinformation about deportation consequences, as it could have affected his decision to plead guilty. The appellate court reversed the lower court\u2019s order and remitted the case for further proceedings.</s>"}

Although defendant was initially to be sentenced on April 20, 2006, sentencing was adjourned until August 25, 2006 to provide him the opportunity to care for his wife during her high risk pregnancy.

Defendant contends that it is unclear whether the sentence provided for in the plea bargain relates to, inter alia, a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, filed in December 1995, as well as to a pending petit larceny charge. Defendant contends that because of this ambiguity, this Court cannot make a determination as to whether defendant\u2019s sentence was harsh and excessive. A review of the record indicates, however, that County Court explicitly stated that, among other things' all of the pending charges from December 1995 would be satisfied upon defendant entering a plea of guilty to the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, but that the charge of petit larceny was not a part of the plea bargain. In light of County Court\u2019s statements, we find that there was no ambiguity regarding which charges were satisfied by defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. Moreover, the record reveals that defendant showed no sign of confusion but, rather, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement (see, People v Di Rose, 210 AD2d 700, lv denied 85 NY2d 937).\nWhile defendant contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive and requests this Court to reduce it in the interest of justice, a review of the record reveals that defendant\u2019s sentence was agreed upon and within the statutory guidelines.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered March 27, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, he was to waive his right to appeal and be sentenced to a cap of one year of incarceration, followed by one year of postrelease supervision. In addition, County Court imposed certain conditions on the sentence advising defendant, among other things, that if he was arrested prior to sentencing, it would not be obligated to impose the agreed-upon sentence. Before sentencing, defendant was arrested on two separate occasions. Although defense counsel questioned the validity of these arrests, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, based upon defendant\u2019s violation of the sentencing conditions. Defendant declined to complete his signing of the written waiver of his right to appeal at sentencing and he now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole challenge is to County Court\u2019s imposition of the enhanced sentence based upon his two arrests. When the validity of a postplea arrest is called into question, \u201cthe court must conduct an inquiry at which the defendant has an opportunity to show that the arrest is without foundation\u201d (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993], cert denied 519 US 964 [1996]; see People v Fiammegta, 14 NY3d 90, 97 [2010]; People v Smalls, 85 AD3d 1450, 1451 [2011]). Significantly, \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the inquiry \u2014 whether through a summary hearing pursuant to CPL 400.10 or some other fair means \u2014 is within the court\u2019s discretion [but it] must be of sufficient depth, ... so that the court can be satisfied ... of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest\u201d (People v Outley, 80 NY2d at 713 [internal citation omitted]).\nHere, County Court did not conduct a formal evidentiary hearing regarding the validity of defendant\u2019s two arrests, and one was not required (see id. at 713; People v Talbot, 114 AD3d 1000, 1001 [2014]). Instead, the court made an on-the-record inquiry during the sentencing proceeding at which it considered the accusatory instruments, supporting documentation and arguments of counsel before concluding that a legitimate basis existed for defendant\u2019s arrests. Under the circumstances presented, we conclude that County Court\u2019s inquiry was adequate and established that a legitimate basis existed for defendant\u2019s arrests thereby warranting its imposition of the enhanced sentence (see People v Talbot, 114 AD3d at 1001; People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231[2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1023 [2014]).\nPeters, P.J., Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nCounty Court denied defendant\u2019s oral motion to withdraw his plea at sentencing.

As part of the plea, defendant executed a comprehensive written waiver of the right to appeal. In addition to enumerating specific rights, the waiver contained a catch-all provision stating that defendant waived \u201c[a]ny other matters which [she] may . . . appeal as of right or otherwise.\u201d Defendant was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 2 to 6 years in prison. She now appeals.\nDefendant initially contends that the waiver is void in its entirety because its catch-all language encompassed issues that are nonwaivable. We find this argument to be without merit. Where a waiver of the right to appeal encompasses issues that are nonwaivable, this Court has excluded such issues from the scope of the waiver but otherwise upheld its validity (see People v Umber, 2 AD3d 1051, 1052 [2003]; People v Cridelle, 283 AD2d 775, 775 [2001]). Defendant\u2019s reliance on People v Muniz (91 NY2d 570 [1998]) is misplaced. Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, that case does not require that a waiver expressly preserve a defendant\u2019s right to appeal all nonwaivable claims (see id. at 574). Inasmuch as the plea and waiver were entered into by defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently, the waiver is valid and enforceable.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by her valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Shaw, 309 AD2d 1074 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 601 [2004]). In any event, were we to consider this claim, we would find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Sampson, 301 AD2d 677, 678 [2003]; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 815 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]).\nCardona, EJ., Crew III, Feters and Kane, JJ., concur.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 8, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nDefendant, a native of Laos who speaks English with some difficulty, was indicted and charged with one count each of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first, second and third degrees for events occurring on three different dates. Initially, County Court refused to accept the negotiated plea agreement because of defendant\u2019s indication that he had never transferred cocaine to undercover police officers. Four days later, the court accepted defendant\u2019s plea of guilty which included a waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is unpreserved for review since he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Rafter, 234 AD2d 711). Furthermore, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal, the case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation rule since, subsequent to defendant\u2019s statement casting doubt upon his guilt, County Court appropriately conducted a detailed inquiry to ensure that defendant had committed the crime to which he was pleading guilty and that his plea was knowing and voluntary (see, People v Lopez, supra, at 666; People v Dobbins, 220 AD2d 234, lv denied 87 NY2d 921; see also, People v Woodberry, 216 AD2d 597, 598, lv denied 86 NY2d 805).\nSpecifically, an examination of the record reveals that, prior to accepting the plea, County Court not only required defendant to recite, in English, the events of the crime to which he was pleading, but also required defendant to tell the same information to his interpreter, in Laotian, which the interpreter then translated. During the colloquy, the court also repeatedly inquired, of defendant directly and through his interpreter, whether defendant understood what he was admitting and what rights he was forsaking by entering a plea of guilty; this included a review of the possible defense of entrapment. Rather than creating confusion, as defendant asserts, County Court\u2019s inquiries in dual languages are indicative of the detailed manner in which the plea allocution was conducted (see, People v Sosa, 226 AD2d 921; People v Mohammed, 208 AD2d 1118, 1119, lv denied 85 NY2d 941).\nCrew III, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

The appellate court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the defendant did not preserve any challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution for review.</s>"}

In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and four counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 to 12 years on each count. On appeal, defendant contends that (1) insufficient evidence was adduced at the Wade hearing to establish that the identification procedures were not tainted, (2) the possessory counts of the indictment should have been merged with the sales counts, (3) trial counsel was ineffective, and (4) the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nInitially, the plea minutes disclose that County Court fully apprised defendant of the ramifications of his guilty plea, including the fact that it encompassed a waiver of his right to appeal his conviction. Defendant fully understood the court\u2019s admonitions and entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to the subject crimes. The plea was entered prior to County Court rendering a decision in the Wade hearing. In view of this, as well as the fact that defendant neither moved to withdraw his plea nor vacate the judgment of conviction, we find that he has failed to preserve the identification issue and the merger issue for our review (see, People v Patterson, 208 AD2d 987; People v Brown, 156 AD2d 204; People v Quackenbush, 98 AD2d 875).\nAs to defendant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective, we find on the record before us that trial counsel provided defendant competent and meaningful representation, including securing him a favorable plea bargain. Therefore, we find this claim to be without merit (see, People v Santiago, 227 AD2d 657; People v Reid, 224 AD2d 728; People v Rodriquez, 221 AD2d 820, lv denied 87 NY2d 924).

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered April 7, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (nine counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts).\nDefendant challenges the severity of the sentence, which includes nine consecutive indeterminate prison terms of 3 years to life imposed upon his plea of guilty of nine counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, with an aggregate term of 27 years to life. Criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree is a serious crime that has a significant adverse impact upon the community, and defendant admitted during the presentence investigation that he was involved as an intermediary between street level dealers and large suppliers in an ongoing family cocaine trafficking enterprise. Accordingly, a lengthy period of incarceration was warranted, as was a harsher sentence than those imposed upon the two codefendants who acted as defendant\u2019s couriers.\nNevertheless, we are of the opinion that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of our authority to modify the sentence in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]). First, we note that County Court, in imposing this extremely severe sentence, relied, in large part, upon the conclusion that there was no likelihood that defendant could be rehabilitated. We find absolutely no record evidence to support such a conclusion. Accordingly, considering defendant\u2019s age, the absence of any prior convictions involving the sale or possession of drugs or any prior felony convictions, the absence of violence and defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of responsibility for his criminal conduct, we are persuaded that the sentence should be modified by reducing the aggregate indeterminate prison term to 15 years to life (see, People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908; People v Davis, 267 AD2d 597, 598-599; People v Sturgis, 202 AD2d 808, 810, lv denied 84 NY2d 833).\nPeters, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

[/INST] The appeal concerns a judgment from Columbia County convicting the defendant of multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, leading to a severe sentence of 27 years to life. The court found that the original sentence was excessively harsh given the absence of prior convictions, lack of evidence for rehabilitation concerns, and the defendant's acknowledgment of responsibility. Consequently, the court modified the sentence to 15 years to life, allowing some counts to run concurrently, and affirmed the modified judgment.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nKavanagh, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered October 15, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nIn June 2007, defendant was charged by indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and loitering in the first degree. After initially rejecting a plea offer, defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of all three counts contained in the indictment, and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision. At the time he entered his plea, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a written waiver to that effect with the assistance of counsel. At his sentencing, defendant stated that he was dissatisfied with counsel and claimed that he did not fully understand all of his rights when he entered his plea. County Court reviewed the content of defendant\u2019s plea allocution and, in particular, the description of the rights given to defendant that he agreed to waive when he entered his plea. After concluding that defendant had knowingly and intelligently entered his guilty plea, County Court imposed sentence pursuant to the terms of the negotiated plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, claiming that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel and his plea, as well as his waiver of the right to appeal, were involuntarily entered. Defendant also claims that his sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice.\nInitially, while defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not voluntary, the record reveals that the consequences of such a waiver were clearly and adequately explained to defendant by County Court and this explanation was reinforced by the content of a written waiver of appeal form that defendant executed with the assistance of counsel (see People v Lopez, 52 AD3d 852, 853 [2008]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]). Therefore, we find, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, that he voluntarily waived his right to appeal.\nDespite this finding, defendant\u2019s claim.of ineffective assistance of counsel survives the waiver of his right to appeal because, as made, it raises an issue as to the voluntariness of his guilty plea (see People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122,1124 [2009]; People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d 811, 812 [2008]; People v Morelli, 46 AD3d 1215, 1217 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008]). Having reviewed this claim, we find that it is belied by the record. Specifically, defendant argues that his counsel advised him to plead guilty before ever reviewing a laboratory report regarding the findings of a chemical analysis of the substance found on defendant\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest. However, the record establishes that defense counsel was, in fact, provided with a report of a field test performed at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest that found that the substance in his possession tested positive for the presence of crack cocaine. In addition, during his plea allocution, County Court inquired, and defendant confirmed, that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel prior to entering the plea, was satisfied with his representation, and was under no emotional or medical disability or under the influence of any substance that prevented him from making an intelligent and voluntary decision to enter a guilty plea. Moreover, defense counsel was able to negotiate an advantageous plea agreement that enabled defendant to plead guilty to a reduced charge in full satisfaction of all of the charges pending against him. Therefore, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that he did not receive meaningful representation of counsel or that his plea was not voluntarily entered (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781-782 [2009]; People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d at 813; People v Lopez, 52 AD3d at 853; People v Henning, 2 AD3d 979, 980 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 740 [2004]).\nFinally, as defendant executed a valid waiver of his right to appeal, his claim that the bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded (see People v Borom, 55 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2008]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058-1059 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]).\nMercure, J.E, Spain, Malone Jr. and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nFor the purposes of preservation, we conclude that defendant\u2019s pro se challenge to the effectiveness of his counsel before County Court at sentencing constituted a motion to vacate his plea and, therefore, preserved this claim for the purposes of appeal (see People v Rubeo, 60 AD3d 1206, 1207 [2009]; People v Dawson, 278 AD2d 665, 667 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 799 [2001]). [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, following his guilty plea. Despite the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that his plea was involuntary, the court found that he had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal, and the record indicated that he had sufficient representation.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered October 11, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was charged in a multicount indictment with various drug-related crimes arising from his sale of narcotics on four separate occasions in the City of Amsterdam, Montgomery County. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to 31/2 to 101/2 years in prison. On appeal, defendant argues, inter alia, that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.\nInitially, inasmuch as defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the sufficiency of his guilty plea on appeal (see, People v Comer, 236 AD2d 658; People v Miller, 234 AD2d 811; People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, lv denied 88 NY2d 994). Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of this claim, we would find it to be unavailing. The record discloses that County Court took painstaking efforts to explain to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the many rights he would be waiving as a result thereof. Although defendant had difficulty understanding the English language, County Court appointed a Spanish-speaking interpreter to assist defendant in understanding the proceedings and allowed defendant to confer with his attorney on a number of occasions to obtain further clarification. In answering the court\u2019s questions during the plea allocution, defendant indicated that he knew what was transpiring and wished to plead guilty of his own free will. Therefore, we find no basis for vacating the guilty plea (see, People v Comer, supra, at 658; People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, lv denied 89 NY2d 927; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, lv denied 89 NY2d 919; see also, People v Carmona, 111 AD2d 930).\nLikewise, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that defense counsel was ineffective. While defendant asserts that defense counsel should not have advised him to plead guilty but should have pursued the agency defense to the charges of sale of a controlled substance, we do not find that defense counsel\u2019s strategy amounts to ineffective assistance given defendant\u2019s admission to selling the drugs \"as a favor\u201d for his employer and his potential exposure to a much lengthier prison sentence if convicted after trial. Based upon our review of the record, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Comer, supra, at 658; People v Bass, 236 AD2d 651; People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments have been examined and found to be without merit or unpreserved for appellate review.\nMikoll, Crew III, Casey and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur.

Not only does defendant admit that he voluntarily pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, but two other charges were dropped as a result of the plea arrangement.

On June 23, 1995, defendant agreed to plead guilty to both crimes in exchange for County Court\u2019s commitment that he would receive concurrent terms of 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant was allowed to be released on his own recognizance for two weeks, but, prior to doing so, County Court made it clear that the sentence commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant appearing on the date set for sentencing. County Court specifically stated that, if defendant did not appear as scheduled, he would in effect be granting the court \u201cpermission to sentence [him] to anything the law would allow\u201d. Thereafter, defendant did not appear for sentencing and, when he was returned to court on a warrant two years later, County Court sentenced defendant to two consecutive prison terms of 6 to 18 years. This appeal followed.\nWe affirm. Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in not allowing him to withdraw his guilty pleas prior to imposition of the enhanced sentences. Defendant\u2019s argument in this regard is premised upon a discussion made in the context of a prior plea offer made before the superior court information was issued which defendant ultimately rejected. An examination of County Court\u2019s remarks on that date establishes that any promises made were tied to the rejected offer. Significantly, no mention of a possible withdrawal of the pleas was made with respect to the consequences if defendant violated any of the conditions set by the court (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, Iv denied 82 NY2d 718). Instead, defendant was informed by County Court that the consequence for breach of the requirement that he appear for the scheduled sentencing date would be an enhanced sentence (see, id.; see also, People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854). Since defendant violated the terms of the agreement by his nonappearance, a lengthier sentence was justified (see, People v Waldron, 257 AD2d 771).\nFinally, we have examined defendant\u2019s argument that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, and find it to be without merit given defendant\u2019s considerable criminal history and the particular circumstances involved here (see, id.).\nMikoll, J.

The court denied defendant\u2019s subsequent CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the order denying his motion.\nCounty Court did not inform defendant of the key rights he was forfeiting by pleading guilty rather than proceeding to trial. The court did not advise defendant of the potential sentencing range before accepting an open plea, so as to ensure that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and intelligent. Notably, postrelease supervision was not mentioned by anyone during the plea proceedings. Due to these omissions during the plea colloquy, the court could not be assured that defendant had a full understanding of the plea and its consequences (see People v Thomas, 68 AD3d 1445, 1447 [2009]). \u201cBecause a defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action, the failure of a court to advise of post-release supervision requires reversal of the conviction\u201d (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]).

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to fours years in prison, to be followed by an undisclosed period of postrelease supervision. At sentencing, County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of imprisonment, along with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea should be vacated as it was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent due to the fact that he was not advised of the specific length of mandatory postrelease supervision prior to sentencing.\nWe reverse. Initially, as defendant\u2019s challenge relates to the voluntariness of his plea, it survives any appeal waiver (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 888 [2010]).

Turning to the merits, \u201c[a] defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action\u201d (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; accord People v Wade, 86 AD3d 713, 714 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 823 [2011]). Moreover, \u201c[i]n order to satisfy the demands of due process, a defendant must be aware of not only the existence of the postrelease supervision component to a sentence, but also the promised or potential duration of that component if a negotiated sentence is a part of the plea agreement\u201d (People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232). Here, the record reflects, as the People concede, that while the plea agreement included a specific negotiated sentence and a mention of postrelease supervision, defendant was never advised by the court of either a promised specific duration or the potential range of the mandatory postrelease supervision component prior to sentencing. Accordingly, his decision to plead guilty was not a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one and, therefore, the judgment of conviction must be reversed and the plea vacated (see People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232).\nLahtinen, J.P., McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

In exchange for the opportunity to participate in the judicial diversion program (hereinafter JDP), defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and to a violation of the terms of her probation and waived her right to appeal.

Defendant further acknowledged that she understood that she could not waive particular appellate rights, including any constitutional challenge based on her speedy trial right, the legality of the sentence, her own competency to stand trial and the voluntariness of her appeal waiver. Regardless of the fact that defendant never confirmed that she read and understood the written appeal waiver that she thereafter executed, this colloquy established that her waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Empey, 144 AD3d 1201, 1203 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1144 [2017]; People v Munger, 117 AD3d 1343, 1343 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1040 [2014]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr., Mulvey, Aarons and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nKane, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, Jr., J.), rendered July 14, 2004, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.\nDefendant was indicted for several crimes related to her sale and possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia. When County Court arraigned her on the indictment on January 14, 2004, she was represented by counsel who had apparently been assigned by City Court after defendant\u2019s arrest. After defendant expressed her desire to hire a different attorney, County Court informed her that she and her attorney needed to be aware of the 45-day time limit to file motions. Assigned counsel appeared with defendant at a January 29, 2004 conference, where she rejected an offer to plead to a reduced charge and receive a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. Defendant apparently attempted to retain private counsel, but was unsuccessful. On March 22, 2004, assigned counsel filed demands for a bill of particulars and discovery, but he did not file an omnibus motion until May 28, 2004. The court denied the motion as untimely and adhered to that decision upon reargument. After the jury convicted defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, the court imposed a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years on the felony count and concurrent one-year sentences on the misdemeanor counts. Defendant appeals.\nCounty Court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s omnibus motion as untimely. All pretrial motions must be filed within 45 days of arraignment, unless the defendant is not represented by counsel and has requested an adjournment to obtain counsel or have counsel assigned, in which case the 45-day period will begin when counsel appears on defendant\u2019s behalf (see CPL 255.20 [1]). The statutory exception does not apply to defendant because she was represented by assigned counsel and never requested an adjournment to retain private counsel. Although defendant argues that assigned counsel did not represent her for a period while she made inquiries regarding retaining new counsel, assigned counsel remained counsel of record since neither defendant nor assigned counsel moved to have assigned counsel relieved by the court. Even if we accepted defendant\u2019s contention that she was unrepresented for a period of time, assigned counsel certainly represented her when he filed demands for discovery and a bill of particulars and when he filed the omnibus motion more than 45 days following those demands. Hence, the omnibus motion was untimely and the court was authorized to summarily deny it (see CPL 255.20 [3]; People v Augustine, 235 AD2d 915, 916 [1997], appeal dismissed 89 NY2d 1072 [1997], lv denied 89 NY2d 1088 [1997]).\nA court may summarily deny any pretrial motions filed after the 45-day period, although the court, in the interest of justice and for good cause shown, has the discretion to entertain untimely motions on the merits (see CPL 255.20 [3]; People v Davidson, 98 NY2d 738, 739 [2002]). We cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to entertain the omnibus motion on its merits where, as here, defendant failed to show good cause for her delay in filing the motion (see People v Augustine, supra at 916-917), and counsel made the motion returnable on the day fixed for jury selection.\nFinally, defendant\u2019s sentence was not harsh or excessive. She was on probation for a similar charge at the time that she committed these crimes and County Court imposed less than half the maximum permissible sentence. We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the court unfairly punished her by imposing a longer sentence than the one offered as part of a plea bargain (see People v Castle, 251 AD2d 891, 893 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 923 [1998]). The offer was to plead guilty to a class D felony as a reduced charge. A longer sentence is justified by her conviction of a class B felony and two misdemeanors. The lesser offer prior to trial also reflected the People\u2019s acknowledgment of their risk in going to trial with a drug addict as a primary prosecution witness, a circumstance that was not a factor after trial (compare People v Morton, 288 AD2d 557, 559 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 758 [2002], cert denied 537 US 860 [2002]).\nCrew III, J.P., Spain, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014Harvey, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered April 5, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nDefendant was out on parole on an unrelated felony when he was arrested and later charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following plea negotiations, defendant agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an unrelated misdemeanor charge. In exchange, defendant was to be given a prison sentence of 3\u00bd to 7 years. Because defendant was a second felony offender and he had been out on parole for an unfulfilled sentence at the time of the new arrest, it was explained to defendant that his new sentence had to be consecutive to his unfulfilled sentence (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2-a]). Prior to the conclusion of the proceedings defense counsel reserved the right to withdraw the plea if the sentence was not as understood. At sentencing, defendant\u2019s attorney was not present and a Legal Aid attorney was substituted. When defendant seemed a little confused by the proceedings, County Court offered to adjourn sentencing until the following Monday when defendant\u2019s original attorney could be present. After thinking the matter over, defendant agreed to be sentenced at that time in accordance with the plea bargain. This appeal followed.\nDefendant\u2019s argument that his plea was neither knowing nor voluntary was not preserved for appellate review because defendant failed to move in County Court to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Strohecker, 170 AD2d 891; People v McGourty, 153 AD2d 991). In any event, our review of the minutes and terms of the plea bargain reveals no basis for reversal on this ground. While defendant correctly states that \"the breach of a promise made to induce a guilty plea entitles a defendant to either withdraw his plea or be resentenced\u201d by a different sentencing court (People v Felman, 137 AD2d 341, 343, lv denied 72 NY2d 918), in this case no promises were in fact breached (see, People v Henderson, 145 AD2d 676, 677, lv denied 73 NY2d 978). Specifically the consecutive sentence for the agreed-upon crime was clearly stated in the record as required by CPL 220.50 (5). Although it is true that the question of how much jail time defendant might receive as a result of the time he had already spent in jail was briefly discussed, defendant is incorrect in asserting that County Court made a promise in this respect. In fact, since credit for jail time in defendant\u2019s circumstance is provided for by statute (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.30 [3]), no promises could have been made and our review reveals that none in fact were made.

Judgment affirmed. There is no need to resolve the question of when the prosecutor should have apprised defendant of the existence of \"twenty something\u201d additional tapes, since the fact is that (as shown in the voir dire transcripts) defense counsel, after having conducted his voir dire of the jury, was apprised of the additional tapes and was given an opportunity \u2014which he utilized\u2014to examine them. Prejudice might have resulted from this alleged eleventh hour disclosure of the additional tapes only if defense counsel had not been granted the right to inspect them or, if having inspected them, he had been denied a mistrial, or had been granted a mistrial solely on the condition which the defendant claims the prosecutor imposed, viz., that the defenses of entrapment and agency be waived. At bar, however, it is manifest from the voir dire minutes and the plea and sentence minutes that, on the basis of the examination of the additional tapes, defendant and his counsel concluded that there was no merit to their proposed defenses and that the best course for defendant would be to enter the proffered guilty plea and obtain the sentence which was ultimately imposed. Thus, at page 31 of the voir dire minutes of May 6, 1977 defense counsel stated: \"I saw some tapes yesterday; of course, they weren\u2019t originals. They were handwritten. The language is incomprehensible to me but in talking with the police officers, and in talking With Miss Brill, the jury might easily infer certain things which might be inhumanible [sic] to a defense of entrapment. Again, I say it\u2019s a matter of interpretation. Now I could not ethically urge that defense in the light of what I have since found. I also, Your Honor, wish to absolve Miss Brill of any ill doing in this case. I\u2019m sure that as just as soon as she found out about the tapes, she came rushing into Court just like they do on the T.V. I say that because Miss Brill kept talking about T.V., that nothing traumaticly [sic] is going to happen, and in fact, it did. I assure the Court that had I been aware of those tapes, I would not have urged the defense of entrapment.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County, rendered June 30, 1976, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a mandatory maximum of life and a minimum of six years. Defendant\u2019s principal contention on this appeal is that, because he disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s outline of his involvement in the crimes charged, the trial court erred in failing to inquire into the facts of the crime at the time of his guilty plea. An examination of the record discloses that the trial court questioned defendant thoroughly and was satisfied that he fully understood the consequences of changing his plea to guilty. The defendant admitted that he knew that he could receive a minimum sentence of 15 years upon conviction of the first count of the indictment. When asked by the court why he was pleading guilty, defendant replied that the guilty plea was to his benefit since it removed the possibility of a much longer minimum sentence imposable upon conviction of the first degree offense charged in the indictment. The trial court is not bound in every situation to catechize a defendant about his guilt. The record establishes that defendant was represented by retained competent counsel of his own choice and was fully aware of the effect of his plea (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338; People v Seaton, 19 NY2d 404; People v Fierro, 50 AD2d 1013). Defendant also raises a challenge to the composition of the jury panel. However, defendant by his voluntary plea with advice of counsel, waived his right to a trial by jury (Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238). He was given ample time to examine the permanent jury list when his trial was put over to the next term after his challenge to the jury panel was denied. Defendant failed to utilize this additional time but chose instead to plead guilty to the lesser offense. There is no merit to defendant\u2019s remaining contention that article 220 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional since cocaine is \"a relatively harmless drug\u201d. The Court of Appeals has held that the sentencing statutes under article 220 do not impose cruel and unusual punishment (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). Judgment affirmed.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014Spain, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 25, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nPursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and, as part of the agreement, was sentenced to a prison term of six years to life. Consistent with the agreement, a second criminal indictment (which had been consolidated with the first), charging him with possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and resisting arrest, was dismissed. Defendant appeals, contending that his sentence must be vacated because it resulted from a plea agreement which was made at a time when both sides and County Court were laboring under the misapprehension that defendant was already an adjudicated felon, thereby rendering him subject to the enhanced sentencing guidelines applicable to second felony offenders for whom the agreed-upon sentence of six years to life was, by statute, the minimum prison term (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [4] [a]).\nAt the outset, it is conceded that the presentence report, prepared during the interim between the plea and sentencing hearings, does not include any information to support the conclusion that defendant had ever before been convicted of a felony, but disclosed only that he had two prior misdemeanor convictions and a youthful offender adjudication. However, at the plea allocution, defense counsel demonstrated his misapprehension of defendant\u2019s status as a second felony offender by stating that under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant would be sentenced to a prison term of six years to life, which he characterized as representing \u201cthe minimum [permissible sentence for] * * * a second felony offender.\u201d County Court appears to have been similarly misinformed, in that it explained to defendant that by pleading guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, he would receive a prison sentence representing \u201cthe minimum for a two felony offender that being a minimum of six years and a maximum of your natural life.\u201d\nAt the sentencing hearing, no additional statements were made by the prosecution, defense counsel or County Court indicating that defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender. He was then sentenced to the previously agreed-upon prison term of six years to life, a sentence which was the minimum for a second felony offender, but which was also within the permissible statutory limits for a first-time felony offender such as defendant (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]). Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, but appealed from the judgment, challenging only his sentence.\nOn appeal, defendant makes no argument to undermine his conviction, but he seeks a reduction in his sentence from this Court or, in the alternative, remittal to County Court for resentencing. As previously noted, the sentence was within the permissible statutory limits for a first-time felon and defendant was not erroneously adjudicated a second felony offender, having been sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement. Accordingly, the sentence was not per se illegal and, as such, defendant was required to timely register an objection to the sentence before County Court to preserve the issue for appellate review (see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52, 56-57). Defendant failed to make the requisite objection.\nTroubled by the universal misunderstanding apparent from the record that defendant was a second felony offender and, thus, would necessarily face a minimum possible sentence of six years \u2014 the statutory minimum for a second felony offender under Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (4) (a) \u2014 for the crime to which he pleaded guilty, we exercise our jurisdiction as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [3] [c]). In fact, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 (3) (a) (ii), defendant, as a first-time felon, would have faced a three-year minimum sentence upon his conviction of this class A-II felony. As we are unable to ascertain from the record whether County Court would have imposed the same sentence had it been apprised of defendant\u2019s actual status or whether, as defendant contends, the court intended to sentence defendant to the minimum permissible sentence, we remit to permit County Court to exercise its discretion for resentencing or any other action deemed appropriate (see People v Predmore, 142 AD2d 759, 759-760; cf. People v Housman, 291 AD2d 665, 666, lv denied 98 NY2d 638; People v Febos, 122 AD2d 497, 498, lv denied 68 NY2d 812).\nMercure, J.P., Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Under the terms of the plea agreement that was approved by County Court, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to the minimum of six years in prison.

Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon prison term and imposed a three-year period of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole challenge is to County Court\u2019s imposition of a three-year period of postrelease supervision, which he contends is an abuse of discretion and is also harsh and excessive. We disagree. Given that no particular period of post-release supervision was included in the plea agreement, County Court retained the discretion to determine the length of the term and did not violate the sentencing commitment by selecting the maximum of three years. Notably, the record reveals that defendant has a lengthy criminal record, is a prior parole violator and could have been sentenced to a much lengthier prison term if convicted of the charges contained in the amended indictment. In view of this, and given that defendant was sentenced to the minimum term of imprisonment, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting modification of the period of postrelease supervision (see People v Foulkes, 117 AD3d 1176, 1177-1178 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1084 [2014]; People v Watson, 115 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]).\nGarry, J.P., Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an unindicted charge. His guilty plea included a waiver of the right to appeal.

Defendant later waived indictment and was charged by superior court information with an additional charge of arson in the third degree. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of arson in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of all outstanding charges and waived his right to appeal with regard thereto. County Court thereafter sentenced him in accordance with the revised plea agreement to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the maximum being a term of 4 to 12 years, and ordered him to pay restitution. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. With regard to defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, to the extent that such claim is alleged to have impacted the voluntariness of his plea, it survives his appeal waiver; however, it is not preserved for our review as the record does not reflect that he moved to withdraw his plea (see People v Ortiz, 127 AD3d 1416, 1417 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]) and the narrow excep tion to the preservation requirement is inapplicable inasmuch as defendant made no statements during his plea colloquy that would cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Van Clief, 122 AD3d 1062, 1063 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1221 [2015]). Further, to the extent that defendant contends that counsel made certain misrepresentations regarding the terms of the plea agreement, such claims involve matters outside the record and, therefore, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061-1062 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [2015]; People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1271 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]).\nAdditionally, upon review of the plea colloquy and defendant\u2019s written waiver, we find that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Viele, 130 AD3d 1097, 1097 [2015]). In light of defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver, defendant is precluded from challenging the agreed-upon sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Tyler, 130 AD3d 1383, 1385 [2015]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr. and Devine, JJ., concur.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He was sentenced accordingly and he now appeals.\nDefendant asserts that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. While a valid waiver of the right to appeal precludes a defendant from raising such a claim (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1385 [2010]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1292 [2010]), we do not find that the waiver made by defendant here was valid. Notably, when the plea agreement was initially presented, the waiver was not referenced even though County Court specifically asked the parties if the recitation constituted the full agreement. In addition, although defendant gave an affirmative response when asked if he waived his right to appeal, the record does not indicate that he fully understood this right, that County Court comprehensively explained its nature as separate and distinct from the other rights defendant was waiving, or that defendant discussed the issue with counsel. Therefore, the waiver was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Middleton, 72 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2010]; see also People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]).\nNevertheless, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record, and he was apprehended while selling 28 envelopes of heroin to an undercover police officer. In view of this, and given that he was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]).\nMercure, J.E, Spain, Lahtinen, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMahoney, P. J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered September 1, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of five counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to five reduced charges of second degree criminal sale of a controlled substance. This plea was in full satisfaction of five separate indictments charging him with first degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and an unindicted charge of assault stemming from an incident while defendant was in jail. Defendant was subsequently sentenced to five concurrent prison terms of nine years to life. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant initially argues that he was denied due process by County Court\u2019s failure to order a hearing to determine his mental competence. Such a hearing, however, must be premised on an objective determination by the court that a reasonable ground exists to doubt defendant\u2019s competence (see, Peo ple v Gensler, 72 NY2d 239, 245, cert denied 488 US 932; People v Armlin, 37 NY2d 167, 168). Here, both the plea colloquy and sentencing minutes fail to proffer any objective indication that County Court erred in not ordering a hearing. We note further that, between the entering of his guilty plea and sentencing, defendant was sent to a psychiatric center by authorities at the County Jail, apparently in response to a perceived suicide risk. Defendant was released therefrom and, at the time of sentencing, the court took notice of a psychiatric report rendered on defendant\u2019s discharge which stated that defendant was alert, fully oriented, cooperative and exhibiting \"no psychotic thinking\u201d. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb the court\u2019s ruling in this regard (see, People v Carbone, 159 AD2d 511, lv denied, 76 NY2d 732).\nWe have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find all to lack merit. As noted in the People\u2019s brief on appeal, however, defendant was erroneously sentenced on his conviction for class A-II felonies (Penal Law \u00a7 220.41 [7]) to a minimum term of imprisonment of nine years despite the statutory ceiling therefor of eight years and four months (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). The sentence should therefore be reduced (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 238, cert denied 419 US 1122; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d 920). Although we generally remit cases where a plea is entered in return for a bargained-for sentence later revealed as unlawful (see, People v West, 80 AD2d 680, 681), in this instance we choose to correct the sentence in accordance with the lawful minimum (see, CPL 470.15 [4] [c]).\nYesawich Jr., Levine, Mercure and Crew III, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the sentence imposed to five concurrent prison terms of 8 Ms years to life, and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] In this case, the defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court of Schenectady County, where he pleaded guilty to five counts of second-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and was sentenced to five concurrent prison terms of nine years to life.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nSpain, J.\nAppeals from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered February 6, 2012, (1) upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and (2) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of burglary in the third degree.\nAfter a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged of crim inal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree for selling oxycodone, a narcotic drug, to a confidential informant during a controlled buy overseen by law enforcement officers. At sentencing, defendant accepted a plea agreement pursuant to which he entered a guilty plea to burglary in the third degree in satisfaction of an unrelated eight-count indictment, admitted for all purposes that he was a second felony offender, and waived his right to appeal the conviction and sentence in both cases. The plea also satisfied another four-count indictment that was scheduled for trial charging him with evidence tampering and other crimes. In exchange, defendant was promised a sentence of 3V2 to 7 years in prison for the criminal sale conviction and no more than 10 years for the burglary conviction, with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon sentence on the criminal sale conviction, and to a concurrent term of 10 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on the burglary conviction. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, upon review of the record, we find that, contrary to defendant\u2019s contentions, his guilty plea and appeal waivers were knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Brown, 14 NY3d 113, 116 [2010]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Morales, 68 AD3d 1356, 1356-1357 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 803 [2010] [waived appeal as to both a jury verdict and an unrelated plea as part of one negotiated deal]; People v Cipriani, 61 AD3d 1214, 1215 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009] [same]). County Court outlined all of the terms of the plea agreement on the record, explained the consequences of the guilty plea and the trial-related rights that defendant was forgoing, and elicited his understanding of each of the terms. When a question arose as to whether the appeal waiver would apply to both the criminal sale and the burglary convictions, the court took a recess and conferred with the parties, following which the court placed on the record the parties\u2019 understanding that defendant would be waiving his right to appeal all aspects of both convictions with two specified qualifications (see People v Morales, 68 AD3d at 1357). Defendant then admitted the acts constituting burglary in the third degree and the court engaged in an extended colloquy before accepting his guilty plea to the burglary count. During that allocution, the court explained the appeal waiver, advising that a defendant may \u201cordinarily appeal any decision, [o]rder, or ruling of the court which he [or she] believes to be legally incorrect or otherwise inappropriate\u201d but that, as a separate part of his plea agreement, defendant would be required, as agreed, to waive his right to appeal \u201call aspects of the proceeding except any of a constitutional nature and . . . any violation] by the court of its sentencing commitment;\u201d defendant expressly agreed to the appeal waiver as to the burglary conviction. The court then separately elicited defendant\u2019s agreement to the identical qualified appeal waiver as to the criminal sale conviction, after ascertaining that he had discussed the waiver with counsel, who was satisfied that defendant understood it. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s appellate claims, the court carefully explained the appeal waiver and distinguished it from the other rights that defendant was forgoing as a consequence of his guilty plea, established that defense counsel had discussed it with him, engaged defendant in separate appeal waiver colloquies as to each conviction, and did not mislead him as to the plea terms or scope of the appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1378-1379 [2013]).\nGiven that County Court \u201cma[de] certain that . . . defendant\u2019s understanding of the terms and conditions of [the] plea agreement [were] evident on the face of the record,\u201d which reflects \u201cthat [the appeal waivers were] made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily,\u201d they will be given full effect (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; see People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]). As a consequence of \u201cpleading guilty and waiving the right to appeal, . . . defendant has forgone review of the terms of the plea, including the harshness or excessiveness of the sentence\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Likewise, defendant\u2019s nonconstitutional challenges to the court\u2019s Molineux ruling are encompassed within and precluded by his appeal waiver (see People v Barrier, 7 AD3d 885, 886 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 670 [2004]; see also People v Morales, 68 AD3d at 1357), as is his contention regarding the court\u2019s admission into evidence of the tape recording and transcript of the drug sale (see People v Mercer, 81 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 999 [2012]).\nDefendant\u2019s argument that his right to confront witnesses against him at trial under the 6th Amendment was violated is a constitutional claim that he reserved in his qualified appeal waiver, but we find that it has no merit. Defendant contends that County Court erred when it admitted into evidence the controlled substance report documenting that the substance in issue was oxycodone, where Clifford Brant, the State Police forensic scientist who performed the chemical analysis and prepared the report, testified at trial, but his supervisor, Margaret Lafond \u2014 who cosigned the report \u2014 did not testify. The Confrontation Clause of the 6th Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees a defendant in a criminal prosecution the right to be \u201cconfronted with witnesses against him [or her]\u201d (US Const 6th Amend), which precludes the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he [or she] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant. . . had a prior opportunity for cross-examination\u201d (Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 53-54 [2004]). The US Supreme Court held in Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts (557 US 305 [2009]) that a sworn report from a state laboratory identifying a substance for purposes of a criminal prosecution is testimonial, and that the analysts were witnesses for purposes of the 6th Amendment who the accused was entitled to confront (id. at 310-311). The Court further held that, absent proof that such analysts were unavailable and that the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, his right of confrontation was violated (id.; see Bullcoming v New Mexico, 564 US \u2014, \u2014, 131 S Ct 2705, 2716-2717 [2011]; People v Pealer, 20 NY3d 447, 453-454 [2013], cert denied 571 US \u2014, 134 S Ct 105 [2013]; People v Brown, 13 NY3d 332, 338-339 [2009]).\nHere, unlike Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, Brant \u2014 the analyst who identified the oxycodone, performed the chemical tests on it, determined the nature of the substance, and authored the report \u2014 in fact testified and was subject to cross-examination (see People v Raucci, 109 AD3d 109,121-122 [2013]; compare People v Morrison, 90 AD3d 1554, 1556-1557 [4th Dept 2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 1028 [2012], reconsideration denied 20 NY3d 934 [2012] [the analyst who performed the forensic tests and drew conclusions was not called to testify but, rather, the analyst\u2019s supervisor testified, who did not perform her own independent review or analysis]). The report is certified pursuant to CPL 190.30 (2) with the following language: \u201cI, Clifford E. Brant, . . . hereby certify\u201d and then states that it is \u201cmy [i.e. Brant\u2019s] report and contains the opinions and interpretations of the examination I performed in the above referenced case\u201d (emphasis added). Brant also testified that Lafond cosigned the report after an administrative review of it, as required by State Police protocol. There is no support in the record for the proposition that Lafond examined or analyzed the substance, observed Brant doing so, or was signing the report in that capacity. Indeed, Brant testified that after he alone performed the foren sic chemical testing, he sealed, signed and dated the laboratory bag containing the pill, which remained intact as of the trial, supporting the conclusion that Lafond only read and signed the report after it was completed to ensure that proper procedure was followed (see e.g. People v Morrison, 90 AD3d at 1556-1557), and she had no role in ascertaining or verifying the identity of the substance in issue. Thus, the \u201cactual analyst who performed the tests\u201d (id. at 1557) and \u201cwr[o]te [the] report[ ]\u201d (Bullcoming v New Mexico, 564 US at, 131 S Ct at 2715) testified. We find that Lafond, who neither analyzed the substance in issue nor authored the report, was not a \u201cwitness\u201d against defendant for purposes of the Confrontation Clause (cf. Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts, 557 US at 311) and, accordingly, no Crawford violation occurred as a result of the People admitting Brant\u2019s report into evidence without calling Lafond to testify.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining claims also lack merit.\nStein, J.E, McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nOrdinarily, issues that survive an appeal waiver include a challenge to the legality of the sentence (see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]) or any issue that \u201cinvolve[s] a right of constitutional dimension going to \u2018the very heart of the process\u2019 \u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255, quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]). Here, defendant expressly reserved all issues of a \u201cconstitutional nature\u201d from this appeal waiver. [/INST] The court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance and burglary. The defendant's guilty plea and waiver of appeal rights were deemed to have been made knowingly and voluntarily, as the court thoroughly explained the plea agreement and its implications. The defendant's constitutional claim regarding the right to confront witnesses was found to lack merit, as the analyst who prepared the drug report testified at trial, fulfilling the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.</s>"}

Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea, submitted on her behalf by a second assigned counsel after she expressed dissatisfaction with her original representation, was denied by County Court which subsequently imposed the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison. On this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court\u2019s denial of her motion to withdraw her guilty plea was improper because, as a result of her mental condition, she did not enter into the plea knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. She likewise maintains that she was denied the effective assistance of counsel.\n\u201cThe determination of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea lies within the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d (People v Morris, 30 AD3d 632, 632 [2006] [citations omitted]). Notably, the denial of such a motion is not an abuse of discretion, despite defendant\u2019s mental health condition, where the trial court has been aware of that condition throughout the proceedings and \u201cconducts a thorough inquiry ... to establish that, despite those deficiencies, defendant understood the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea and the motion to withdraw is based upon defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of lack of comprehension\u201d (People v D'Adamo, 281 AD2d 751, 752 [2001], lv denied 98 NY2d 730 [2002]).\nHere, notwithstanding the submission by defendant of documentary evidence attesting to her treatment for bipolar disorder, a review of the record reveals that County Court had been apprised of defendant\u2019s personal problems prior to its execution of a meticulous plea allocution, during which it acknowledged defendant\u2019s earlier discomfort with the proposed plea agreement and repeatedly ascertained her willingness to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter into such. Furthermore, despite defendant\u2019s protestations to the contrary, inasmuch as the record indicates that defense counsel competently protected her interests and, indeed, negotiated a very advantageous plea that she herself described as an \u201cexcellent offer,\u201d she cannot be said to have been deprived of meaningful representation (see People v La Porte, 31 AD3d 800, 801 [2006]).\nCarpinello, J.R, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal concerns a defendant who pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree as part of a plea agreement, despite originally facing more serious charges.

Defendant was ultimately acquitted of the charge on which he was initially arrested and he thereafter entered a plea of guilty of five counts of possessing an obscene performance by a child. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of lVs to 4 years in prison, and a fine of $10,000 was also imposed.\nOn appeal, defendant\u2019s attorney contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced. Defendant pro se contends that the conviction should be reversed. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s pro se arguments, but we agree that the sentence should be reduced.\nCounty Court found that defendant had accepted responsibility for possessing the pornographic material and after noting that the possession of the material is deserving of serious punishment to deter defendant and others from similar crimes, the court explained its sentencing rationale as follows: \u201cThe Court takes note of the favorable [presentence] report as well as numerous letters written on behalf of defendant. The Court takes further note of the circumstances in which the contraband was seized and notes that the contraband was, indeed, 20 some years old. But that, in my opinion, only goes to whether or not the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive and not to the fact that the defendant is deserving of a significant sentence. The very possession of this contraband, as the Legislature has decided, is so offensive, so heinous as to require this Court, in my opinion, to sentence [defendant to a prison term of lVs to 4 years on each count].\u201d\nThe crimes at issue are class E felonies (see, Penal Law \u00a7 263.11) and there were a number of authorized dispositions (see, Penal Law \u00a7 60.01), including an indeterminate sentence, with a maximum not exceeding four years and a minimum not exceeding one third of the maximum (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [e]; [3] [b]), or an alternative definite sentence (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [4]). In this case, County Court seemingly viewed the statutory scheme as requiring the imposition of a sentence of lVs to 4 years, while the Penal Law clearly establishes lVs to 4 years as the harshest possible sentence if the court decides to impose an indeterminate sentence. County Court compounded the error by limiting its consideration of relevant sentencing factors to the question of whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences. Those factors should have been considered not only on the issue of the appropriate indeterminate term for each count, but also on the question of whether this was an appropriate case for an alternative definite sentence pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 (4). By imposing the harshest possible indeterminate term for each count as though that were the sentence required by law, County Court failed to exercise the sentencing discretion granted by Penal Law \u00a7 70.00.\nIn these circumstances, and considering defendant\u2019s age, disability, lack of a recent criminal record and acceptance of responsibility for his crimes, together with the circumstances surrounding his possession of the material and the recommendation of the presentence report, we exercise our discretion to reduce the concurrent sentences to time served on each count (see, People v Smith, 222 AD2d 738). We are also of the view that the fine should be reduced to $2,000.\nHer cure, J. P., Spain, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed to time served and reducing the total fine to $2,000, and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] The court reviewed an appeal from a judgment convicting the defendant of five counts of possessing obscene sexual performances by a child after police discovered child pornography in his home.

During pretrial proceedings, County Court denied defendant\u2019s requests that Wade, Rodriguez and/or pretrial identification hearings be held to confirm that defendant was properly identified as having made the subject sale. Following pretrial discussions, defendant rejected all plea bargain offers and the matter proceeded to trial. The day following commencement of the trial, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, with the promise of an indeterminate prison term of SVa to 7 years.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that since defense counsel repeatedly questioned the reliability of the identification made by the confidential informant, County Court erred in denying his request for a Wade, Rodriguez and/or a pretrial identification hearing. Defendant\u2019s contention must be rejected. Defendant is entitled to a hearing to determine the admissibility of identification testimony where there has been a previous identification of the defendant by a prospective trial witness (see CPL 710.20 [6]). Here, the People served a CPL 710.30 notice which indicated that there would be no eyewitness testimony by any person who had previously identified the defendant as being the individual who committed the crime charged. Under these circumstances, the court\u2019s denial of a hearing was entirely proper.\nDefendant next argues that it was error for County Court to deny him a pretrial proceeding that would test the reliability of a proposed trial identification. Defendant\u2019s right to appellate review of this issue \u201craised before the plea is forfeited by operation of law as a consequence of a guilty plea\u201d (People v Campbell, 73 NY2d 481, 486; see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230; People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5; People v Perkins, 288 AD2d 506, 507, lv denied 97 NY2d 707). Upon review of the record, we find that County Court conducted an appropriate plea allocution wherein defendant\u2019s guilt was established by his knowing and voluntary plea. \u201cWhere a defendant has by his plea admitted commission of the crime with which he is charged, the plea more than a confession, signals defendant\u2019s intention not to litigate the question of his guilt * * *\u201d (People v Campbell, supra at 486 [citations omitted]), and the plea operates to extinguish any claims made prior to the plea (see People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 87-88, lv denied 98 NY2d 642). Furthermore, defendant\u2019s demand for a pretrial in-court identification proceeding does not fall within the \u201climited group of questions which survive a plea\u201d (People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993), and thus no issue in this regard has been preserved for our review.\nCardona, P.J., Her cure, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nStein, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered May 23, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn September 2007, defendant allegedly sold cocaine to an undercover police officer and was thereafter arrested and indicted for one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and six counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in varying degrees. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of appeal. Prior to sentencing, defendant submitted a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting that such plea was involuntary and that his counsel was ineffective. County Court denied his motion and\u2014pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement\u2014 sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of seven years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. On this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court abused its discretion in denying his motion without a hearing because his plea was involuntary and that, among other things, he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender.\nWe note, initially, that defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Walker, 47 AD3d 965, 966 [2008]). Nonetheless, we now affirm. \u201cThe decision to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea is a matter within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to its voluntariness\u201d (People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002] [citation omitted]). Moreover, in the absence of some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn (see People v Atkinson, 58 AD3d 943, 943 [2009]).\nHere, the record amply supports County Court\u2019s determination that defendant entered into a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea. Indeed, during his plea colloquy, defendant admitted to facts establishing the elements of his crime and acknowledged that he understood the nature and consequences associated with his guilty plea (see People v White, 52 AD3d 950, 951 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 742 [2008]). Defendant\u2019s subsequent protestation of innocence, furthermore, is insufficient to warrant a hearing on the issue inasmuch as it is unsupported by any evidence and is contradicted by grand jury testimony from both the arresting police officer, who indicated that defendant was in possession of $1,400 worth of cocaine at the time of his apprehension, and the undercover police officer, who stated that she purchased 1.9 grams of cocaine from defendant (see People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d at 665; People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940-941 [1998]).\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender implicates the legality of the sentence imposed and is, thus, similarly not precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Ellis, 53 AD3d 776, 777 [2008]). Nevertheless, his failure to raise the issue before County Court renders the claim unpreserved for our review (see People v Atkinson, 58 AD3d at 944). Were we to consider it, we would find it to be without merit as the record demonstrates substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Paige, 24 AD3d 895, 895 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 851 [2006]).

Following County Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant was sentenced to four years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nPreliminarily, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that County Court erred in summarily denying his motion to withdraw his plea based upon alleged coercion and ineffective assistance of counsel. \u201cGenerally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement\u201d (People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 802 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Carr, 288 AD2d 561 [2001]). To that end, the decision to permit withdrawal of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is a matter committed to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to the plea\u2019s voluntariness (see People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002]; see People v Vinals, 2 AD3d 1210 [2003]). Here, the record is devoid of any indication of fraud or innocence, and defendant\u2019s conclusory allegation of coercion is belied by the transcript of his plea allocution, wherein defendant plainly denied that he had been threatened or otherwise forced to plead guilty (see People v Nichols, 21 AD3d 1273, 1274 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 757 [2005]).\nDefendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is equally unpersuasive. \u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995] [citations omitted]; see People v Vinals, 2 AD3d at 1211). As County Court observed in denying defendant\u2019s motion, the plea negotiations occurred over a lengthy period of time during which various motions were made on defendant\u2019s behalf. Additionally, County Court questioned defendant at length regarding his opportunities to confer with counsel, and defendant unequivocally indicated that he had sufficient time to consult with counsel and was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. Finally, it is apparent from the record that counsel negotiated an advantageous plea to a reduced charge on defendant\u2019s behalf (see People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1066 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]). Under such circumstances, we perceive no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s summary denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (see id. at 1065-1066).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary also is lacking in merit. Even a cursory review of the plea allocution reveals that defendant understood the nature of the charge against him, was apprised of the rights he would be forfeiting by pleading guilty and voluntarily entered into such plea. Notably, \u201c[defendant was not required to recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual exposition, as it was sufficient that he provided unequivocal affirmative responses to the court\u2019s questions, never made statements negating his guilt and indicated that he was entering the plea because he was, in fact, guilty\u201d (People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 972 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCardona, P.J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 12, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nOn June 1, 2000, defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree stemming from her possession of more than one-half ounce of cocaine on February 17, 2000 in Chemung County. Defendant entered a guilty plea to one count on the day her suppression hearing was scheduled. County Court accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment, as well as an unindicted criminal sale. It was further agreed that defendant would be sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 10 years, upon her adjudication as a second felony offender, to run concurrently with a sentence in another county for a violation of probation. During the plea colloquy, defense counsel withdrew defendant\u2019s suppression motion and informed the court that defendant understood that there would be no further hearings. Defendant acknowledged hearing everything and indicated her desire to enter the guilty plea. She did so and was subsequently sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that due to defense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the suppression hearing, she \u201cblindly\u201d entered her guilty plea and, therefore, it was not entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. However, an examination of the record clearly shows that County Court fully explained the consequences of pleading guilty to defendant, including the rights she would be waiving. Defendant indicated that she understood what was transpiring and confirmed that she was not being coerced into entering the plea. Furthermore, she acknowledged that she was doing so based only upon the promises encompassed within the plea bargain. In response to County Court\u2019s inquiry concerning her conduct on the date of the crimes, she responded that she possessed 168 fifty-dollar bags of what she knew or believed to be cocaine, having an aggregate weight of more than one-half ounce. Under the circumstances, we find the failure to hold the suppression hearing \u201chad no impact upon the knowing and voluntary nature of defendant\u2019s plea\u201d (People v Clifford, 295 AD2d 697, 698, lv denied 98 NY2d 709) and conclude that the plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Whitesell, 299 AD2d 654; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813).\nAdditionally, we note that by pleading guilty before she obtained a final order denying her motion to suppress, defendant forfeited her right to appellate review of the sufficiency of the search warrant application under the statutory exception provided in CPL 710.70 (2) (see People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 86-87, lv denied 98 NY2d 642; People v Sides, 242 AD2d 750, 750-751, lv denied 91 NY2d 836).\nNext, defendant argues that her sentence was harsh and excessive and that extraordinary circumstances, consisting of a dysfunctional family environment, alcohol and drug addictions and a history of nonviolent crimes, warrant a reduction of her sentence in the interest of justice. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s sentence was well within the statutory parameters for a class B felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]; \u00a7 220.16 [12]). We note that defendant\u2019s background and family circumstances were contained in the presentence investigation report submitted to County Court (see People v Baker, 253 AD2d 943; People v Kalakowski, 120 AD2d 763, lv denied 68 NY2d 669). We also take into consideration defendant\u2019s failure to effectively deal with her addictions despite the availability of services. Under the circumstances, including defendant\u2019s recidivism, we find that the sentence was not harsh or excessive.\nFinally, while we are not unsympathetic to defendant\u2019s personal circumstances, we do not find them to be \u201cextraordi nary\u201d and, therefore, a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice is not warranted (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]).\nCrew III, Peters, Carpinello and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following her guilty plea. The defendant argued that her plea was not made voluntarily due to her counsel's failure to pursue a suppression hearing, but the Court found that she was adequately informed of the plea's consequences and entered it knowingly. Additionally, the Court ruled that her sentence of 5 to 10 years was not excessive or harsh, given her background and recidivism, and did not warrant reduction in the interest of justice.</s>"}

On this appeal, he argues that the sentence was harsh and excessive and also that the sentence for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree is illegal.\nThe People concede that defendant was not a predicate felon and could not be legally sentenced to more than 8 Vs years as the minimum portion of his indeterminate sentence for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. Therefore, this sentence was illegal (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]).

Further, given defendant\u2019s criminal record and the fact that he pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentences ultimately imposed, all of which were concurrent to each other and to the undischarged portion of the sentence defendant was serving at the time, we find no reason to otherwise disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Trujillo, 175 AD2d 950, lv denied 78 NY2d 1130; People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, lv denied 75 NY2d 812).\nWeiss, P.

He was assigned a Public Defender but later requested a two-week adjournment so that he could retain private counsel. County Court granted the request but, at the next court appearance, defendant appeared with another Public Defender and expressed his desire to continue with assigned counsel. He thereafter entered a counseled Alford plea of guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment. Sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 6 years, defendant appeals.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s sole contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the Public Defenders failed to file certain pretrial motions and were not adequately prepared. Initially, the mere fact that counsel chose not to file the specified motions does not alone mandate the conclusion that counsel was unprepared or ineffective (see, People v Balzer, 155 AD2d 733, 734, lv denied 75 NY2d 810). The record reveals that the Public Defender who represented defendant throughout the majority of the proceedings was fully familiar with the case, filed an omnibus motion requesting discovery and several preliminary hearings, and negotiated a plea bargain that was extremely favorable in light of the severity of the crimes charged, defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his status as a second felony offender (see, People v Brown, 233 AD2d 764, 767, lv denied 89 NY2d 1009; People v Mackey, 175 AD2d 346, 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 969). Further, defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s alleged failures and specifically expressed his satisfaction with the representation he received when he pleaded guilty. Under these circumstances, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941; People v Rafter, 234 AD2d 711, lv denied 89 NY2d 1014; People v St. John, 163 AD2d 687, lv denied 76 NY2d 944).\nCardona, P.

Defendant also waived the right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain and now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in' accepting his plea.\nAccording to defendant, County Court should not have accepted his plea without first making an inquiry concerning the basis of defendant\u2019s request for new assigned counsel. To the extent that defendant\u2019s claim raises an issue regarding the voluntariness of his plea, that issue has not been preserved for our review as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment (see, e.g., People v Ferreri, 271 AD2d 805, lv denied 95 NY2d 834). To the extent that the claim is based upon the constitutional right to counsel of one\u2019s own choosing, and assuming without deciding that such a claim was not encompassed by defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Boyer, 237 AD2d 743, 744, lv denied 90 NY2d 855), the record does not support defendant\u2019s claim.\nDuring plea negotiations on the eve of trial, defendant apparently refused to speak to assigned counsel and made some comments about new counsel. County Court conducted a proceeding on the record to advise defendant that a change in counsel would not delay the trial and that defendant\u2019s options were to accept the plea offer or proceed to trial. During the proceeding, defendant\u2019s only complaint was that \u201cI\u2019ve been incarcerated for eleven months now and I haven\u2019t seen an attorney till yesterday on this case.\u201d Inasmuch as defendant had appeared with assigned counsel for a suppression hearing less than three months earlier, the claim was clearly specious. With regard to new counsel, the court stated: \u201cYou can get a new attorney if the proper [paperwork is] done, but he\u2019s got to be ready to start this trial at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\u201d The court then adjourned the proceeding with instructions to assigned counsel to talk with defendant about the options.\nDefendant thereafter returned for a plea proceeding during which he consulted with assigned counsel several times and entered a knowing and voluntary plea to a reduced charge. He made no request for new counsel and voiced no dissatisfaction with assigned counsel. In these circumstances, the record does not support defendant\u2019s claim of reversible error (see, People v Smith, 231 AD2d 815).\nCardona, P. J., Crew III, Spain and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance, following his guilty plea.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nStein, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered October 6, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nAs the result of an investigation into narcotics trafficking by the Attorney General\u2019s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and 36 codefendants were named in a 278-count sealed indictment which, among other things, charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree and 24 drug felonies. In satisfaction of that indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, defendant, a second felony offender, was offered a sentence of no more than 10 years in prison, upon the condition that, among other things, he \u201ccooperate]\u201d with the prosecution. Prior to sentencing, the People informed County Court that defendant had violated the plea agreement by refusing to speak with the prosecution. Consequently, the court imposed an enhanced sentence of 14 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nInitially, defendant challenges County Court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence, claiming that the nature of defendant\u2019s obligation to cooperate was not sufficiently clarified. Although such argument survives his appeal waiver, inasmuch as defendant did not object to the enhanced sentence on that basis and the record does not indicate that he made an appropriate postal-locution motion, this claim is not preserved for our review (see People v Stanley, 100 AD3d 1152, 1152-1153 [2012]; People v Gabbidon, 96 AD3d 1235, 1236 [2012]). In any event, while the cooperation component of the plea agreement was not described in detail, it clearly obligated defendant to, at the very least, speak to the prosecution, which he flatly refused to do. Inasmuch as defendant violated any reasonable interpretation of the cooperation agreement, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see People v Fleming, 50 AD3d 1390, 1391 [2008]; People v James, 251 AD2d 813, 815 [1998]; compare People v Stanley, 100 AD3d at 1153).\nDefendant\u2019s related claim that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to properly advise him of the full implications of the cooperation agreement deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel\u2014 which also survives the appeal waiver because it implicates the voluntariness of his plea \u2014 is likewise unpreserved (see People v Lohnes, 112 AD3d 1148, 1150 [2013]; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1379-1380 [2013]; People v Youngblood, 107 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1078 [2013]) and does not merit the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction. Moreover, to the extent that it is properly before us, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that his counsel was ineffective by failing to request a hearing on the issue of his compliance with the cooperation agreement.\nFinally, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive. Given defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the plea agreement, coupled with his lengthy criminal record, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Jordan, 111 AD3d 970, 971 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]).\nLahtinen, J.E, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nInasmuch as defendant was not advised of the maximum potential sentence, defendant\u2019s appeal waiver does not foreclose this claim (see People v Edie, 100 AD3d 1262, 1262 [2012]; compare People v Thomas, 81 AD3d 997, 998 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 900 [2011]). [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement that required him to cooperate with the prosecution. The defendant failed to fulfill this obligation, leading to an enhanced sentence of 14 years in prison instead of the initially agreed 10 years. His claims regarding the clarity of the cooperation requirement and ineffective assistance of counsel were deemed unpreserved for review, and the court found no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction of the enhanced sentence.</s>"}

Defendant contends that this sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Our review of the record reveals that at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, she was serving a five-year term of probation arising out of her prior conviction of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In addition, a police search of defendant\u2019s apartment prior to her arrest disclosed over 12 ounces of cocaine, 125 small glass vials, $3,100 in cash and an unlicensed handgun.

As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced to 105 days in jail and five years\u2019 probation. Defendant was released into his own custody pending sentencing. County Court warned him, however, that if he was charged with other crimes before sentencing, he could be sentenced to as much as 5 to 15 years in prison.\nWhile awaiting sentencing, defendant was arrested and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following a hearing at which police officers testified concerning the circumstances of defendant\u2019s arrest, County Court found that enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence on the attempted criminal possession conviction was warranted. County Court then imposed a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the superior court information and was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years to run concurrently with the sentence imposed upon the attempted criminal possession conviction.\nDefendant initially contends that County Court abused its discretion in finding that there was a legitimate basis for his arrest on the criminal sale charge which warranted the enhancement of his sentence on the attempted criminal possession conviction. We disagree. The undercover police officer who alleg edly purchased cocaine from defendant testified that two females led him to defendant after the officer provided them with $20 in marked money to purchase cocaine. The officer stated that when the women found defendant, they huddled with him and then one of them handed the officer what appeared to be cocaine. The officer left the scene and conducted a field test which confirmed that the substance was cocaine. He then radioed other officers who detained defendant and the two women. A search of defendant revealed the $20 in buy money, along with a small amount of marihuana. We conclude that the foregoing provided a legitimate basis for defendant\u2019s arrest on the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712-713 [1993], cert denied 519 US 964 [1996]). Therefore, County Court\u2019s enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence was entirely appropriate.\nFurthermore, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant was fully informed during the plea proceedings that his failure to abide by the no-arrest condition would subject him to a greater sentence. In view of defendant\u2019s disregard of this condition, coupled with the fact that the enhanced sentence was less than the statutory maximum, we find no extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Espino, 288 AD2d 688, 688-689 [2001]).\nCrew III, Peters, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCrew III, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered December 23, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nIn December 1993, defendant was the subject of a six-count indictment, charging him with three counts of assault in the second degree and one count each of the crimes of resisting arrest and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. Prior to sentencing, defendant made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which County Court denied and defendant was sentenced to the previously agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years. Defendant appeals on the ground that his guilty plea was involuntary.\nDefendant argues in essence that the ineffective assistance of counsel rendered by the Public Defenders assigned to his case compelled him to plead guilty, thereby rendering his plea involuntary. It should be noted that while defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude judicial review of the voluntariness of his guilty plea (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10; People v Marziale, 182 AD2d 1035, 1036, lv denied 80 NY2d 835), it does preclude review of his claimed denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel except insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea (see, People v Wood, 207 AD2d 1001; People v Hayes, 194 AD2d 998). To the extent that this issue has been preserved for our review, there is nothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was rendered involuntary by defense counsel\u2019s conduct.\nTo the contrary, the record discloses that defendant made it impossible for the Assistant Public Defender to prepare a defense by reason of defendant\u2019s refusal to communicate with him. When County Court substituted the Public Defender as defense counsel, defendant expressed dissatisfaction with her services as well, electing to plead guilty after a trial date had been set and voir dire was under way. There is no indication that either of the attorneys assigned to defendant\u2019s case would have been other than competent and effective had the case gone to trial. Indeed, the record reflects that the Assistant Public Defender was instrumental in procuring a favorable plea bargain on defendant\u2019s behalf (see, People v Reid, 224 AD2d 728). It is apparent that defendant\u2019s perceived difficulties in preparing a defense were not caused by shortcomings on the part of defense counsel but were instead self-imposed. We conclude that defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary and that County Court correctly exercised its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\nMikoll, J. P., Mercure, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The Court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree after he pleaded guilty.

Consequently, the Court upheld the denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, concluding that the plea was voluntary.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMercure, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered February 22, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nDefendant was indicted for criminal possession of a con trolled substance in the first degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and a number of other counts as the result of an October 8, 1993 incident when cocaine, a scale and a weapon were found in the vehicle in which he was traveling on the Thruway. On October 7, 1994, defendant disposed of the indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The plea was given and accepted as part of a plea bargain that provided for defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal but ensured that his sentence would not exceed a $5,000 fine and a prison term of four years to life so long as he personally appeared for sentencing and committed no additional crimes prior to that time.\nAt a December 28, 1994 appearance in County Court, defendant indicated that he intended to move to withdraw his plea of guilty. Defendant was advised to make the motion in writing, returnable January 10, 1995. As of that date, no motion papers had been filed with County Court. The parties appeared the following day and defendant\u2019s counsel explained that the motion papers had been prepared but defendant was unwilling to sign them because he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea. At the same time, defendant wanted his counsel to pursue what he believed to be a meritorious statutory speedy trial claim. First defendant\u2019s counsel and then County Court advised defendant of the fact that, absent successful withdrawal of his guilty plea, he could not pursue a CPL 30.30 motion. In addition, defendant was advised that if he was successful .in his effort to withdraw his guilty plea but the ensuing CPL 30.30 motion was denied, there could be no assurance that the plea bargain would still be available. Simply stated, it was made patently clear to defendant that he was required to make an election.\nThe parties next appeared in County Court on January 13, 1995 and defendant continued in his effort to pursue the statutory speedy trial issue orally and in the absence of any written motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In the course of his recitation, defendant challenged the ability and honesty of his counsel to the point where the latter sought to be relieved of assignment. County Court granted the motion. Defendant then appeared on February 22, 1995 with new assigned counsel. After asking a number of questions of County Court and the District Attorney concerning the dates of certain prior appearanees and proceedings, defendant indicated that he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea but desired to proceed with sentencing. Sentenced in accordance with his plea bargain, defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw or to vacate his guilty plea precludes appellate review of the contention that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Hayes, 208 AD2d 1054, lv denied 85 NY2d 910; People v Espinal, 176 AD2d 417). In any event, our review of the proceedings in County Court offers no support for defendant\u2019s claims that his lack of education, inability to communicate with his counsel, confusion or any other disability or condition prevented him from knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entering a plea of guilty and waiving his right to appeal. Rather, the record demonstrates an unwavering pattern of duplicity on defendant\u2019s part wherein he doggedly attempts to pursue his CPL 30.30 claim without giving up his advantageous plea bargain. At the time of sentencing, defendant\u2019s tactics escalated into a transparent effort to impair the record with comments such as \"How could I go to trial,\u201d \"I have no choice but to accept,\u201d and \"I cannot go to trial, because the lawyers said they cannot answer the questions that I ask them, because they say they don\u2019t know.\u201d Notwithstanding these and other similar remarks by defendant, we perceive no valid basis for a finding that defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or the waiver of his right to appeal were not properly received or, once given, should have been vacated. Accordingly, the waiver of appeal will be enforced (see, People v Sledge, 195 AD2d 713, lv denied 82 NY2d 903).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and found lacking in merit.\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, White and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree after he pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain.

Following a May 1999 incident in which he violated a protective order, he was charged in a second indictment with two counts of criminal contempt in the first degree. In satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal contempt in the first degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to concurrent prison terms of 4V2 to 9 years on the criminal sale conviction and 2 to 4 years on the contempt conviction. Thereafter, he moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction. County Court denied the motion without a hearing, resulting in these appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Initially, we note that \u201c \u2018[t]he imposition of the sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we should not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d (People v King, 293 AD2d 815, 817-818 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 698 [2002], quoting People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663 [1977]; see People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]). Based upon our review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances. Given defendant\u2019s status as a second felony offender, he was potentially subject to a maximum 12\u00bd to 25-year prison term on the criminal sale conviction (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and a maximum two- to four-year prison term on the criminal contempt conviction (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [e]; [4] [b]). Because each conviction arose out of separate incidents, County Court could also have imposed consecutive prison terms (see People v Smith, 309 AD2d 1081, 1083 [2003]; People v Shook, 294 AD2d 710, 713-714 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 702 [2002]), resulting in a prison term of 14\u00bd to 29 years. In addition, the presentence investigation report reveals that defendant has a lengthy criminal history, including many drug-related crimes.

Defendant rejected a plea agreement offered by the People, pursuant to which he would plead guilty to one charge in the indictment and receive eight years in prison. Defendant did plead guilty as charged, however, with the understanding that he would be sentenced by County Court to a determinate prison term between 5 and 10 years, with the potential that restitution would be awarded. The court thereafter sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, and ordered that defendant pay $370 in restitution.

Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s pro se claims regarding the involuntariness of his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel involve matters outside the record and, thus, are more appropriately raised in a CPL article 440 motion to vacate the judgment (see e.g. People v DeCapria, 121 AD3d 1432, 1433 [2014]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2014]). Defendant failed to preserve his sole remaining argument challenging the amount of restitution because he did not request a hearing or otherwise challenge the award of restitution at sentencing, and corrective action in the interest of justice is unwarranted (see People v Ortolaza, 120 AD3d 843, 844 [2014]; People v White, 119 AD3d 1286, 1287 [2014]).

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal and was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2V2 years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. At defendant\u2019s request, County Court adjourned the date of sentencing to allow defendant time to attend his son\u2019s birthday party.

Defendant failed to appear in court on the sentencing date at 9:30 a.m., but showed up at approximately 1:00 p.m. County Court postponed sentencing to consider whether the sentence should be enhanced, and the matter was adjourned further as a result of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. County Court denied the motion and ultimately sentenced defendant to three years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision.

The court specifically warned him of the consequences of failing to appear, including the potentially longer sentence he faced, and indicated that bad weather or other such issues were not legitimate excuses. Nevertheless, defendant failed to appear at the required time and, when he finally came to court, claimed to have had transportation problems.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nSpain, J.E\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 15, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in return for a negotiated prison sentence of 3V2 years and three years of postrelease supervision. He subsequently was sentenced in County Court to the agreed-upon sentence. No mention was made on the record, at any time prior to or during the plea allocution or at sentencing, of the potential for defendant to be adjudicated a second felony offender or a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1]; \u00a7 70.70 [1] [b]). The following day, and for the first time, the District Attorney filed a predicate felony statement and the court acknowledged that no such statement had been filed prior to defendant\u2019s sentencing. When defendant, who had been returned to court, admitted the predicate felony, the court stated, \u201cI adjudicate the defendant to be a second felony offender.\u201d Defendant was not resentenced or provided with an opportunity to withdraw his plea. He now appeals, contending that his sentence was invalid, his plea was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent and counsel was ineffective for failure to pursue these issues.\nPursuant to CPL 400.21 (2), a predicate statement \u201cmust be filed by the prosecutor before sentence is imposed\u201d (emphasis added), which was not done here. Where the statutory purposes for filing a predicate statement have been satisfied, i.e., \u201capprising the court of the prior conviction and providing defendant with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\u201d (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]), substantial compliance has been found to be adequate (see People v Saddlemire, 50 AD3d 1317 [2008] [the defendant had notice and opportunity to be heard at sentencing regarding predicate, and admitted it]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966 [2008] [the defendant admitted predicate at sentencing]; People v Jones, 47 AD3d 1121 [2008] [the defendant given copy of statement and admitted at sentencing]; People v Ladson, 30 AD3d 836, 837 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 814 [2006] [statement filed before sentencing, the defendant acknowledged predicate but not asked if he wanted to controvert]; People v Valderama, 25 AD3d 819, 820-821 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 854 [2006]; see also People v Ruffin, 42 AD3d 582 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 881 [2007] [defective statement filed, the defendant had notice and opportunity to be heard at sentencing]; People v Johnson, 24 AD3d 967, 969 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 814 [2006]). Here, however, no statement was filed prior to or at sentencing; the record does not reflect that notice was given to defendant prior to sentencing or that defendant had an opportunity to be heard with respect to the prosecutor seeking predicate sentencing (cf. People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d at 1142; People v Saddlemire, supra; People v Ruffin, 42 AD3d at 582).\nFurther, defendant never agreed at the plea allocution to be sentenced as a predicate offender and, hence, cannot be said to have waived his rights under CPL 400.21 when he proceeded to sentencing without objection in the absence of a predicate statement or substantial compliance with the statutory scheme (cf. People v Ross, 7 NY3d 905, 906 [2006] [the defendant agreed at plea to predicate sentencing, so court held that he waived receipt of statement at sentencing and declined to challenge predicate]). Likewise, defendant\u2019s admission to the predicate after sentence was imposed did not validate the sentence or constitute a waiver of the invalid sentence. Thus, there was no compliance with CPL 400.21 and \u201cthe complete failure to file a felony offender statement prior to sentencing renders the sentence invalid as a matter of law\u201d (People v De Fayette, 16 AD3d 708, 710 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005] [no statement ever filed]; see People v Pierre, 8 AD3d 904, 906-907 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]). Accordingly, we must remit to County Court for resentencing pursuant to CPL 400.21.\nTo the extent that defendant contends that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent in view of the failure to include the predicate sentencing status as part of the plea agreement or to mention it at any point prior to sentencing, he did not preserve this claim for appellate review by moving to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 40 AD3d 1276, 1276 [2007]). Given that defendant can raise this issue upon remittal for resentencing, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [3], [b]). Defendant also alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based upon counsel\u2019s failure to advise him regarding the significance of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to file a predicate statement. This too is an issue not preserved for review (see People v McKeney, 45 AD3d 974, 975 [2007]) and, as it concerns matters outside the record, it should more properly be raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see id. at 975).\nLahtinen, Kane, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ, concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Broome County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nThe sentence represents the minimum determinate second felony drug offender sentence for this class B felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i]). [/INST] The court vacated the defendant's sentence for criminal sale of a controlled substance, finding that the prosecution's failure to file a predicate felony statement before sentencing rendered the sentence invalid. The defendant was not given an opportunity to contest the predicate status prior to sentencing, and his subsequent admission to the predicate did not rectify the procedural deficiencies. The case was remitted to the County Court for resentencing, allowing the defendant to raise any further issues related to his plea and the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.</s>"}

Following the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment for the People\u2019s failure to give notice of its motion to amend the indictment to correct a typographical error, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to one year in jail and this appeal ensued.\nWe affirm. Initially, defendant argues that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not informed that the waiver of his right to appeal included a waiver to appeal from County Court\u2019s ruling on the People\u2019s motion to amend the indictment. Given that defendant failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, however, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v Smith, 248 AD2d 891, 892; People v Johnson, 243 AD2d 997, 998, lv denied 91 NY2d 926).

Defendant was also charged along with others in a separate indictment with conspiracy and other crimes stemming from the distribution of cocaine (People v Cancer, 132 AD3d 1021 [2015] [decided herewith]). A joint plea agreement was negotiated to resolve all three matters, which required defendant\u2019s cooperation. Pursuant thereto, defendant entered a guilty plea to attempted grand larceny in the third degree and admitted violating probation. She also pleaded guilty to a count of the indictment that charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (id.). As part of that agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal as to all three matters and signed a written waiver of appeal in open court.\nAt sentencing, County Court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a one-year jail term with credit for time served on the violation petition. With respect to the attempted grand larceny conviction, the court granted defendant a conditional discharge and ordered her to pay certain restitution. At the subsequent sentencing on the drug conviction, the court imposed a one-year jail term thereon, to be served consecutively to the jail term imposed on the violation of probation (id.). Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction for attempted grand larceny in the third degree and the violation of probation.\nOn appeal, defendant\u2019s only argument is that her one-year jail sentence imposed on September 12, 2013 is harsh and excessive, and that this claim is not precluded because her waiver of appeal was invalid. Given that defendant has necessarily completed that one-year jail sentence during the pendency of this appeal, any claims related to sentencing are moot (see People v Rodwell, 122 AD3d 1065, 1068 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1170 [2015]; People v Pozzi, 117 AD3d 1325, 1325 [2014]; People v Trombley, 111 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2013]).\nEgan Jr., Rose and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered February 6, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and conspiracy in the second degree.\nAn indictment charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree (count one), two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (counts two and four), and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (counts three and five) as the result of her participation in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Defendant disposed of the indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, as charged in the first count, and to counts three and five of the indictment, each as reduced to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The guilty pleas were entered with the express understanding, stated upon the record in open court, that defendant would be sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 6 years to life and 5 years to life on the criminal possession counts, and a concurrent term of SVs to 25 years on the conspiracy count. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. The majority of defendant\u2019s arguments are unpreserved for our review by virtue of defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw her guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Mackey, 77 NY2d 846; People v Snow, 253 AD2d 985, lv denied 93 NY2d 858) and are found to lack merit in any event. Notably, a defendant who accepts a plea bargain surrenders the right to make a subsequent challenge to the factual basis for the plea (see, People v Rivera, 266 AD2d 576; People v Morelli, 228 AD2d 818, lv denied 88 NY2d 990) and there was nothing in defendant\u2019s plea allocution that would have given notice of an available agency defense or otherwise cast doubt upon defendant\u2019s guilt or the voluntariness of her plea (see, People v Thompkins, 233 AD2d 759, 760; cf., People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676-677).\nFurther, the record is devoid of evidence supporting defendant\u2019s claims of unreasonable delay in sentencing or denial of effective assistance of counsel. In the latter regard, we note that the test to be applied in the case of a guilty plea, i.e., whether there is an advantageous plea and an absence of record evidence casting doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404), has been satisfied. As a final matter, we are not persuaded to disturb the bargained-for sentence, which was well within the applicable sentencing parameters.\nCrew III, Peters, Spain and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, as part of a plea bargain. The defendant's appeal was largely unpreserved due to the lack of a motion to withdraw her plea, and the court found no merit in her claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel or sentencing delays.

He was sentenced, as agreed, to concurrent seven-year prison terms followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nUpon review of the record, including the plea colloquy and written waiver of appeal, we find that there is an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent, as neither adequately conveyed \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]). Further, although the written waiver bears the same date as the plea proceeding, it was not mentioned during the plea or sentencing proceedings, it was not executed by his counsel, and there was no \u201cattempt by the court to ascertain on the record an acknowledgment from defendant that he had, in fact, signed the waiver or that, if he had, he was aware of its contents\u201d (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 265; cf. People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]).\nAddressing the merits, we are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The plea agreement permitted him to plead guilty to two reduced counts of the four upon which he was indicted, and to obtain concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences of shorter duration than the maximum allowed upon the charges as reduced. The plea agreement did not include a promise by County Court to recommend the Willard Drug Treatment Program; the People opposed such treatment and, ultimately, following review of the presentence investigation, County Court determined that it would not be appropriate (see People v Tollman, 92 AD3d 1082, 1083 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1065 [2013]). As defendant received the promised sentence, and the record fails to establish the presence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of sentencing discretion, we decline to reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]).\nFinally, it is apparent upon review that there is a clerical error in the uniform sentence and commitment form, as it indicates that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] [b]), rather than as a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [ii]), and it must be amended accordingly (see People v Vasavada, 93 AD3d 893, 894 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 978 [2012]; compare People v Whalen, 101 AD3d 1167, 1170 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]).\nPeters, PJ., Rose, Egan Jr. and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed, and matter remitted for entry of an amended uniform sentence and commitment form.

The charge against defendant stemmed from the sale of crack cocaine to a confidential informant in Washington Park in the City of Albany in August 2002. Thereafter, defendant, a second felony offender, was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to, among other things, a term of imprisonment of lxk to 1472 years. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, in light of County Court\u2019s failure to adequately distinguish the right to appeal from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty, defendant\u2019s oral waiver of his right to appeal was invalid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006] ; People v Lewis, 39 AD3d 1025, 1025 [2007]; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 923 [2007] ; People v Cain, 29 AD3d 1157, 1157 [2006]). Accordingly, we will address all issues raised by defendant on appeal, not only those which survive a valid waiver.\nDefendant\u2019s first contention is that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made. Notably, while defendant asserts that this issue was properly preserved for our review by means of a previous motion to vacate the judgment of conviction, the purported motion is not contained in the record nor is any decision from County Court on the matter, thus defeating the purpose of the preservation requirement. In any event, were defendant\u2019s claim properly before us, we would find it lacking in merit. Upon review of the proceedings resulting in the conviction of defendant upon his plea, we find that defendant\u2019s unequivocal affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s factual recitation of his crime to be sufficient and he was adequately apprised of and understood his rights and the ramifications of his plea (see People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007]; People v Lewis, 39 AD3d at 1026; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d at 1076). To the extent that defendant\u2019s claim relates to his counsel\u2019s representation, the grounds advanced largely relate to his sentencing and, consequently, did not impact the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]).\nNext, defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. However, upon review of the record\u2014including his sworn statement during his plea colloquy that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation\u2014we find nothing that casts doubt upon the effectiveness of defendant\u2019s retained counsel (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]). We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s assertion that counsel\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea on the basis of his claims of innocence and an alibi contained in the presentence investigation report rendered her representation less than meaningful, particularly considering defendant\u2019s failure to protest when afforded an opportunity to address County Court prior to pronouncement of his sentence. In sum, we are satisfied that defendant received meaningful representation, especially in light of the favorable plea bargain negotiated by counsel which resulted in defendant pleading to a lower level felony, a negotiated sentence that was less than the maximum permitted and the fact that his plea served to satisfy other uncharged crimes (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024-1025 [2007]; People v Williams, 35 AD3d at 973; People v Cain, 29 AD3d at 1158).\nFinally, we have reviewed defendant\u2019s claim that his bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive and find it to be unavailing (see People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d at 1076; People v Cain, 29 AD3d at 1157-1158).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Rose and Kavanagh, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance following a guilty plea. The court found that the defendant's waiver of his right to appeal was invalid due to inadequate distinction by the County Court, allowing for a review of all appeal issues. The court determined that the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, and the defendant received effective assistance of counsel, despite claims to the contrary, as the negotiated plea resulted in a favorable outcome.</s>"}

He was also sentenced to one-year jail terms upon his plea of guilty to three class A misdemeanor drug charges and a jail term of six months to a class B misdemeanor drug charge. These sentences were to run concurrently with the 5 to 15-year sentences. Defendant now claims that the sentences were harsh and excessive. In rejecting this claim, we note that the class B felony sentences were imposed in accordance with the plea agreement and were well within the statutory parameters. As to the remaining sentences, with the exception of the sentence imposed for the class B misdemeanor crime, we find nothing in the record to warrant disturbing the disposition rendered by County Court. As to the class B misdemeanor crime, the People concede that defendant could not legally be sentenced to more than three months. Therefore, the sentence for this crime should not have been imposed. Because it was concurrent with the other sentences, however, we find no reason to vacate the sentence or remit the matter and instead reduce it to a jail term of three months.\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, White, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nStein, J.\nDefendant was charged in two indictments with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In October 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of both indictments and executed a written waiver of appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court then sentenced defendant to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision and further ordered him to pay $200 in restitution. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s primary contention on this appeal \u2014 which would survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]) \u2014 is that his plea was involuntary based upon the failure of County Court and his trial counsel to advise him. on the record of the immigration consequences of his conviction. It is now established that the failure of counsel to advise a defendant of the possibility of deportation as a result of his or her plea constitutes the ineffective assistance of counsel (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US \u2014, \u2014, 130 S Ct 1473, 1486 [2010]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as defendant limits his argument to the failure of the court and his attorney to advise him on the record of potential immigration consequences, Padilla does not specify that attorneys must do so (id. at 1486). Moreover, while defendant correctly asserts that CPL 220.50 (7) requires the court to advise a defendant on the record, before accepting a plea of guilty, that such plea might result in deportation, the statute explicitly provides that the failure to so advise a defendant does not affect the voluntariness of the plea or the validity of the conviction (see CPL 220.50 [7]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the amount of restitution he was directed to pay also survives even a valid waiver of appeal where, as here, \u201cthe plea agreement did not specify the amount of restitution to be awarded\u201d (People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; see People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]). In the instant matter, defendant agreed to pay restitution at the time of his plea allocution, but did not agree to a specific amount, nor was the method of determining the amount discussed. The presentence investigation report prepared by the Probation Department contains a victim impact statement from the Clinton County District Attorney/Adirondack Drug Task Force seeking recovery of $200 for two controlled buys ($100 each) on the same date. At the sentencing hearing, defendant objected to the $200 total because he had been charged with only one criminal sale of a controlled substance count. He therefore argued that he should only be required to pay restitution of $100.\nDefendant never contested the accuracy of the claimed expenditure of $100 per controlled buy and never requested that County Court conduct a hearing, despite being advised by the court that he was entitled to such a hearing. Inasmuch as the only issue raised by defendant regarding restitution was a purely legal one, a hearing was not required (compare People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 145-146 [1996]; People v Stevens, 80 AD3d 791, 792-793 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 900 [2011]). Similarly, because defendant never challenged the accuracy of the restitution amount sought, we reject his contention \u2014 raised for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the law enforcement agency\u2019s failure to submit an affidavit supporting its restitution request pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9) requires that the award be vacated (see People v Perez, 203 AD2d 665, 667 [1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 970 [1994]). Under these circumstances, we discern no abuse of County Court\u2019s discretion in ordering restitution without a hearing (see generally People v Periard, 15 AD3d 693, 694 [2005]).\nAs to the merits of the award, a trial court \u201cmay require restitution or reparation as part of the sentence imposed upon a person convicted of an offense\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [1]). An offense is defined as including \u201cthe offense for which a defendant was convicted, as well as any other offense that is part of the same criminal transaction or that is contained in any other accusatory instrument disposed of by any plea of guilty by the defendant to an offense\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [4] [a]). Specifically, a defendant convicted of a \u201cfelony involving the sale of a controlled substance\u201d may be ordered to repay a law enforcement agency \u201cthe amount of funds expended in the actual purchase\u201d of a controlled substance (Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [9]). Here, even though defendant was charged with only one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance, the two controlled buys in question were part of the same criminal transaction and were related to the possession charges in the indictment. Thus, County Court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution for the buy money used in both controlled buys (see People v Perez, 203 AD2d at 667). On the other hand, County Court may not impose a surcharge when restitution is to be paid to a law enforcement agency (see Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [9]). Thus, the 10% surcharge imposed here must be vacated (see People v Williams, 272 AD2d 990 [2000]; People v Perez, 203 AD2d at 667).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be without merit.\nPeters, J.E, Spain, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating so much thereof as directed defendant to pay a 10% surcharge on the restitution to the Clinton County District Attorney/Adirondack Drug Task Force, and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] The defendant, charged with multiple counts of criminal possession and sale of a controlled substance, pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to three years in prison, along with restitution. He appealed, arguing that his plea was involuntary due to a lack of advisement regarding immigration consequences and contested the restitution amount, which he believed should be lower. The court found no abuse of discretion regarding the restitution order but vacated a 10% surcharge on that restitution, affirming the remainder of the judgment.</s>"}

Contrary to his assertion here, our review of the record reveals that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Kennedy, 46 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 841 [2008]). Indeed, County Court\u2019s remarks regarding a theoretical motion to withdraw the plea were made while ensuring that defendant fully understood the ramifications of pleading guilty and followed a detailed colloquy during which defendant informed County Court that he had discussed the matter with his attorney, was not impaired and had not been coerced into entering the plea (see People v Rock, 56 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 787 [2009]; People v Washington, 51 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2008]).

The defendant claimed that his former attorney had not told him that he had to give up his right of appeal. The defendant did not request restoration to his pre-plea status; instead, he applied to the County Court for what would have amounted to permission to appeal notwithstanding his prior waiver.\nWe conclude that the court did not err in denying what was, in effect, an application by the defendant for leave to withdraw the waiver of his right to appeal. The record of the plea proceeding establishes that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; see also, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911).

We disagree.\nIt is well settled that \"[a] court has the inherent power to correct its own error in accepting a plea or imposing sentence when the error is clear from the face of the record as it is here\u201d (Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, 175 AD2d 163, 164; People v Wright, 56 NY2d 613; People v Minaya, 54 NY2d 360, cert denied 455 US 1024; see also, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445; Matter of Campbell v Pesce, 60 NY2d 165). Here, the court\u2019s ameliorative action \u2014 to which defense counsel consented \u2014 was ministerial in nature and fully comported with the expectations of the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant at the time the plea was originally entered and sentence imposed (see, Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra; People v Wright, supra; see also, Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, supra). The cases on which the defendant relies are distinguishable (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, supra; Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra). In both Kisloff and Campbell the Trial Justice sought to vacate previously entered pleas to misdemeanors and then attempted to either reinstate the original felony indictment counts (Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra), or proposed that the defendant enter a new plea to a more serious crime (Matter of Kisloff v Covington, supra; see, People v Calderon, 79 NY2d 61; see also, People v Moquin, 77 NY2d 449). Here, in contrast, the court\u2019s unobjected-to remedial action resulted in an amended plea to a less serious crime and the imposition of the same, minimum permissible prison term to which the defendant had voluntarily and knowingly agreed as part of her plea agreement (cf., Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, supra). In light of the foregoing, the defendant is not entitled to the vacatur of the amended plea.\nWe have reviewed the defendant\u2019s remaining contention and find it to be without merit. Mangano, P. J., Thompson, Bracken and Pizzuto, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant's appeal from an amended judgment convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, following a guilty plea, was affirmed. The court corrected an initial error regarding the classification of the felony, allowing the defendant to plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive a minimum permissible sentence of three years to life imprisonment, which was consistent with the original plea agreement. The court found that it had the inherent authority to make this correction, and the defendant's arguments against it were deemed without merit.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nYesawich, Jr., J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Crew, III, J.), rendered November 7, 1986 in Tioga County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nDefendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony; he allegedly sold 0.75 grams of cocaine to a police informant. During his trial on that charge, defendant, on the advice of counsel, pleaded guilty to a class D felony and received a bargained-for sentence of 2 to 4 years\u2019 incarceration. Following his plea, defendant, pursuant to CPL 400.21, challenged the validity of his prior felony conviction in Pennsylvania, claiming that he thought he was pleading guilty to a misdemeanor or had the opportunity to convert the felony to a misdemeanor by testifying on behalf of the prosecution. Supreme Court held a hearing and determined that defendant was well aware he was pleading guilty to a felony. At sentencing, defendant complained about the effectiveness of his trial counsel. He was given the opportunity to consult with a different lawyer, following which he declined to withdraw his guilty plea. The agreed-upon sentence was then imposed. Defendant appeals, relying primarily on the grounds raised at Supreme Court. We affirm.\nA knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea generally waives nonjurisdictional defenses (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5), such as a claim of ineffective trial counsel (see, People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535). Defendant seeks to bootstrap that claim by arguing that he was \"railroaded\u201d into pleading guilty because of his attorney\u2019s poor trial performance and, therefore, his plea was involuntary. The record reveals that the motivating factor for his plea was the strength of the People\u2019s case, not any inadequacy on the part of defense counsel (see, People v Bonk, 83 AD2d 695). His belief that a promising defense existed is not supported by the record. That defendant\u2019s counsel was indeed effective is apparent from the fact that although defendant faced a possible prison term of 12V2 to 25 years if convicted of the indicted charge, counsel secured a plea to a less severe felony and the minimum sentence available.\nGiven defendant\u2019s acknowledgement during the Pennsylvania plea allocution that the offenses to which he was pleading guilty were all felonies, his challenge to his status as a predicate felon lacks merit. And defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including the assertion that the negotiated sentence was harsh and excessive, are either unpersuasive or have been waived by his guilty plea (see, e.g., People v Clavijo, 126 AD2d 907, 908; People v Normandin, 122 AD2d 348, 349-350).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Weiss and Yesawich, Jr., JJ., concur. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty to a lesser felony charge, despite his claims of ineffective counsel and being misled about his plea.

The defendant's challenges regarding his prior felony status and the severity of his sentence were deemed unpersuasive or waived by his guilty plea.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nWeiss, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered May 28, 1985, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nOn September 7, 1984, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based on his sale of cocaine to an undercover City of Albany police officer on October 26, 1983. On April 22, 1985, the morning of the scheduled trial, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. No promises as to sentencing were made except for County Court\u2019s agreement not to sentence defendant as a persistent felon. At sentencing, defendant requested leave to withdraw his plea, contending that the late disclosure of a tape recording between defendant and an undercover police officer, coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s ostensible misrepresentation of the sentence during plea negotiations, deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel and coerced his plea. The prosecutor responded that the tape recording was to be used only to rebut the agency defense, if needed, and that the plea bargain proposed on April 19, 1985, which included a sentence of 3 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment, was made subject to the court\u2019s approval. Defense counsel acknowledged that he misunderstood this qualification of the proposed plea. County Court denied the application and sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of IVi to 15 years. This appeal ensued.\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that he was deprived of an opportunity for a fair trial by the People\u2019s failure to timely disclose the tape recording was effectively waived by his plea of guilty (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, cert denied 475 US 1150; People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1). In any event, since defendant concededly had an opportunity to hear the tape in its entirety prior to pleading guilty, no prejudice has been demonstrated.\nWe further find no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s refusal to vacate the plea. This is not an instance where the plea was induced by a sentencing promise which the court was subsequently unwilling or unable to fulfill (see, e.g., People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). Any misunderstanding as to the sentence to be received was clarified by the court prior to the entry of defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, when the purported prison term of 3 to 6 years was rejected. Moreover, a review of the plea allocution confirms that defendant was thoroughly apprised of the consequence of his plea, that he acknowledged that he had been given a full opportunity to discuss the matter with his attorney, that the plea was of his own free will and that he was pleading guilty to avoid a potential persistent felony offender sentence. Accordingly, County Court could readily determine that defendant\u2019s plea was not coerced and thus refuse his request for withdrawal (see, People v Austin, 117 AD2d 835; People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677; People v Cooke, 61 AD2d 1060).\nNor can we agree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the confusion attendant the plea negotiations deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. Not only is this contention belied by the plea minutes, but the record confirms that meaningful representation was provided (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137). Once retained, counsel made appropriate motions for disclosure of the tape and, since defendant faced a potential persistent felony offender sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.10 [2]), he also secured a favorable plea bargain (see, People v Kelsch, supra, at 678). By defendant\u2019s own account, counsel ceased trial preparation in reliance on the proposed plea bargain just two days before the scheduled trial date. Given this time frame, the fact that counsel again heard the tape recording on the morning of the trial and the voluntary nature of the plea, we perceive no undue prejudice to defendant.\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that the second felony offender statute (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06) is unconstitutional, in that the 10-year qualifying period is measured from the date of the sentencing to the commission of the offense under review, is without merit (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]; People v McGill, 132 AD2d 846). Finally, County Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the terms of the plea bargain and the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] M).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Main, Casey, Weiss and Mikoll, JJ., concur. [/INST] The County Court of Albany County affirmed the conviction of the defendant, who pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance after being charged with selling cocaine to an undercover officer. The defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea was denied, as he had been adequately informed of the plea's consequences and had not demonstrated coercion or ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also rejected claims regarding the constitutionality of the second felony offender statute and upheld the imposed sentence as appropriate within statutory guidelines.</s>"}

In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to 4V2 years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision.

Nevertheless, his arguments provide no basis for reversal.\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that his plea was involuntarily entered is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to advance, in a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, the particular arguments now made before us (see People v Perry, 50 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 963 [2008]).

Defendant\u2019s allegation that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is also unavailing.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County rendered June 16, 1972, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the fourth degree and two counts of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree. The indictment arose out of two alleged sales of LSD by defendant to a State Police informer. The jury found defendant guilty of all four counts and the trial court sentenced him to a term of not more than four years imprisonment on each count, the terms to run concurrently. Defendant contends .(1) that he was denied a speedy trial; (2) that the lower court erred in refusing to admit the testimony of two defense witnesses; (3) that the sentence was harsh and excessive; and (4) that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. When the case came on for trial on January 13, 1972, the District Attorney moved for an adjournment on the ground that a preceding trial had lasted until approximately 1:30 a.m. of that morning and, as a result, he had been unable to have his witnesses ready for trial that day. The court adjourned the ease for a period of four days. We find that the defendant was not prejudiced by this short delay. Nor do we find merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the testimony of two defense witnesses which he purportedly offered to show bias and hostility on the part of. the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, the informant. The testimony offered, however, could not on any view be regarded as demonstrative of the witness\u2019 bias towards defendant, but rather merely tended to show prior immoral or criminal acts of the witness. Unlike hostility or bias, which <(is not a collateral inquiry, but may be proved by others than the witness himself\u201d (People V. Glermon, 175 N. Y. 45, 52), testimony as to prior immoral or criminal acts relates to collateral matter. Therefore, although the witness may be cross-examined, the cross-examiner may not (except as to a criminal conviction) call other witnesses or produce other evidence to refute him (People v. Zabrocky, 26 N Y 2d 530, 535; Richardson, Evidence [9th ed.], \u00a7 503). Thus, the proffered testimony was properly excluded. We find that the sentence imposed is not \u2022excessive. Having been convicted of four felonies involving the sale and possession of drugs, including two class D felony counts, defendant could have received a far greater sentence. Thus, a maximum sentence of four years is by no means harsh or excessive. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s final contention that the record is insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The verdict is amply supported by the record. We have examined the remainder of defendant\u2019s contentions and find them to be without merit. Judgment affirmed. Staley, Jr., J. P., Greenblott, Sweeney, Kane and Reynolds, concur. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Chemung County upheld the conviction of the defendant for two counts of criminally selling and two counts of criminal possession of a dangerous drug.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMikoll, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Friedlander, J.), rendered June 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.\nDefendant contends on appeal that County Court erred in denying his request for adjudication as a youthful offender. Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, a class D violent felony, in satisfaction of a multicount indictment involving the possession of loaded firearms.\nThe youthful offender statute, CPL 720.20, excepts from the definition of \"eligible youth\u201d a person convicted of an \"armed felony\u201d, which includes possession of a deadly weapon (see, CPL 1.20 [41]). A deadly weapon is a loaded weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury, may be discharged (Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 [4]). Having pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, defendant was not an \"eligible youth\u201d. Notwithstanding his plea to an armed felony, youthful offender status could be accorded if County Court found mitigating circumstances (see, CPL 720.10 [3]).\nDefendant urges that it is unclear as to whether County Court denied youthful offender treatment due to defendant\u2019s ineligibility or as a matter of sentencing discretion. This issue was not preserved for appellate review. Defendant failed to object to the court\u2019s sentencing procedure and never moved for reconsideration or clarification of the youthful offender determination under CPL 220.60 (3) or 440.10. We therefore decline to consider the question.\nIn any event, denial of the youthful offender treatment was an appropriate exercise of County Court\u2019s discretion. It was disclosed to the court by way of defendant\u2019s statement that his possession of the .38 caliber handgun was to protect a drug enterprise in which he was actively involved. Also, in considering the circumstances attendant on the commission of the crime, Grand Jury minutes were presented to the court by the District Attorney as part of the sentencing procedure. We find defendant\u2019s objection to their use for this purpose without merit. A sentencing court may consider any relevant information, subject only to the due process requirement that the information is \"reliable and accurate\u201d (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712). Considering the information supplied bearing on the manner in which the crime was committed and defendant\u2019s past criminal activity, the court properly found that no mitigating circumstances exist warranting youthful offender treatment (see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 334, affd 67 NY2d 625).\nCardona, P. J., Crew III, White and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The County Court of Tompkins County convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and denied his request for youthful offender status, which he appealed. The court found that the defendant was ineligible for such status due to his conviction for an armed felony and did not find any mitigating circumstances warranting a deviation from this rule. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, noting that the County Court appropriately exercised its discretion based on the circumstances of the crime and the defendant's involvement in criminal activity.</s>"}

On about ten separate occa sions defendant had appeared with counsel at a calendar part of Criminal Term before the case was assigned for trial before respondent on July 29, 1992. On that date defendant offered, through counsel, to plead guilty to an attempted sale in the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictment,, in return for a promised sentence of five years probation. Throughout an intensive colloquy, defendant refused to admit his guilt of the offense charged, insisting on his right to enter what amounted to an Alford plea (North Carolina v Alford, 400 US 25), whereby a defendant may be permitted to deny guilt but nonetheless plead guilty to avoid the risks perceived in going to trial. On behalf of the People, the Assistant District Attorney then withdrew her consent to the proposed plea bargain without an admission of guilt, and announced the People\u2019s readiness for trial. Despite the absence of prosecutorial consent, and even explicit objection, respondent accepted the plea and set a sentencing date. The People now seek relief in this Court.\nWhen the People do not consent, a court is without power or jurisdiction to accept a defendant\u2019s plea to less than the full indictment (People ex rel. Leventhal v Warden, 102 AD2d 317; see, CPL 220.10 [3]). And where, as here, a court acts beyond its jurisdiction, prohibition will lie to redress this type of error (Matter of Cosgrove v La Mendola, 73 AD2d 810).\nMatter of Gribetz v Edelstein (66 AD2d 788) is illustrative. In that case a defendant wished to plead to the charge of burglary in the third degree, and his co-defendant refused. The People took the position that unless both pleaded, the offer would be withdrawn and consent withheld. Despite this, the court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea. In granting prohibition and vacating the plea, the Second Department noted: \"A District Attorney may dictate the terms under which he will agree to consent to accept a guilty plea and where his terms are not met, he may withhold such consent; the withholding of such consent by statutory mandate renders the court without authority to accept a plea to anything less than the entire indictment [citations omitted].\u201d (Supra.)\nHere, the People had the power and right to \"dictate\u201d the terms and conditions of the plea, and one of those conditions, advanced early in the plea negotiations, was an allocution containing an admission of guilt. Criminal Term had no power to sweep that condition aside. Concur\u2014Sullivan, J. P., Milonas, Wallach, Ross and Asch, JJ. [/INST] The court grants a petition for prohibition, vacating the guilty plea accepted on August 10, 1992, in the case of People v. Nathaniel Johnson, due to the lack of prosecutorial consent for a plea deal that did not involve an admission of guilt. The court emphasizes that, without the District Attorney's agreement, it lacked jurisdiction to accept a plea to a lesser charge, and thus the indictment is remanded for further proceedings.</s>"}

County Court explained that this right was separate from the other rights that defendant was forfeiting by pleading guilty and defendant communicated his understanding. He then proceeded to execute a detailed written waiver in open court after reviewing it with counsel. Thus, defendant is foreclosed by his valid waiver from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Miller, 137 AD3d 1485, 1485 [2016]; People v Rushlow, 137 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2016]).\nDefendant also challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Although it is not precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal, this claim has not been preserved for our review, as the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Blair, 136 AD3d 1105, 1106 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1066 [2016]; People v Walker, 135 AD3d 1244, 1244-1245 [2016]). Notably, defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt and thus trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Walker, 135 AD3d at 1245). Further, defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, although it also survives his appeal waiver, likewise has not been preserved for our review, for the reason noted above (see People v Hughes, 134 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 966 [2016]; People v Bethea, 133 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 992 [2016]).\nEgan Jr., Devine, Mulvey and Aarons, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCrew III, J.\nOn July 24, 1994 defendant, following his arraignment on a felony complaint accusing him of, inter alia, three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was committed to the custody of the Sheriff in lieu of $500,000 bail. Thereafter, defendant and 11 others were indicted and charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree. Additionally, defendant was charged in 32 counts of that indictment with, inter alia, 26 counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Upon defendant\u2019s arraignment on the indictment, defense counsel advised County Court that defendant, defense counsel and the District Attorney had signed a proffer agreement wherein the District Attorney consented to a reduction of bail to $75,000 in exchange for defendant\u2019s cooperation in connection with the investigation leading to the instant indictment and any related investigations and, additionally, at the appropriate time, the District Attorney would give defendant consideration concerning disposition of the charges against him by reason of such cooperation.\nFollowing the aforesaid arraignment, counsel for defendant apparently inquired of the District Attorney what his position would be regarding a plea and sentence in the event that defendant cooperated with the authorities, and counsel was advised that defendant would be permitted to plead to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with an indeterminate prison sentence of 8 to 24 years. Counsel for defendant found this position to be particularly harsh and the District Attorney, after further consideration, indicated a willingness to recommend a sentence of 7 to 21 years. Continu ing to find the District Attorney\u2019s plea offer as unreasonable, defense counsel moved for specific performance of the \"cooperation and plea agreement\u201d, which motion was denied. Following defendant\u2019s plea to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and his sentence thereon of 8 to 24 years, this appeal ensued.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, there was never placed upon the record a plea agreement susceptible of specific performance (see, Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116). Defendant agreed to cooperate with the authorities in consideration of bail reduction, and the District Attorney acknowledged that he would consider such cooperation in determining his recommended disposition of the charges. The fact that defendant and his attorney did not perceive that the District Attorney gave sufficient consideration to defendant\u2019s cooperation is of no moment, inasmuch as the District Attorney never committed to any specific and, therefore, enforceable plea agreement.\nMikoll, J. P., Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\n. There appears to be no serious dispute that defendant did, in fact, cooperate with law enforcement officials.\n. Defendant, in fact, received a bail reduction in consideration of his agreement to cooperate and it is clear that the District Attorney was not unmindful of defendant\u2019s cooperation, having permitted him to plead to one count in satisfaction of a 32-count indictment, thus enabling defendant to avoid the risk of consecutive sentences. [/INST] On July 24, 1994, the defendant was arraigned on felony charges and initially held on $500,000 bail, which was later reduced to $75,000 in exchange for his cooperation with authorities regarding a related investigation. Although the defendant's counsel sought a specific plea agreement due to dissatisfaction with the District Attorney's proposed sentence, the court affirmed that no enforceable plea agreement existed, as the District Attorney had only indicated a consideration of the defendant's cooperation without committing to specific terms. Ultimately, the defendant pled guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance and received a sentence of 8 to 24 years, which was deemed appropriate given the circumstances.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nPeters, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered May 6, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with that agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals, challenging the sufficiency of his plea allocution, the voluntariness of his plea and the effectiveness of his counsel.\nDefendant contends that his plea allocution was insufficient because he never recited the actions taken by him to establish the elements of the crime. Where, as here, there is an enforceable appeal waiver, operating in conjunction with a failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, our review is precluded (see People v Simmons, 24 AD3d 1018, 1019 [2005]; People v Briggs, 21 AD3d 652, 653 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 881 [2005]; People v Stubblefield, 18 AD3d 955, 955 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 795 [2005]). Moreover, if we consider defendant\u2019s assertions, we would find them without merit. County Court\u2019s questioning during the final plea allocution served to establish each element of the crime; none of defendant\u2019s statements negated any essential element or cast doubt upon his guilt. For these reasons, the narrow exception to the preservation rule would not be applicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]).\nAs to the voluntariness of his plea, defendant also contends that the trial judge was biased since such judge recently presided over a Family Court matter where defendant was a party. However, he failed to make a motion for the judge\u2019s recusal or otherwise raise the issue before County Court. Even though the claim is unpreserved for our review (see People v Rizzo, 5 AD3d 924, 925 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 646 [2004]; People v Lebron, 305 AD2d 799, 800 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 583 [2003]; People v Maxam, 301 AD2d 791, 793 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 617 [2003]), we note that \u201c[a]bsent a legal disqualification under Judiciary Law \u00a7 14, a [t]rial |j]udge is the sole arbiter of recusal . . . [and a] court\u2019s decision in this respect may not be overturned, unless it was an abuse of discretion\u201d (People v Moreno, 70 NY2d 403, 405-406 [1987]; see People v Smith, 272 AD2d 679, 681 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 938 [2000]). As the record reveals no abuse of discretion and further indicates that defendant fully discussed the plea agreement with his attorney before accepting it, the claim is meritless.\nTo the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacted his voluntary, intelligent, and knowing decision to accept the plea, it survives his waiver of appeal. Yet, without a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment, it is unpreserved; nothing in the record warrants an exception to the preservation doctrine (see People v Clifford, 295 AD2d 697, 698 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 709 [2002]). Were we to reach the issue in the interest of justice, we would find no merit (see People v Russo, 8 AD3d 903, 904 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 681 [2004]). \u201cSo long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u201d (People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; see People v Henry, 95 NY2d 563, 565 [2000]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]), a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel will have been met. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, his initial arraignment fully complied with CPL 210.15 (2); he was made aware of all of his pertinent rights, a plea of not guilty was entered on his behalf and the matter was adjourned for him to obtain counsel. Moreover, the record reflects that defendant discussed an agency defense with his counsel prior to the plea and the plea that counsel ultimately negotiated exposed defendant to a sentence which was substantially reduced from its maximum potential (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Accordingly, with the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requiring proof of less then meaningful representation, a mere disagreement with the strategy and tactics employed by counsel will not suffice (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 708 [1988]).\nFinally, we find no abuse of discretion or any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant our modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Dedmon, 10 AD3d 738, 739 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 756 [2004]; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 872 [1999]).\nMercure, J.P., Crew III, Mugglin and Kane, JJ., concur.

County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to concurrent prison terms of 2V2 years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, ordered restitution and imposed a $1,000 fine for each offense.

As such, we find that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Santana, 95 AD3d 1503, 1503 [2012]). Furthermore, as the record reflects that defendant was informed during the plea colloquy that a fine up to $5,000 could be imposed as part of the sentence, the valid appeal waiver precludes defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the fine imposed (see People v Campo, 125 AD3d 1058, 1059 [2015]; People v Oginski, 123 AD3d 1303, 1303 [2014]; see also People v Anderson, 99 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1009 [2013]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Upon his conviction after trial, he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum term of four years and a maximum term of his natural life (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subds 2, 3).

Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon sentence of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that his plea was not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered due to mental incompetency survives his waiver of the right to appeal but is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Coons, 73 AD3d 1343, 1344 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 803 [2010]; People v Dantzler, 63 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 799 [2010]).

In any event, the record does not reflect that defendant lacked the capacity to enter a voluntary, knowing and intelligent plea. Although defendant informed County Court that he had previously suffered a brain injury in a motor vehicle accident, the court confirmed that defendant understood the proceedings and was able to clearly communicate with counsel, and he affirmed that there was nothing mentally or physically compromising his ability to enter a knowing plea. Accordingly, we would also conclude that County Court did not abuse its discretion by accepting defendant\u2019s plea without holding a CPL article 730 competency hearing (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to request a CPL article 730 competency hearing, although not precluded by his appeal waiver as it relates to the voluntariness of his plea, is similarly unpreserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2010]; People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 853 [2009]).

Bennet (39 A D 2d 320, 326), in which we said \u201c when HACC is forced by financial pressures to refrain from carrying out the manifest and salutary intent of the statute, the statute must be construed to authorize the court to apply any of the sentencing options which are appropriate under the circumstances to the convicted addict.\u201d In our opinion the language employed by the sentencing court, at bar, was equivocal on the question of its awareness of the options open for the sentence of a defendant who is a narcotic addict, not receivable by the NACC. In remanding we do not, of course, indicate what sentences should be imposed. Latham, Acting P. J., Shapiro, Gulotta, Christ and Brennan, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of multiple counts of criminally selling a dangerous drug, receiving concurrent sentences of up to seven years and five years for separate indictments. The appellate court reversed the sentences and remanded the cases for resentencing, citing the sentencing court's unclear understanding of its options for a defendant identified as a narcotic addict, especially in light of financial limitations affecting the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMercure, J.\nAppeals (1) from an order of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), dated January 22, 2008, which denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her plea of guilty, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered February 11, 2008, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of a superior court information charging her with two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree. As a condition of the plea, defendant waived her right to appeal. At sentencing, she personally requested that County Court permit her to withdraw her plea of guilty, asserting that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court then assigned new counsel and adjourned sentencing to allow defendant to prepare a formal motion to withdraw, which she thereafter filed. The court denied the motion and sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a three-year term of probation and imposed a fine. The court also issued an order of protection prohibiting defendant from having any unsupervised contact with children under the age of 18 not related to her within six degrees of consanguinity. Defendant appeals from both the order denying her motion to withdraw her plea of guilty and the judgment of conviction.\nInitially, we note that \u201c[a]ppeals in criminal cases are strictly limited to those authorized by statute\u201d (People v Bautista, 7 NY3d 838, 838-839 [2006]; see People v Whalen, 49 AD3d 916, 916 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 940 [2008]). Inasmuch as an order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea does not fall within the provisions of CPL article 450, defendant\u2019s appeal from the order denying her motion must be dismissed (see People v Riley, 25 AD2d 915, 916 [1966]). We note, however, that the merits of defendant\u2019s challenges to the denial of her motion are nevertheless reviewable upon her appeal from the judgment of conviction (see CPL 470.15 [1]).\nTurning to the merits, defendant\u2019s challenges to the voluntariness of her plea survive her waiver of the right to appeal and were preserved for our review by her motion to withdraw the plea (see e.g. People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896 [2008]). That said, \u201c [withdrawal of a plea will not be permitted in the absence of \u2018some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement\u2019 \u201d (People v Graham-Harrison, 272 AD2d 780, 781 [2000] [citation omitted]; see People v Griffin, 4 AD3d 674, 675 [2004]).\nHere, defendant asserts that she should have been permitted to withdraw her plea because she mistakenly believed that she was pleading guilty to two class B misdemeanor charges of crim-\ninal sale of marihuana in the fifth degree. This argument is belied by the lengthy plea allocution, which reveals that County Court consistently informed defendant that she was pleading to criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree and expressly distinguished the crime from that defined in Penal Law \u00a7 221.35, i.e., criminal sale of marihuana in the fifth degree. While notations in the court clerk\u2019s minutes of the plea proceeding mislabeled the crime as a class B misdemeanor, those notations are not consistent with the transcript of the plea allocution itself. In any event, the intended disposition of three years of probation\u2014to which defendant agreed\u2014is not a permissible sentence for a class B misdemeanor conviction (see Penal Law \u00a7 65.00 [3]; People v Neal, 41 AD3d 971, 972 [2007]). Furthermore, defendant did not support her claim of mistake with any evidence beyond the clerk\u2019s minutes and transcript of the plea allocution\u2014she did not, for example, submit a sworn statement on her own behalf or from her former defense counsel in connection with the motion to withdraw (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]; People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1065-1066 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]). Finally, we note that the order of protection was not part of the sentence imposed and, thus, County Court\u2019s issuance of that order does not entitle defendant to withdraw her plea (see People v Hull, 52 AD3d 962, 963-964 [2008]; People v Dixon, 16 AD3d 517, 517 [2005]; see also People v Nieves, 2 NY3d 310, 316 [2004]). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her plea.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments are barred by her waiver of the right to appeal.\nCardona, P.J., Rose, Malone Jr. and Kavanagh, JJ., concur. Ordered that the appeal from the order dated January 22, 2008 is dismissed. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court upheld the denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw her guilty plea to two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, affirming her conviction. The defendant's claim that she mistakenly believed she was pleading to lesser charges was found to be unsupported by evidence, as the court's records clearly indicated the nature of the charges. Consequently, the court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion and dismissed the appeal related to the motion while affirming the judgment of conviction.</s>"}

Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that he did not knowingly waive the right to appeal. Defendant was advised that the appeal waiver was part of the plea agreement and he executed a written waiver in open court after discussing the appeal waiver with counsel. Although County Court made a minimal inquiry, the record reveals that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal was a knowing and voluntary choice (see People v Binns, 82 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2011]; People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010]). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed; it is also unpreserved, as there is no indication on this record that he moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Taylor, 89 AD3d 1143, 1143 [2011]). The exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable, as defendant made no statements during the allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt (see People v McFarren, 83 AD3d 1209, 1209-1210 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 860 [2011]).\nTo the extent that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relates to the voluntariness of the plea and, therefore, survives his appeal waiver, it is similarly unpreserved for our review given defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Tatum, 82 AD3d 1411, 1411 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]; People v Ivey, 79 AD3d 1531, 1532 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 859 [2011]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice is barred by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Ivey, 79 AD3d at 1532; People v Fields, 41 AD3d 1089 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 961 [2007]).\nPeters, P.J., Lahtinen, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur.

Additionally, the court found that the defendant's argument for a reduction of his sentence was barred by the valid appeal waiver.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nLahtinen, J.P.\nAppeal from an order of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), entered August 28, 2014, which denied defendant\u2019s motion for resentencing pursuant to CPL 440.46.\nIn 2001, defendant was convicted of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender to four prison terms of 12V2 to 25 years on the criminal sale and third-degree criminal possession convictions and a prison term of 7V2 to 15 years on the fourth-degree criminal possession conviction, all sentences to run concurrently. His conviction was later affirmed on appeal (People v Lee, 303 AD2d 839 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 622 [2003]).\nIn 2009, defendant made a pro se motion pursuant to CPL 440.46 to be resentenced on these crimes. County Court denied the motion on the ground that a prior violent felony conviction rendered him ineligible for resentencing. This Court reversed and remitted the matter to County Court to reconsider defendant\u2019s motion in light of the relevant factors (People v Lee, 110 AD3d 1346 [2013]). On remittal, County Court again denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding that he was not entitled to resentencing on the fourth-degree criminal possession conviction, a class C felony, because the provisions of CPL 440.46 applied only to class B felonies. Nevertheless, the court proceeded to review defendant\u2019s criminal history, the circumstances underlying his conviction, his prison disciplinary record and his accomplishments while in prison, and concluded that substantial justice would not be served by resentencing him. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, the People concede, and we agree, that County Court erred in finding that defendant was ineligible to be resentenced on the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree because it is a class C felony. The statute clearly provides for resentencing on a class C felony where, as here, the original sentence was imposed at the same time as the sentences on the class B felonies (see CPL 440.46 [2]). Accordingly, defendant was eligible to be resentenced on this crime.\nNotwithstanding this error, County Court proceeded to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s motion. Under CPL 440.46, an eligible defendant shall be resentenced \u201cunless \u2018substantial justice dictates that the application should be denied\u2019 \u201d (People v Davis, 128 AD3d 1269, 1269 [2015], quoting L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 23; see People v Carpenter, 86 AD3d 721, 721 [2011]). Here, County Court considered defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history, including a conviction for escape in the first degree arising from his escape from jail in 2001, his prison disciplinary record and his failure to take responsibility for his crimes. The court also took into account defendant\u2019s accomplishments while in prison, but concluded that substantial justice would not be served by resentencing in light of the other factors. Under the circumstances presented, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion (see People v Davis, 128 AD3d at 1270; People v Allen, 118 AD3d 1048, 1049 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 958 [2014]; People v Buckery, 98 AD3d 1191 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1009 [2013]). We have considered the contentions raised in defendant\u2019s pro se brief and find them to be unavailing.\nMcCarthy, Garry, Rose and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the order is affirmed. [/INST] The County Court of Chemung County denied the defendant's motion for resentencing under CPL 440.46, initially citing his ineligibility due to a prior violent felony conviction. Although this was later found to be an error, the court considered the merits of the motion and ultimately concluded that substantial justice would not be served by resentencing the defendant, given his extensive criminal history and prison disciplinary record. The appellate court affirmed the County Court's decision, stating that there was no abuse of discretion.</s>"}

The plea agreement provided that defendant would successfully complete drug treatment and then enter the Judicial Diversion Program (hereinafter JDP) (see CPL 216.05) and that, upon his successful completion of the JDP, he could withdraw his guilty plea and enter a plea to a misdemeanor. The agreement contemplated that if defendant failed to abide by the conditions of the JDP, he could be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term up to 3V2 to 7 years. Pursuant to the agreement, defendant signed a plea memorandum outlining those plea terms, admitted his predicate felony and agreed to waive his right to appeal. He successfully completed substance abuse treatment, was accepted into the JDP and signed a JDP contract. In September 2014, defendant admitted that he had absconded from the drug court program and violated the JDP contract conditions by failing to report to drug court and by using drugs. County Court terminated him from the JDP and imposed a prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. Defendant\u2019s subsequent motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment was denied. Defendant now appeals from the judgment and, with permission, from the order denying his motion to vacate.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, which survives the unchallenged appeal waiver (see People v Moulton, 134 AD3d 1251, 1252 [2015]), was not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion pursuant to CPL 220.60 (3), despite ample opportunity to do so within the many months between his guilty plea and sentencing (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1471 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1162 [2015]; see also People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 363-364 [2013]; People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182 [2013]). A review of the plea allocution discloses that defendant did not say anything that raised significant doubt as to his guilt or called into question the voluntariness of his guilty plea so as to bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-666 [1988]; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d at 1231; see also People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 220 [2016]).\nNext, defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment was premised upon the claim that, as relevant here, his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, in that counsel failed to disclose to him (or the prosecutor) that a witness had signed an exculpatory affidavit prior to his guilty plea. Specifically, the witness asserted that she had reviewed a photo supplied by the People, taken from the convenience store surveillance video, and that the woman depicted therein was her but that the man next to her in the photo was not defendant, who she knew, and that she did not witness him use a stolen credit card on that day. Initially, while defendant claimed in his affidavit in support of the motion that counsel did not disclose the affidavit to him, he did not allege that he was unaware of it, and his letter to counsel submitted in support of the motion suggests that he was aware of it. Even assuming that defendant was unaware of the affidavit, a letter to defendant from defense counsel explained that the purpose of the affidavit was to impeach the witness if she were called by the People to testify; as the charges were resolved with a plea, there was no need to admit the affidavit into evidence. Notably, two police officers identified defendant as the person in the surveillance video and, when confronted with pictures taken from that video, defendant admitted that it was him depicted in that video and that he had made purchases at the convenience store that day, and he later disclosed that he had obtained the credit card from \u201ca girl.\u201d In view of this strong evidence of guilt, and given that the record establishes that defendant received a favorable plea agreement that would have allowed him to avoid a felony conviction and prison had he complied with the drug court conditions, we are unpersuaded that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary due to any ineffective assistance of counsel or that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about the affidavit (see People v Soprano, 135 AD3d 1243, 1243 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1007 [2016]; People v Gonzalez, 130 AD3d 1089, 1090 [2015]).

Given that defendant did not establish that his plea was procured by misrepresentation or fraud \u201con the part of the court or a prosecutor\u201d (CPL 440.10 [1] [b]), this aspect of his motion to vacate was properly denied. [/INST] The court upheld a judgment convicting the defendant of second-degree forgery following his guilty plea, which stemmed from using a stolen credit card.

Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to 5V2 to 11 years in prison. Defendant now appeals, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and harsh and excessive sentence.\nWe affirm. To the extent that defendant\u2019s challenge to the effectiveness of counsel impacts upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, the claim survives the waiver of the right to appeal, but defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders the issue unpreserved for our review (see People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]).

Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, as well as in satisfaction of certain outstanding charges and an ongoing investigation concerning defendant\u2019s unauthorized use of her mother\u2019s credit card. Sentencing was adjourned for one year with the understanding that defendant was to complete a long-term residential drug and alcohol treatment program. After completing this program, defendant was to be sentenced to time served plus five years of probation. However, it was also understood that if defendant failed to complete the rehabilitation program, she may be sentenced to a prison term of up to 5\u00bd years.\nThree months after entering the rehabilitation program, defendant was discharged for violating program rules. Based on defendant\u2019s failure to complete the rehabilitation program, County Court found her in violation of her plea agreement and sentenced her to a term of 5\u00bd years in prison, with two years of postrelease supervision, and ordered her to pay restitution of $848.33 based on her unauthorized use of her mother\u2019s credit card. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant initially contends that there was insufficient evidence that she violated the plea agreement. We disagree. County Court held a hearing where evidence was presented that defendant had violated program rules, including, among other things, testing positive for opiates and having beer hidden in her luggage. Therefore, we find that County Court\u2019s inquiry was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant had failed to successfully complete the long-term rehabilitation program and had violated the plea agreement (see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]; People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712 [1993]).\nHowever, defendant\u2019s plea agreement, which satisfied outstanding charges and ongoing investigations against her, including the investigation concerning the unauthorized use of her mother\u2019s credit card, did not include the payment of restitution. As the plea agreement did not include restitution or the possibility that restitution might be imposed, this matter must be remitted to County Court to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw her plea or accept the enhanced sentence. Alternatively, the court may resentence defendant as promised in the plea agreement (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 978 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 925 [2007]; People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708-709 [2005]).\nFinally, as defendant validly waived her right to appeal, she is precluded from contending that her sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Cross, 42 AD3d 586, 587 [2007]; People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).\nCrew III, J.P., Spain, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

[/INST] The appellate court reviewed the defendant's conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and subsequent sentencing after she violated her plea agreement by failing to complete a rehabilitation program. While the court found sufficient evidence of her violation, it determined that the plea agreement did not include restitution for unauthorized credit card use, necessitating a remand to the County Court to allow the defendant to either withdraw her plea or accept the enhanced sentence. The court also noted that the defendant waived her right to appeal regarding the harshness of her sentence.</s>"}

He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to a prison term of seven years to life. Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that his plea was not voluntary, knowing or intelligent and should be vacated on the ground that the assistance rendered by his attorneys was ineffective.\nDefendant premises his claim of ineffective assistance on the fact that between his arraignment and the plea allocution he was represented by four different attorneys. He concludes that because of this turnover, the case against him could not have been adequately investigated. We find nothing in the record to support his argument.\nTo the contrary, the record reveals that defendant was adequately represented at all pretrial proceedings. Notably, the attorney ultimately assigned to him successfully negotiated a very favorable plea which enabled defendant to plead guilty to one count of a nine-count indictment and avoid significant additional penal exposure. Moreover, during the plea allocution defendant did not indicate any dissatisfaction with the turnover of counsel or with his current counsel, and denied being threatened, forced or coerced into pleading guilty. In our view, the advantageous plea, combined with the lack of record evidence which would cast doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel, convinces us that the assistance rendered was meaningful (see, People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941; People v Torres, 227 AD2d 716, lvs denied 88 NY2d 995, 996). Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to vacate the conviction.\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, White and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, following his guilty plea.

Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree. He was sentenced, as a predicate felony offender, to one year in jail and directed to make financial restitution to the victim. Defendant appeals, contending that the People failed to abide by the terms of a plea bargain agreement whereby they allegedly were to recommend five years\u2019 probation, rather than jail time.\nOur review of the record reveals, however, that no plea bargain agreement was reached. Negotiations came to an impasse when defendant refused to agree to pay restitution in the amount of $3,200 and insisted upon a restitution hearing. At that point the People withdrew their original offer, stating on the record that no plea bargain agreement had been made; Nevertheless, defendant proceeded with his guilty plea, after explicitly confirming his understanding of the fact that the People would not be bound by their earlier recommendation. Since there was no agreement, the People had no obligation to abide by the terms suggested during the negotiation process.\nWe reject the contention that the sentence of one year in jail was harsh and excessive. The sentence was within the statutory guidelines and in view of defendant\u2019s previous criminal record and the violent nature of his crime, does not represent an abuse of discretion (see, People v Burnett, 228 AD2d 788, 792).\nCardona, P.

At the conclusion of a combined Mapp/Dunaway hearing, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized. Thereafter, pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, challenging the denial of his suppression motion.\nNotably, defendant does not attack the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal, and the record confirms that it was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. During the plea colloquy, County Court fully informed defendant of the separate and distinct right that was being waived and the consequences thereof, and addressed it separately from those rights being forfeited upon defendant\u2019s guilty plea. Defendant confirmed his understanding that he was giving up his right to appeal from all aspects of the case, including everything that had already occurred, and counsel fully joined in the waiver.

Defendant subsequently waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime charged in exchange for the People\u2019s promise to recommend a term of imprisonment of two years. Prior to accepting his plea, County Court advised defendant that a period of postrelease supervision of one to two years would be imposed and that no promises or commitments were otherwise being made regarding sentencing. Subsequently, although the People recommended a two-year prison term, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea based on his sentence exceeding the term the People agreed to recommend pursuant to the plea agreement. While defendant did move to vacate his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20, his failure to make a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment renders this issue unpreserved for review (see People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]; People v Hartford, 217 AD2d 798, 800 [1995]). Moreover, reversal in the interest of justice is unwarranted. While a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea when the plea was induced by a court\u2019s sentencing promise and the court subsequently finds that sentence to be inappropriate (see People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340, 346 [1980]; People v Martin, 17 AD3d 775, 776 [2005]), County Court explicitly informed defendant during the plea allocution that there were no promises being made regarding his sentence and advised him of the potential maximum sentence that he faced, which he indicated that he understood. Absent a commitment by the court to sentence defendant pursuant to the People\u2019s recommendation, the imposition of a harsher sentence did not entitle him to withdraw his plea (see People v Bunce, 45 AD3d 982, 984 [2007]; People v McKenzie, 28 AD3d 942, 943 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Hartford, 217 AD2d at 799-800). Finally, while we agree with the People that County Court\u2019s remarks regarding the \u201cIndian Nation\u201d were \u201cintemperate\u201d and would have been better left unsaid, the sentence imposed was not harsh and excessive given the enormous amount of contraband involved herein.\nPeters, Carpinello, Rose and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014Cardona, P. J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Sheridan, J.), rendered July 9, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and resisting arrest.\nDefendant was charged in a nine-count indictment with \"various crimes involving the sale and possession of controlled substances. Following various negotiations, defendant agreed to plead guilty to the entire indictment in exchange for County Court\u2019s promise to impose an aggregate sentence of 4V2 to 9 years. Thereafter, the court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison sentence of 4V2 to 9 years for each conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and each conviction of criminal, possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts). Defendant also received an indeterminate prison sentence of 2 to 4 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and a one-year determinate jail sentence for his conviction of resisting arrest. The court indicated that all sentences were to run concurrently.\nIn this appeal, defendant asserts that the indictment was defective because his prior felony conviction was not set forth in the indictment. As a result, defendant argues that he should not have been sentenced as a second felony offender. We do not agree. Defendant\u2019s reliance upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Apprendi v New Jersey (530 US 466) is misplaced. The Court in Apprendi specifically stated that \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d is not required to be submitted to a jury (id., at 490). Moreover, the Court of Appeals has stated that a \u201c [defendant [has] no constitutional right to a jury trial to establish the facts of * * * prior felony convictions\u201d (People v Rosen, 96 NY2d 329, 335). Under these circumstances, defendant, previously sentenced as a predicate felon (see, e.g., People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982), and admitting the prior felony conviction at sentencing herein, cannot persuasively maintain that he was prejudiced by the fact that the existence of the prior felony was not contained in the indictment or discussed at any length during the plea allocution. Notably, defendant received the exact sentence promised during that allocution.\nNext, defendant claims that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest with the Public Defender\u2019s office created due to his complaints concerning the effectiveness of different attorneys from that office in a prior appeal (People v Conyers, supra). We note that defendant\u2019s attorney herein was not a member of that office at the time. Significantly, this Court was not persuaded by defendant\u2019s allegations concerning his former counsel (id.) and, in any event, defendant\u2019s argument of a conflict of interest is not supported in this record. More importantly, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel made appropriate motions and went to great lengths to ensure that defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the alleged conflict of interest were placed on the record. Additionally, defense counsel negotiated a reasonable plea agreement for defendant and there exists no basis in this record to support defendant\u2019s claim that he was prevented by his counsel from testifying before the Grand Jury. Notably, even if defendant could establish that defense counsel failed to effectuate his intent to testify before the Grand Jury, such a fact, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872; People v Williams, 267 AD2d 772, lvs denied 94 NY2d 886, 926). Thus, we find that defendant received \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d within the appropriate standard (People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796, 799-800; see, People v Sowizdral, 275 AD2d 473, 475-476, lv denied 95 NY2d 969).\nDefendant further contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive and should be modified. Here, County Court was aware of defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal record and imposed concurrent sentences all within the statutory guidelines and in accordance with the plea bargain. Therefore, we find no reason to disturb the court\u2019s sentencing determination (see, People v Archangel, 272 AD2d 686).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments have been examined and found to be without merit.\nMercure, Crew III, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal from the Rensselaer County Court's judgment, which convicted the defendant of multiple drug-related offenses and resisting arrest, was upheld. The court found that the indictment was not defective despite the absence of the prior felony conviction in the indictment, as per the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court and New York's Court of Appeals. Additionally, the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the sentence was excessively harsh were dismissed, as the court noted that the defendant received meaningful representation and the sentence complied with statutory guidelines.</s>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of four years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Sentencing was adjourned and defendant was released to get his affairs in order, with the requirement that he was to report to jail one week later. Defendant failed to report to jail and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was subsequently arrested on a new charge of criminal contempt in the second degree. Defendant thereafter agreed to be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of five years, with two years of postrelease supervision, on his plea of guilty to unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, with the understanding that the enhanced sentence would satisfy the criminal contempt charge, as well as any other pending charges. The agreement also included a waiver of the right to appeal. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence and defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we agree with defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, inasmuch as the record does not demonstrate that defendant understood that the appeal waiver was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 263-264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Although defendant\u2019s sole remaining claim\u2014that his sentence was harsh and excessive\u2014is properly before us, we find it unpersuasive. Defendant was advised at the time that he entered his plea of the consequences of being arrested while on release, and he waived any challenges regarding the enhanced sentence in exchange for the promise that his plea would satisfy both the new charge and any pending charges (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Lord, 128 AD3d 1277, 1278-1279 [2015]). In light of the foregoing, as well as defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence (see People v Kerwin, 117 AD3d 1097, 1098 [2014]; People v Williams, 101 AD3d 1174, 1174-1175 [2012]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Devine and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Defendant now appeals, contending only that the waiver of the right to appeal was invalid and that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. Initially, the People concede \u2014 and our review of the record confirms \u2014 \u201cthat defendant did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive her right to appeal her conviction and sentence\u201d (People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d 1462, 1463 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1042 [2014]; see People v Larose, 120 AD3d 1442, 1442 n [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1045 [2014]). As a result, defendant is not precluded from challenging the perceived severity of her sentence (see People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d at 1463). That said, upon reviewing the record as a whole and taking into account defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence, nor do we find any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d at 1463; People v Howard, 111 AD3d 1021, 1021-1022 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1199 [2014]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]).

Thereafter, defendant, assisted by counsel, executed a written waiver in open court that also reflected that counsel had advised her of her right to appeal, and that she had discussed the waiver with counsel and was freely waiving such right. Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s appeal waiver is valid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Vaughns, 70 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010]; People v Mosher, 45 AD3d 970, 970 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008] ).

As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to six months in jail and five years\u2019 probation. In addition to the Parker admonishment executed by defendant, County Court advised defendant that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if he did not appear for sentencing, in which case the court could impose the maximum sentence of 2Vs to 7 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant failed to appear for sentencing scheduled in August 2000 and a bench warrant was issued.

After the court recessed, a juror notified the Court Clerk that he recognized the first witness, an undercover officer, although he had not recognized the officer\u2019s name on the list of prospective witnesses. When the trial reconvened the following Monday, the court informed the parties what had occurred and they questioned the juror in chambers. The juror told the court and the attorneys that he knew the officer from church and no longer felt he could hear the case without prejudice. However, he insisted that all he had told his fellow jurors was that he knew the officer from church, and that he had said nothing about the officer\u2019s credibility. With the consent of the parties, the court discharged the juror and, in open court, asked the remaining assembled jurors whether, as a result of conversations with the discharged juror, anyone of them felt unable to \"listen to the testimony objectively and fairly not only for the defendant * * * but for the People as well\u201d. The court instructed any juror with such reservations to raise his or her hand, at which point the matter would be discussed in chambers outside the presence of the other jurors. No juror responded. The defense counsel then moved for a mistrial on the ground that the discharged juror\u2019s statements to the other jurors had contaminated the jury. The court denied the motion.\nWe disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the court improvidently exercised its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. As the Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated, \"[bjecause juror misconduct can take many forms, no ironclad rule of decision is possible. In each case the facts must be examined to determine the nature of the material placed before the jury and the likelihood that prejudice would be engendered\u201d (People v Brown, 48 NY2d 388, 394; see also, People v Testa, 61 NY2d 1008; People v Sullivan, 167 AD2d 564). Here, after a thorough and searching inquiry, the court properly determined that the comments made by the discharged juror to the other jurors were not likely to result in substantial prejudice. Therefore, a mistrial was not warranted (see, People v Castillo, 144 AD2d 376; People v Costello, 104 AD2d 947).\nWe find that the defendant\u2019s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated.\nWe have considered the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.

Furthermore, the People agreed to have the sentence served in a substance abuse treatment program, on the condition that they were satisfied, based upon the presentence investigation report, that such treatment was warranted. County Court cautioned defendant that, even if the People consented, the program may not be available because he was subject to a parole hold. Ultimately, the People did not consent to the treatment program and defendant was sentenced as a second nonviolent felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Although these claims, including the effective assistance of counsel argument to the extent that it impacts upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, are not precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal, they are unpreserved for our review due to defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Were we to consider defendant\u2019s arguments, we would find them to be without merit. The record reveals that defendant was fully informed about and understood the terms of the plea agreement. County Court thoroughly advised defendant of the rights he was relinquishing and he acknowledged that he understood those rights. Defendant also confirmed that he was acting voluntarily and that he had enough time to consider the plea and to consult with counsel. Additionally, there is nothing in the record which casts doubt upon the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see id.). We are satisfied that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Stone, 9 AD3d 498, 499 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 712 [2004]; People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742-743 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]).

Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on appeal on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised. We agree. A review of the records and briefs in this case, including the arguments raised by defendant in her pro se brief, reveal that there are no nonfrivolous issues which could be raised and therefore defense counsel\u2019s application to withdraw should be granted.\nWe do note, however, that during the plea proceedings the People recommended and defendant accepted that she be sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 41/2 to 9 years. The People repeated the terms of the promise at the outset of the sentence proceedings. At sentencing, however, County Court imposed a term of 4 to 9 years. All indications in the record support the conclusion that the court merely misspoke and intended the sentence to be the sentence proffered by the People and defendant (see, People v Brown, 205 AD2d 854, lv denied 84 NY2d 866). In fact, by statute the recommended sentence of 41/2 to 9 years was the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [4] [b]).

During the course of the plea allocution, defendant waived his right to appeal everything but the sentence. With respect to the plea bargain, the prosecutor indicated that, regarding sentence, the agreement included no incarceration and a fixed amount of restitution, \u201cbut allowing the court other options including fines * * * community service, restitution, probation, and the waiver of appeal of everything other than sentence\u201d. The sole commitment from County Court was its agreement not to impose any sentence of incarceration. At sentencing, County Court imposed, inter alia, the agreed-upon restitution as well as 800 hours of community service. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the community service portion of the sentence imposed by County Court.\nUpon review of the record, we conclude, and the People concede, that the record does not support a finding that County Court complied with the requirements of Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 with respect to the imposition of community service. Notably, Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) (h) permits imposition of community service for misdemeanor convictions such as this one, however, it only does so \u201cwhere the defendant has consented to the amount and conditions of such service\u201d. Thus, while there can be no question from the plea allocution that a general consent to the possibility of community service as a valid sentencing option can be inferred (cf., People v Suros, 209 AD2d 203, lv denied 85 NY2d 943, cert denied 516 US 862), there is no proof whatsoever on the record that defendant consented to the amount and conditions of the community service actually imposed by County Court, which is what is specifically required by the statute.

The charges stemmed from allegations that defendant twice sold cocaine to a confidential informant. After conducting a Wade hearing, County Court concluded that the identification procedure employed by the police in securing the confidential informant\u2019s identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive and denied his motion to suppress. Thereafter, defendant entered a guilty plea to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived his right to appeal, and was sentenced as a second felony offender \u2014 in accord with the plea agreement \u2014 to 4V2 years in prison, plus two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court improperly denied his motion to suppress, his plea allocution was factually insufficient, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to County Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress is precluded by his waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Spruill, 90 AD3d 1242, 1243 [2011]; People v Ballard, 88 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 955 [2012]). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his guilty plea is also barred by the appeal waiver and, moreover, is unpreserved as there is no indication on this record that he moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Taylor, 89 AD3d 1143, 1143 [2011]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1317-1318 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1292 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]).\nAs for defendant\u2019s claim regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, he argues that trial counsel should have moved to suppress audiotapes made by the confidential informant when the sales allegedly took place and maintains that the specter of those tapes being used as evidence against him impacted the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Assuming that counsel\u2019s failure to make such a motion could raise a question regarding the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s guilty plea (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2010]), he has not preserved this issue because he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Irvis, 90 AD3d 1302, 1304 [2011]; People v Cassara, 88 AD3d 1069, 1069 [2011]). In any event, the record establishes that defendant obtained a favorable plea agreement, stated during his plea allocution that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s efforts on his behalf and acknowledged having ample time to discuss with counsel the terms of the guilty plea before entering it. Therefore, were we to reach the issue we would find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d at 1384).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver precludes any claim that his sentence was harsh or excessive (see People v Jones, 88 AD3d 1029 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 859 [2011]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d at 1292).\nPeters, P.J., Malone Jr., Stein and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nDefendant does not challenge the validity of the waiver of his right to appeal and, upon our review, we find it was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Ballard, 88 AD3d at 1026). [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal. The defendant's challenges to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence and the sufficiency of his plea were barred by this waiver, and his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were deemed unpreserved since he did not seek to withdraw his plea. The court found that he received meaningful representation and that his sentence was not harsh or excessive, as he entered the waiver knowingly and voluntarily.</s>"}

He was 24 years old at the time of the plea. The defendant admitted that he sold controlled substances on four occasions between October and November 2011, for a combined total sum of $360. After failing to comply with all of the terms of his plea agreement, which required, inter alia, participation in a drug treatment program, the defendant, who had a history of substance abuse, was subsequently sentenced to a determinate term of 10 years imprisonment on each count. The County Court directed that the four terms of imprisonment run consecutively to each other, for a total aggregate term of 40 years of imprisonment.\nThe People contend that this Court is precluded from reviewing many of the contentions raised by the defendant on this appeal, since he validly waived his right to appeal during the plea proceeding. Contrary to the People\u2019s contention, however, the defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to appeal (see generally People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011]; People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133, 140 [2014]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of the effec tive assistance of counsel is based, in part, on matter appearing on the record and, in part, on matter outside the record and, thus, constitutes a \u201cmixed claim\u201d of ineffective assistance (People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2011]; see People v Evans, 16 NY3d 571, 575 n 2 [2011]). In this case, it is not evident from the matter appearing on the record that the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel (cf. People v Crump, 53 NY2d 824, 825 [1981]; People v Brown, 45 NY2d 852, 853-854 [1978]). Since the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved without reference to matter outside the record, a CPL 440.10 proceeding is the appropriate forum for reviewing the claim in its entirety (see People v Freeman, 93 AD3d 805, 806 [2012]; People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d at 1109). However, the contentions raised in the defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 are not properly before this Court on the appeal from the judgment inasmuch as the defendant did not seek leave to appeal from the order denying that motion (see People v Washington, 45 AD3d 880 [2007]; People v Wynn, 40 AD3d 893 [2007]).\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying his request for an adjournment prior to sentencing (see People v Struss, 79 AD3d 773, 774 [2010]; People v McRae, 62 AD3d 723, 724 [2009]).\nHowever, the sentence imposed was excessive to the extent that the County Court directed that the four determinate terms run consecutively to each other. Accordingly, we modify the judgment as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice by providing that the terms of imprisonment imposed upon the defendant\u2019s conviction of each of the four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree shall run concurrently with each other.\nHall, J.P., Sgroi, Miller and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.

The court found that the defendant did not validly waive his right to appeal and that his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were better suited for a separate CPL 440.10 proceeding.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nLynch, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered February 14, 2012, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).\nOn January 21, 2010, defendant was charged in a felony complaint with a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, based on the sale of one half of an 80 milligram Oxycontin pill to a police informant in August 2009. Thereafter, on July 29, 2010, defendant was indicted and charged with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree: the first count was based on the August 5, 2009 event underlying the felony complaint, and the remaining counts were based on two sales of the same amount of Oxycontin to the same informant on August 24, 2009. The People also announced their readiness for trial on July 29, 2010.\nDefendant thereafter moved to dismiss the indictment based on statutory speedy trial grounds. The People conceded that count 1 was untimely, but otherwise opposed the motion. County Court initially granted the motion, but, upon the People\u2019s letter request to reconsider, ultimately reinstated counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on both counts and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of four years on each count followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nUpon the filing of a felony complaint commencing a criminal action, the People must be ready for trial within six months (see CPL 30.30 [1] [a]; People v Nelson, 68 AD3d 1252, 1253 [2009]). A criminal action is commenced upon the filing of the first accusatory instrument (see CPL 1.20 [16] [a]) and \u201cincludes the filing of all further accusatory instruments directly derived from the initial one\u201d (CPL 1.20 [16] [b] [emphasis added]; accord People ex rel. Greenstein v Sheriff of Schenectady County, 220 AD2d 190, 192 [1996]). Here, the issue distills to whether counts 2 and 3 of the indictment are directly derived from the felony complaint as part of the same criminal transaction (see People v Lowman, 103 AD3d 976, 977 [2013]). If so, the speedy trial time frame would relate back to the filing of the felony complaint; if not, that time period would be triggered by the indictment (see id.; People v Nelson, 68 AD3d at 1254; People v Dearstyne, 230 AD2d 953, 955 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 921 [1996]).\nAs a threshold point, citing to CPL 210.20 (4), defendant maintains that, after dismissing the indictment, County Court lacked authority to reconsider the matter simply on the basis of the People\u2019s letter request. We disagree. CPL 210.20 (4) speaks to the court\u2019s authority to authorize the People to resubmit a charge to the grand jury, but only where the indictment is dismissed on certain grounds that do not include a speedy trial violation (see CPL 210.20 [1] [g]; [4]). The question here, however, is whether the court retains inherent authority to rectify a prior error in dismissing an indictment, and it is our\nview that the court has such authority (see People v Rosa, 265 AD2d 167, 167 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 884 [2000]; People v Clarke, 203 AD2d 916, 916 [1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 965 [1994]; see also People v Lynch, 162 AD2d 134, 134 [1990], lv denied 76 NY2d 941 [1990]). Although no formal reargument motion was made, which would have been preferable, the letter request alerted the court to the error, and the court conducted a hearing before finalizing the reinstatement of counts 2 and 3. Since defendant was given a full opportunity to be heard on the reinstatement request, we perceive no error.\nThe further question is whether the events alleged in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment are part of the same criminal transaction as count 1 (see CPL 40.10 [2] [b]). Although each sale involved the identical amount of Oxycontin and the same participants, we find no error in County Court\u2019s conclusion that the two separate sales on August 24, 2009 were separate and distinct from the transaction occurring almost three weeks earlier (see People v Sant, 120 AD3d 517, 518-519 [2014]; People v Lowman, 103 AD3d at 977-978; People v Brown, 20 AD3d 577, 578-579 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 826 [2005]; People v Dearstyne, 230 AD2d at 955). As such, the speedy trial period for counts 2 and 3 commenced with the filing of the indictment, not the earlier felony complaint. It follows that County Court properly denied defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion as to these counts of the indictment.\nLahtinen, J.P., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, concluding that the speedy trial timeframe for these counts began with the indictment, not the earlier felony complaint. The court found that the two sales on August 24, 2009, were distinct transactions from the earlier sale, and upheld the County Court's authority to reinstate counts after initially dismissing the indictment. The defendant's appeal was denied, and the sentences of four years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision were upheld.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered February 14, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of seven years to life. Defendant raises four issues on this appeal. He first contends that it was reversible error to allow testimony of the undercover officer concerning three other drug related transactions with defendant for which defendant was not on trial. This contention is without merit. Due to an alleged alibi defense, identity became a major issue in the case. Evidence of other offenses is admissible where the sole purpose is to establish identity and the evidence is relevant to that issue. (People v Molineux, 168 NY 264; see, also, People v Condon, 26 NY2d 139, 142.) Next, defendant urges that there was a fatal defect in the chain of possession of the packages of heroin from the time they were purchased from defendant until they were finally examined by the chemist. On this record we find no apparent gap. The exhibit was properly sealed by the undercover officer and placed in an evidence locker at State Police headquarters. Later, it was taken by him to the State Police laboratory in Albany and turned over to the evidence clerk. The chemist testified that, after it was brought to the laboratory, it was placed in an evidence locker in a walk-in vault in the laboratory. Subsequently, he removed the exhibit from the vault and performed the chemical analysis on its contents. There is no suggestion in the record that the evidence was altered in any way up to the time of the chemist\u2019s analysis. Under the circumstances, the chain of possession was adequately established. (People v Connelly, 35 NY2d 171; People v Porter, 46 AD2d 307.) Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions also lack merit. The District Attorney\u2019s statements in his summation did not go beyond the normal scope of fair advocacy. Moreover, if there was error, it was harmless and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. Moreover, none of the ascribed errors are constitutional in nature. Furthermore, the proof of defendant\u2019s guilt, without reference to the alleged errors, was overwhelming. In our view there is no significant probability that the jury would have acquitted the defendant had it not been for the alleged errors. (People v Crimmina, 36 NY2d 230.) Finally, the Court of Appeals has recently put to rest the unconstitutional attack on the mandatory sentencing provisions of the statutes applied to defendant\u2019s conviction. (People v Venable, 37 NY2d 100.) Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J. P., Sweeney, Kane, Main and Reynolds, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Albany County's conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance was denied on multiple grounds. The court found that the admission of testimony regarding other drug transactions was relevant to establish identity due to the defendant's alibi defense. Additionally, the chain of possession for the evidence was adequately maintained, and the prosecution's arguments did not compromise the fairness of the trial. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that any alleged errors were harmless and did not impact the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.</s>"}

Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a nonviolent predicate felony offender, a prison sentence of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we find that defendant\u2019s oral and written waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 339-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). The record reflects that County Court distinguished the right to appeal as \u201cseparate and apart\u201d from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea, and defendant acknowledged that he signed and understood the written appeal waiver after reviewing it and conferring with counsel regarding its contents (see People v Hall, 147 AD3d 1151, 1151 [2017]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017]). While defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives the appeal waiver, this claim was not preserved by an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1132 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]; People v Waite, 120 AD3d 1446, 1447 [2014]), and defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that triggered the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 219-220 [2016]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Austin, 141 AD3d 956, 957 [2016]).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that the sentence was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by the valid appeal waiver (see People v Macon, 142 AD3d 739, 739 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]; People v Rushlow, 137 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2016]), which includes his \u201cright to invoke [this Court\u2019s] interest-of-justice jurisdiction to reduce the sentence\u201d (People v Bethea, 133 AD3d 1033, 1033 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 27 NY3d 992 [2016]). To the extent that defendant raises a claim regarding what counsel investigated or discussed with him, this concerns a matter that is outside the record on appeal and is more properly suited for a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Daniels, 139 AD3d 1256, 1257 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1183 [2017]; People v Taylor, 135 AD3d 1237, 1238 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1075 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Devine and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Addiction Control Commission for an indeterminate term of not more than 36 months. Judgment reversed, on the law and the facts, defendant\u2019s plea of guilty vacated, indictment reinstated, and ease remitted to the County Court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. At the time defendant pleaded guilty, the County Court' had \u201c reasonable cause to believe that the defendant * * * [was] a narcotic addict\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208, subd. 1). The court therefore had the clear duty under subdivision 1 of section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law to so notify defendant and afford him \u201c an opportunity to admit, deny or stand mute with respect to the issue of whether he * *\u2022 * [was or was] not a narcotic addict.\u201d In our opinion, defendant was not so notified; nor was he given an opportunity to contest the issue. Moreover, the court abused its discretion under section 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when it refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea once he learned that the plea, when taken together with his being found to be an addict, meant that certification to the care and custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission was mandatory under subdivision 4 of section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The record seems to indicate that had defendant been cognizant, before he pleaded guilty, of the fact that such certification would thus have to follow, he might well have pleaded not guilty and gone to trial, both on the question of his commission of the crimes for which he was indicted and on the question of his addiction (under Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208). This is because he apparently wanted to be sentenced to a shorter term in jail under the Penal Law, rather than certified to the care and custody of the commission for an indefinite period of up to 36 months under the Mental Hygiene Law. In these circumstances, he should be allowed to withdraw his plea. Beldoek, P. J., Christ, Munder, Martuseello and Kleinfeld, JJ., concur.

At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that this crime is a class A-II felony when in fact it is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.43, 110.05 [1]). The promised sentence was imposed and constituted an illegally-low term of imprisonment for a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). Under the circumstances, the judgment should be modified, in the interests of justice, by reducing the conviction to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.41) in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489; cf., People v Alvarez, 166 AD2d 603).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal unanimously held in abeyance from judgment, Supreme Court, New York County, entered September 9, 1976, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilcy, of criminal sale of a controlled substance, third degree, and imposing a term of one year to life imprisonment. The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this memorandum. The facts are that defendant sold controlled substances to a police officer on October 16, 23 and 27, 1975, and an indictment was filed on November 1, 1975, accusing him of these sales. Another indictment was filed on February 27, 1976, alleging a sale of October 7, 1975. On June 17, 1976, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale under the first indictment in satisfaction of both indictments and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one year to life imprisonment. Defendant now argues that when he took the plea on June 17, 1976, neither he, the court, prosecutor, nor defense counsel was aware of an amendment, effective July 1, 1976, to GPL 220.10 (subd 5, par [b]) which might have permitted him to plead down to as low as a class C felony. GPL 220.60 is clear that the court has discretion at any time before sentence to permit withdrawal of a previously entered plea of guilty, and although the respondent argues persuasively that the change in the law had been so publicized as to put the legal community on notice of it, nowhere does the record show that this change was known to either court or defense. On approving chapter 480 of the Laws of 1976, Governor Carey pointed out (McKinney\u2019s Session Law News, No. 7 p A-356) that the A-III drug felony is the only criminal offense for which no lesser plea may be entered, despite the fact that limited plea bargaining was permitted in more serious drug offenses, and unlimited plea bargaining is available for all serious nondrug offenses. Passage of the bill was intended, obviously, to eliminate this inequity, and it would be in the interest of justice to permit the trial court to determine whether defendant should be afforded access to the benefits of this legislation. On the state of the record before us we are unable to determine whether or not the trial court exercised the discretion reposed in her by the amendment to the statute. We remand, therefore, for the specific exercise of such discretion to grant or deny an application by defendant to withdraw his plea under the circumstances outlined above. Concur\u2014Birns, J. P., Evans, Lane and Markewich, JJ. [/INST] The appeal from a 1976 conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance is held in abeyance and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

In imposing the sentence, the record demonstrates that County Court appropriately considered evidence tending to establish defendant\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking as well as defendant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for his actions and his lack of remorse. Notwithstanding the fact that the sentence imposed was much more severe than that offered to defendant in a proposed pretrial plea agreement, defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed was in retaliation for exercising his right to trial is not supported by the record (see, e.g., People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838). Finally, because defendant was convicted after a trial upon legally sufficient evidence, he is precluded from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence before the Grand Jury (see, People v Carey, 241 AD2d 748, 751, lv denied 90 NY2d 1010; People v Schulze, 224 AD2d 729, lv denied 88 NY2d 853).\nCardona, P.

While County Court agreed to sentence defendant to probation, defendant was warned that a prison term of up to lx/2 years could be imposed if he continued to use illicit substances such as marihuana, failed to comply with supervised release requirements or did not appear for sentencing. Defendant failed to abide by those conditions by, among other things, using marihuana, and County Court accordingly sentenced him to a jail term of one year. Upon defendant\u2019s appeal, we affirm.\nAs an initial matter, County Court separately explained the rights encompassed by an appeal waiver during the plea colloquy, and defendant thereafter stated that he was freely waiving his right to appeal and executed a detailed written waiver in which he affirmed his understanding of the waiver and indicated that he had ample time to discuss the matter with counsel. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s appeal waiver was a knowing, intelligent and voluntary one (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1231-1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea\u2014 unlike his argument regarding the factual sufficiency of that plea\u2014survives that waiver, but is unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d 987, 987 [2010]; People v Empey, 73 AD3d at 1388). Moreover, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that negated an element of the crime or otherwise called his guilt into question, this case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d at 987; People v Clinton, 22 AD3d 887, 887-888 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 811 [2006]).\nNext, County Court was free to impose an enhanced sentence without offering defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea, as he was warned at the time of his guilty plea that County Court \u201ccould impose a different sentence if [he] failed to meet specified conditions\u201d and admittedly violated such a condition by using marihuana (People v Wilson, 69 AD3d 970, 971 [2010]; see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Holmes, 67 AD3d 1069, 1071 [2009]). Defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver, as he was advised of the maximum sentence that could be imposed if he violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 813 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]).\nMercure, J.P., Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Thomas v New York, 574 US \u2014, 135 S Ct 90 [2014]). At the 2005 plea proceeding, which addressed the 2002 and 2005 cases after defendant had absconded before the scheduled sentencing on his 2002 conviction, the court did raise the issue of deportation. However, defendant was deprived of effective assistance when his counsel undermined the court\u2019s warning and understated the potential for deportation by remarking that the plea would \u201cnot necessarily\u201d result in deportation, and that defendant only \u201cmight be deported\u201d (see People v Hemans, 132 AD3d 428 [1st Dept 2015]). In fact, it was clear that defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to an aggravated felony triggered mandatory deportation under federal law (see 8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [A] [iii]).\nDefendant should be afforded the opportunity to move to vacate his plea upon a showing that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he would not have pleaded guilty had he been made aware of the deportation consequences of his plea (see Peque, 22 NY3d at 199-200; see also People v Chacko, 99 AD3d 527 [1st Dept 2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1060 [2013]).

We also reject defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to outright reversal of the judgment on a separate ground of involuntariness. Although defendant received erroneous information as to his potential sentence in the event he violated the conditions of the plea agreement, this reference to a sentence greater than the maximum legally permissible term could not have \u201cinduced\u201d him to plead guilty (People v Monroe, 21 NY3d 875, 878 [2013]).

[/INST] The New York Supreme Court has held an appeal in abeyance and remanded the case for further proceedings after finding that the defendant was not adequately warned about the potential for deportation during his plea hearings. The court determined that the defendant's counsel provided ineffective assistance by downplaying the likelihood of deportation, despite the fact that his guilty plea to an aggravated felony triggered mandatory deportation under federal law. The defendant is permitted to move to vacate his plea if he can demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have chosen differently had he been properly informed about the consequences.</s>"}

On February 14, 1991, he was sentenced as promised. In 2010, the defendant was convicted of another felony, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Shortly after his arrest for that felony, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit of the United States Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against the defendant on the ground that his 1991 conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was a deportable offense. In those proceedings, the defendant conceded removability based on the 1991 conviction, but sought discretionary relief from deportation. The United States Immigration Court denied the defendant\u2019s application, and directed that the defendant be deported. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order.\nThereafter, the defendant moved to vacate his 1991 conviction on the ground that he was deprived of the right to effective assistance of counsel, alleging that his attorney failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea, as required by Padilla v Kentucky (559 US 356 [2010]). The County Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, without a hearing, holding that Padilla did not apply retroactively and, in any event, the defendant failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s alleged failure to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea. By decision and order dated September 11, 2012, a Justice of this Court granted the defendant leave to appeal from the County Court\u2019s order.\nIn Chaidez v United States (568 US \u2014, 133 S Ct 1103 [2013]), the United States Supreme Court held that the rule stated in Padilla does not apply retroactively to persons whose convictions became final before Padilla was decided. Although the defendant argues, pursuant to Danforth v Minnesota (552 US 264, 282 [2008]), that this Court should give broader retroactive effect to the Padilla rule than required under Teague v Lane (489 US 288 [1989]), we have declined to do so (see People v Soodoo, 109 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2013]; People v Andrews, 108 AD3d 727 [2013]).\nHere, without the benefit of the Padilla rule, the alleged failure of the defendant\u2019s attorney to advise him of the possibility that he might be deported as a result of his plea does not constitute deficient performance under the United States or New York Constitutions. At the time that the defendant entered his plea of guilty in 1990, defense counsel\u2019s performance was governed by the rule that \u201cthe failure of counsel to warn [a] defendant of the possibility of deportation\u201d did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Vargas, 112 AD3d 979 [2013]; People v Soodoo, 109 AD3d at 1015; cf.

Finally, it has been held that a person\u2019s drug problem does not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in one\u2019s sentence (see, People v Honsinger, 162 AB2d 877, 878, lv denied 76 NY2d 894; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, Iv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nMikoll, J.

He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges and waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a prison term of 3 to 9 years to run consecutive to a 2 to 6 year prison term imposed by the Albany County Court in connection with other charges.\nOn appeal, defendant does not challenge the legality of the sentence, but argues that it is excessive because it was made to run consecutive, instead of concurrent, to the sentence imposed by the Albany County Court. Defendant, however, is precluded from raising this claim inasmuch as it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]).

Thereafter, the defendant and the People completed a plea bargain. As part of the plea bargain, the People agreed that (1) based on the plea, the range of sentence would be from \"a minimum of three to life, to a maximum of eight and a third to life\u201d and (2) they would recommend a sentence of three years to life if the \u201csubjective determination\u201d of the State Police was that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations.\nPrior to sentencing, New York State Police Investigator Duffy, with whom the defendant was working, prepared a \"list of activities\u201d that the defendant had engaged in, \u201cacting as a cooperating individual with the N.Y.S.P.\u201d\nAt sentencing, the defendant\u2019s counsel alerted the court that he had spoken to Duffy and was advised by the latter that the defendant had cooperated \"two hundred percent\u201d with the State Police. In opposition, the People argued that (1) the promise of three years to life was conditioned on the State Police being satisfied that the defendant actually delivered those \"quality dealers that he claimed he could deliver\u201d and (2) the defendant had not so delivered. The sentencing court accepted the People\u2019s version of the plea bargain, and sentenced the defendant to a term of five years to life.\nWe disagree with the sentencing court\u2019s determination. The on-the-record plea bargain indicates that a sentence of three years to life would be imposed upon the defendant if the State Police, in their subjective determination, were of the view that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations. There is nothing on the plea bargain record which obligated the defendant to deliver so-called \"quality dealers\u201d or actually produce controlled buys and sales resulting in arrests. Nevertheless, the record is insufficient to determine whether the State Police, in their subjective determination, were of the view that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence must be vacated and a hearing on this issue conducted (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 239; Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57; People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340). After a resolution of this issue, the defendant should be appropriately resentenced. Mangano, J. P., Weinstein, Hooper and Balletta, JJ., concur.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered May 5, 2005, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, without a hearing.\nIn October 2002, defendant was convicted of robbery in the third degree. He was adjudicated a youthful offender and was sentenced to six months in jail with five years of probation. While on probation, he was charged with, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. He pleaded guilty to this crime and was sentenced to lVs to 4 years in prison. Shortly thereafter, he pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation. His probation was revoked and he was resentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years to run consecutive to the prison term imposed for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 2Vs to 7 years. Defendant thereafter moved, among other things, to set aside the sentence as illegal. County Court denied the motion and this Court granted him permission to appeal.\nDefendant asserts that inasmuch as he was adjudicated a youthful offender, County Court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence upon resentencing is illegal because it results in an aggregate sentence which exceeds four years. We disagree and affirm. In a felony case, when youthful offender status is granted, a sentence in excess of four years is not authorized (see CPL 720.20 [1] [a]; Penal Law \u00a7 60.02 [2]; \u00a7 70.00 [2] [e]). Thus, a defendant may not be sentenced as a youthful offender to two consecutive four-year terms (see People v Richard P., 12 AD3d 382 [2004]; People v Lucci, 193 AD2d 623 [1993]; People v David \u201cH\u201d, 70 AD2d 205 [1979]), even if those convictions occurred in different counties (see People v Vincent Z., 82 AD2d 165 [1981]). Moreover, if the only New York conviction is one in which a de fendant is sentenced to an indeterminate term of 1 to 3 years as a youthful offender, that sentence may not be imposed consecutively with an existing out-of-state determinate term of seven years (see People v Ralph W.C., 21 AD3d 904 [2005]). Here, defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, these cases are inapposite. Defendant\u2019s second New York conviction was as an adult. Because defendant is being sentenced for a violation of his youthful offender probation, there is no prohibition against running his youthful offender probation violation sentence consecutively to the sentence imposed upon his conviction as an adult (see People v Van Hoesen, 213 AD2d 944 [1995], lv denied 85 NY2d 981 [1995]; see also People v Simmons, 188 AD2d 668 [1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 893 [1993]).\nMercure, J.E, Peters, Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

[/INST] The County Court of Albany County denied the defendant's motion to set aside his sentence for criminal possession of a controlled substance, which was part of a series of convictions and probation violations.

Sentencing was deferred, however, to allow defendant to participate in a Drug Court program. After defendant twice failed to appear at Drug Court, she was sentenced to a prison term of V-k to 4V2 years. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we note that, insofar as defendant waived her right to appeal and failed to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, her challenge to the voluntariness of her guilty plea is not preserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Lasher, 14 AD3d 943, 943-944 [2005]). As there is nothing in the record which casts significant doubt on her guilt, no exception to the preservation rule applies (see People v Rich, 10 AD3d 739, 740 [2004]; People v Keyes, 300 AD2d 909, 909-910 [2002]).\nDefendant\u2019s appellate counsel asserts that, since defendant was a crack cocaine user, she may have been too intoxicated to form the requisite intent to sell. Failure to advise defendant of this possible intoxication defense is thus the basis for both the claim that defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel and that her plea was not knowing and voluntary. Not only is this argument based on sheer speculation, it is belied by the record. In a thorough plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant, among other things, that by pleading guilty she waived any affirmative defenses and defendant clearly admitted\u2014by repeating the question before answering it\u2014that she possessed cocaine with the intent to sell it.

The defendant further purports to appeal from an order of the same court, dated December 23, 1977, which denied his motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside his sentence. We deem the defendant\u2019s brief to include a motion to reargue a previous order of this court, dated May 9, 1978, which denied his application for leave to appeal from the order of December 23, 1977. Judgment affirmed. No opinion. Motion for reargument granted and, upon reargument, order dated May 9, 1978 vacated and leave to appeal from the order of December 23, \u00cd977, is granted by Presiding Justice Mollen. Order reversed, on the law, motion granted, defendant\u2019s sentence vacated, and case remitted to the County Court for resentencing consistent herewith. Upon his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth and sixth degrees, the defendant was adjudged a second felony offender and was sentenced accordingly. His second felony offender status was predicated upon a criminal prosecution in Texas. In that case, the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of marihuana. Instead of imposing a term of imprisonment, however, the court suspended sentence and placed the defendant on probation pursuant to section 3 of article 42.12 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. That statute provides: \u201cThe judges of the courts of the State of Texas having original jurisdiction of criminal actions, when it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public as well as the defendant will be subserved thereby, shall have the power, after conviction or a plea of guilty for any crime or offense, where the maximum punishment assessed against the defendant does not exceed ten years imprisonment, to suspend the imposition of the sentence and may place the defendant on probation or impose a fine applicable to the offense committed and also place the defendant on probation as hereinafter provided. In all cases where the punishment is assessed by the Court it may fix the period of probation without regard to the term of punishment assessed, but in no event may the period of probation be greater than 10 years or less than the minimum prescribed for the offense for which the defendant was convicted. Any such person placed on probation, whether in a trial by jury or before the court, shall be under the supervision of such court.\u201d Subsequent to the imposition of sentence in the case at bar, the defendant successfully applied to the Texas courts for relief pursuant to section 7 of article 42.12 of the Texas Code, which provides: \u201cAt any time, after the defendant has satisfactorily completed one-third of the original probationary period or two years of probation, whichever is the lesser, the period of probation may be reduced or terminated by the court. Upon the satisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of probation, and the expiration of the period of probation, the court, by order duly entered, shall amend or modify the original sentence imposed, if necessary, to conform to the probation period and shall discharge the defendant. In case the defendant has been convicted or has entered a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere, and the court has discharged the defendant hereunder, such court may set aside the verdict or permit the defendant to withdraw his plea, and shall dismiss the accusation, complaint, information or indictment against such defendant, who shall thereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of which he has been convicted or to which he has pleaded guilty, except that proof of his said conviction or plea of guilty shall be made known to the court should the defendant again be convicted of any criminal offense.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) As a result, the defendant\u2019s guilty plea in the Texas case was withdrawn and the indictment against him was dismissed. He then moved, pursuant to CPL 440.20, to vacate his sentence in the case at bar and to be resentenced as a first felony offender. The County Court denied his application (see People v Willis, 93 Misc 2d 657). We reverse. The defendant here did not merely receive a suspended sentence. (Cf. Penal Law, \u00a7 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [iii].) His guilty plea was withdrawn and the indictment against him was dismissed. By operation of Texas law, he was thereby released \u201cfrom all penalties and disabilities resulting from the * * * crime * * * to which he * * * pleaded guilty.\u201d Although the Texas statute permits the fact of the guilty plea to be made known to the court in the event the defendant is again convicted of a criminal offense, Texas courts have held that the statute bars the use of the plea for purposes of mandatory enhancement of punishment upon a subsequent conviction. (See Matter of Murchison, 560 SW2d 654 [Tex].) In view of the interpretation given by the State of Texas to its own statute, we hold that, upon the withdrawal of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and the dismissal of the indictment against him, he reverted to the status of a first felony offender. (See People v Bell, 82 Misc 2d 1021; cf. People v Slepinski, 54 AD2d 202.) Accordingly, his sentence must be vacated and the case remitted for appropriate resentence. (Cf.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCasey, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered May 26, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nOn May 5, 1989, defendant, through his counsel, offered to plead guilty to the two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance alleged in the indictment. County Court explained the rights defendant would relinquish by the plea, defined the crime as encompassing the sale of cocaine, and agreed that the court had previously committed itself to a sentence of not more than 5 to 10 years but that defense counsel could seek a more lenient sentence. Defendant then admitted that he was approached by a person named Ridley to \"get some drugs for him\u201d and agreed to do so for $60. Defendant also admitted that on November 10, 1988 at about 12:30 a.m., at the State Street entrance to Bliss Towers in the City of Hudson, Columbia County, he obtained the cocaine, turned it over to Ridley and received $40, but \"had to bring the money back\u201d. This last phrase is not explained or amplified. Defendant then entered a plea of guilty to the first count of the indictment. The plea allocution also reveals that about 10:00 p.m. on that same day at the same location, defendant stated that he was again approached by Ridley who \"wanted to buy drugs\u201d. Ridley specifically stated that he wanted four vials of crack, which defendant obtained. According to defendant, he sold \"those to Mr. Ridley\u201d for what defendant remembers to be $60. Defendant then entered a plea of guilty to the second count of the indictment. County Court mentioned that defendant had a prior felony offense within recent years and ordered a presentence report from the Department of Probation. At the sentencing hearing, defendant moved to withdraw his prior plea and requested a trial as soon as possible. The reasons given were ineffective assistance of counsel and defendant\u2019s misunderstanding of what his sentence would be. The District Attorney\u2019s objection to this motion was sustained and the court proceeded to sentence defendant as a second felony offender after defendant admitted the prior felony. The District Attorney recommended a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. Defense counsel recommended the minimum sentence permitted. The court imposed the minimum sentence of 4 Vi to 9 years in prison on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.\nOn this appeal, defendant urges that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea for the reason, advanced here for the first time, that he acted as agent of the buyer and was not a seller. In our opinion, the facts recited above are unambiguous and do not accommodate to defendant\u2019s contention that he was acting as the agent of the buyer. The possibility of such an agency relationship should not now inure to defendant\u2019s benefit when it was not raised in County Court and when he received the minimum sentence allowable to him as a prior felony offender. The facts recited in the allocution were adequate to sustain the plea. In his own words, defendant admitted to two sales, one for $40 and the second for $60. The allocution indicates that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights and entered his plea (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9). A defendant who accepts such a bargained for plea forfeits his right to challenge the factual basis for the plea (see, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97, 108; People v Clairborne, 29 NY2d 950, 951). Defendant received more than the benefit of his plea bargain in the minimum sentence imposed.

P., Casey, Mikoll and Levine, JJ., concur. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, following his guilty plea. The defendant's request to withdraw his plea, based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and misunderstanding of his sentence, was denied as he had voluntarily admitted to the sales during the plea allocution. The court found no merit in the defendant's argument that he acted as an agent of the buyer, noting that he received the minimum sentence as a prior felony offender and that the facts supported his plea.</s>"}

He was promised a sentence of two to four years imprisonment, \"concurrent with the time you are now serving\u201d. On February 14, 1994, he received the promised sentence.\nBy letter dated April 4,1994, the Department of Correctional Services informed the sentencing court that the sentence was illegal under Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 (2-a). On June 13,1994, the defendant appeared before the sentencing court, who informed him that \"we imposed an illegal sentence\u201d, and gave the defendant the option of being resentenced to two to four years imprisonment to run consecutive to his prior sentence, or withdrawing his plea and going to trial. The defendant did not object to that procedure and chose to withdraw his guilty plea.\nOn this appeal from the judgment of conviction rendered after trial, the defendant contends that the court improperly vacated his guilty plea. His contentions are unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, the court\u2019s power to correct an illegal sentence within one year after the sentence was imposed is well recognized in statutory and case law (see, People v Wright, 56 NY2d 613; People v Ford, 143 AD2d 522; People v Smith, 164 Misc 2d 306; CPL 440.40 [1]; cf., People v Riggins, 164 AD2d 797). In the instant case, where the defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive a sentence which the court and the parties later ascertained was illegal, the court was obligated to give the defendant the option to withdraw his plea as an alternative to imposing a legal sentence (see, People v Ford, supra). That the defendant chose an option which ultimately proved disadvantageous to him is not a ground for reversal.\nThe defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective cannot be determined on this record (see, e.g., People v Langhorne, 177 AD2d 713). Mangano, P. J., Ritter, Hart and McGinity, JJ., concur.

The appeal also raised claims of ineffective counsel, but these could not be assessed based on the available record.</s>"}

The County Court promised the defendant a sentence consisting of a determinate 21/2-year term of imprisonment plus a two-year period of post-release supervision on the conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (hereinafter the controlled substance conviction), and a concurrent indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years on the conviction of burglary in the third degree (hereinafter the burglary conviction). The court advised the defendant, inter alia, that if he failed to appear for sentencing, he would be sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment of eight years on the controlled substance conviction, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on the burglary conviction, but it did not advise the defendant that the postrelease supervision component of the sentence would be enhanced. After the defendant failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing and was returned on a warrant, the County Court imposed the determinate term of imprisonment of eight years plus a three-year period of post-release supervision with respect to the controlled substance conviction, and an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years with respect to the burglary conviction, to run consecutively.\nIn exchange for his pleas of guilty, the defendant was promised that his sentence on the controlled substance conviction would consist of a 2V2-year term of imprisonment plus a two-year period of postrelease supervision, and that if he failed to appear for sentencing, the imprisonment component of the sentence would be increased to eight years, and would run consecutively to the sentence imposed on the burglary conviction. Since, in addition to the promised enhancements, the postrelease supervision component of that sentence was increased from two years to three years, the defendant did not receive the bargained-for sentence.\nAccordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on the controlled substance conviction, as well as the inextricably intertwined sentence imposed on the burglary conviction, and remit the matter to the County Court, Suffolk County, to allow the County Court to (1) impose the promised sentences, which, in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to appear for sentencing, consist of a determinate term of imprisonment of eight years, plus a two-year period of postrelease supervision on the controlled substance conviction, and an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years on the burglary conviction, to run consecutively, (2) afford the defendant the opportunity to accept the previously-imposed sentences, including the enhanced period of postrelease supervision, or, (3) in the absence of either of those results, permit the defendant to withdraw his pleas of guilty (see People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Rossetti, 55 AD3d 637 [2008]; People v Kegel, 55 AD3d 625 [2008]; People v Rubendall, 4 AD3d 13, 20 [2004]).

County Court sentenced him pursuant to the plea agreement to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7\u00bd years, with three years of postrelease supervision. Following defendant\u2019s appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence on the ground that County Court had inadvertently failed to pronounce sentence on each of the two counts (People v Volfson, 69 AD3d 1123, 1125 [2010]). Thereafter, County Court resentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years on the forgery count and Ph years in prison on the criminal possession of marihuana count, to be followed by three years postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant contends that County Court erred in not ordering a CPL article 730 competency hearing prior to resentencing him. We disagree. It is well established that \u201c[a] defendant is presumed to be competent and is not entitled, as a matter of law, to a competency hearing unless the court has reasonable grounds to believe that, because of mental disease or defect, the defendant is incapable of assisting in his or her own defense or of understanding the proceedings against him [or her]\u201d (People v Planty, 238 AD2d 806, 807 [1997], lv denied 89 NY2d 1098 [1997]). Here, the record reveals that defense counsel informed County Court prior to the resentencing hearing that, in her opinion, defendant was unfit to proceed and requested that the court order a competency hearing, but then counsel withdrew the request at the hearing. Further, while defendant\u2019s statements during the resentencing hearing were argumentative and disruptive, they were not, in our view, indicative of a mental impairment requiring a competency hearing (see People v Kulakov, 72 AD3d 1271, 1272 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 775 [2010]; People v Daley, 302 AD2d 745, 746 [2003]).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nSpain, J.\nAppeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered November 30, 2010, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, after a hearing.\nPursuant to a negotiated plea agreement and in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, defendant, a citizen of Guyana with permanent resident status in the United States, pleaded guilty in 2005 to the reduced crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony. He was sentenced to the agreed-upon term of six months in jail and five years of probation. He did not appeal that judgment. In 2010, after removal (i.e., deportation) proceedings were commenced against him reportedly based upon this 2005 conviction and a 2002 drug-related misdemeanor, defendant \u2014 aided by counsel \u2014 moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his 2005 judgment of conviction. Defendant contended that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because his trial counsel had ineffectively represented him by misinforming him that he would not be subject to removal as a consequence of that guilty plea. After a hearing at which defendant and his trial counsel testified, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant now appeals.\nIt is not disputed that as a resident alien, defendant\u2019s conviction, upon his guilty plea, to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree rendered him subject to deporta tion (see 8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]; People v Reynoso, 88 AD3d 1162, 1163 [2011]; see also People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 954 [2012]; People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]). In Padilla v Kentucky (559 US \u2014, \u2014 n 1, \u2014, 130 S Ct 1473, 1477 n 1, 1483 [2010]), the United States Supreme Court held that federal immigration laws governing deportation of resident aliens convicted of drug-related offenses are clear and explicit, making removal \u201cpresumptively mandatory,\u201d and that trial counsel\u2019s representation is constitutionally deficient if he or she fails to accurately advise or misadvises a defendant, prior to entering a guilty plea, of the deportation consequences of that plea (see Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 686, 688 [1984]).\nTo meet his burden of proving that he was deprived of meaningful representation related to his guilty plea, defendant was required to establish both \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense\u201d (id. at 687; see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 113-114). At the hearing, defendant testified that he had been concerned about and discussed with counsel the immigration consequences of a guilty plea to the drug sale offense in the plea offer. While defendant admitted being aware at the time of this plea that a felony drug-related conviction subjected him to removal, which he learned during a prior plea to a reduced drug-related misdemeanor, he testified that counsel advised bim not to worry regarding the immigration consequences of this plea because he was a \u201csmall fish\u201d and federal authorities have \u201cbigger fishes to fry.\u201d Defendant claimed he would not have accepted the plea offer if he knew that it would result in his removal.\nCounsel testified that, although he could not recall his specific conversations with defendant, he was aware that defendant was not a citizen in 2005 and his general practice, as relevant here, is to advise all noncitizens that deportation is a possible consequence of any drug-related conviction. He also testified that, in his experience, the likelihood of removal proceedings being pursued by federal authorities may be diminished when a plea is to a reduced lower level felony, as here, or is served in local jail rather than state prison, and he may have shared that opinion with defendant. In denying defendant\u2019s motion, County Court expressly credited counsel\u2019s testimony \u2014 which contradicted that of defendant \u2014 that he would not have told defendant that he would not be deported as a result of the subject guilty plea, and we accord great deference to that credibility assessment (see People v Bodah, 67 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 838 [2010]).\nBecause defendant was advised that removal was a possible consequence of his guilty plea, and was not misinformed to the contrary, he did not establish that counsel failed to fulfill his obligations on this issue or that his advice was deficient so as to satisfy the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US at \u2014, 130 S Ct at 1482-1483; People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 114-115; People v Diallo, 88 AD3d 1152, 1152-1153 [2011]). The fact that counsel, in advising defendant to accept the favorable plea deal, may have expressed his experience-based assessment of the likelihood that removal proceedings might or might not be initiated depending upon different factors was not misleading and did not undermine counsel\u2019s accurate preplea advisement to defendant that the drug sale plea offer is a removable offense for a noncitizen (see People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d at 1029). As defendant did not establish that he was deprived of meaningful representation or any other ground to vacate the judgment of conviction, County Court properly denied his CPL 440.10 motion.\nMercure, J.E, Stein, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed.\n. Those papers are not in the record on appeal.\n. We need not decide whether Padilla is to be applied retroactively to defendant\u2019s collateral attack premised upon counsel\u2019s alleged affirmative misadvice (see People v Pepper, 53 NY2d 213, 220-221 [1981], cert denied 454 US 967 [1981]). At the time of defendant\u2019s 2005 plea, the New York Court of Appeals had established that counsel\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation to a noncitizen regarding the deportation consequences of a contemplated guilty plea constituted deficient performance as required to establish the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109 [2003]). [/INST] The appellate court upheld the County Court's denial of the defendant's motion to vacate his 2005 conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance, highlighting that the defendant was adequately advised about the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Although the defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel due to misinformation about deportation, the court credited the trial counsel's testimony that he had informed the defendant of the possibility of deportation, thus concluding that the defendant did not prove he was deprived of meaningful representation. The order is affirmed.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered May 22, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He received an indeterminate sentence with a maximum term of life imprisonment and a minimum term of imprisonment of four years. On this appeal defendant raises two issues. He maintains that the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the illegal sale of methadone constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and, consequently, subdivision 2 of section 70.00 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional. Secondly, he contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance to enable defendant\u2019s attorney to further prepare for trial was an abuse of discretion. As for the first issue, most of the arguments urged by defendant for reversal were rejected in People v Venable (37 NY2d 100, affg 46 AD2d 73). Furthermore, we are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s additional argument that since methadone, unlike heroin, produces no euphoria or high and is less dangerous, its illegal sale should not receive the same punishment as the illegal sale of heroin. The reasons advanced by defendant to sustain his second contention also lack merit. The record demonstrates that defendant\u2019s counsel had approximately two weeks\u2019 notice that the trial would commence on April 15, 1974; that counsel had the desired transcript of a codefendant\u2019s trial some three days before trial; that the testimony of the unavailable witness was admittedly cumulative and, in any event, defendant made no effort to take his testimony. From an examination of the record in its entirety, we conclude that defendant had a fair trial and we should not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P. J., Sweeney, Kane, Main and Larkin, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was affirmed. The defendant raised two main issues: the constitutionality of a mandatory life sentence for selling methadone, which he argued was cruel and unusual punishment, and an alleged abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying a continuance for his attorney to prepare. Both arguments were rejected, as the court found that the defendant had a fair trial and that his claims lacked merit.</s>"}

Defendant appeals contending that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was under a psychiatrist\u2019s care and taking tranquilizers and, at a minimum, an examination pursuant to CPL article 730 should have been conducted. He further contends that under these circumstances, he was also denied the effective assistance of counsel. Alternatively, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. Initially, defendant\u2019s failure to move either to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes our review of his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea or the effectiveness of the assistance provided by counsel (see, People v Coppaway, 281 AD2d 754; People v Beekman, 280 AD2d 784, Iv denied 96 NY2d 780; People v Millis, 266 AD2d 581, lv denied 94 NY2d 826). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that defendant entered into a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and was not denied the effective assistance of counsel (see, People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617). Although defendant stated during the plea allocution that he saw a psychiatrist once every two weeks for sleeping problems and that he was taking prescription sleeping pills, County Court adequately inquired to determine that the medication did not impair defendant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings (see, id.).\nFinally, we do not find the sentence imposed \u2014 which is the maximum sentence authorized \u2014 to be harsh and excessive. County Court clearly and repeatedly indicated prior to accepting defendant\u2019s plea that it would not be bound to the joint recommendation of 2 to 4 years\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the minimum permitted sentence (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [2], [3]; People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852). Thus, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the sentence imposed (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).\nMercure, J.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered July 6, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nPrior to jury selection in the trial of an indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, defendant was arraigned on a new indictment charging him with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and defense counsel was permitted to view a videotape of the drug transaction which gave rise to the second indictment. After conferring with defense counsel, and based upon the assurance that he would be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of two years and 5 to 10 years, respectively, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the weapon possession charge and one count of the drug possession charge in satisfaction of both indictments. County Court thereafter denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea and sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon concurrent terms. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant argues that as a result of his statements during the allocution denying any knowledge that the gun was loaded, County Court erred in accepting his plea to the weapon possession charge. Assuming that defendant\u2019s argument has been preserved for our review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662), we disagree. To support a conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (4), it must be established that defendant knowingly possessed a loaded weapon (see, People v Ford, 66 NY2d 428, 440). Defendant admitted that he knowingly possessed a gun and that the gun was loaded, although he claims that he did not discover it was loaded until after he had given up possession of it. There is no requirement that defendant knew the weapon was loaded when he possessed it (see, People v Toribio, 216 AD2d 189, lv denied 87 NY2d 908; People v Casanas, 170 AD2d 257, lv denied 77 NY2d 959; People v Ansare, 96 AD2d 96).\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea, the record discloses that prior to accepting the plea, County Court advised defendant of the rights he would be waiving and defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights and was acting voluntarily with no coercion. Defendant freely admitted his guilt of the two crimes and, as a result of the plea bargain, was assured of concurrent sentences that were considerably less than the harshest possible consecutive sentences that could have been imposed. In these circumstances, defendant\u2019s conclusory claims of innocence, coercion and/or ineffective assistance of counsel, which remained unsubstantiated despite the ample opportunity afforded by County Court to defendant and his attorney on the motion, provided no basis to vacate the plea (see, People v Feliciano, 242 AD2d 787; People v Hudson, 237 AD2d 759, lv denied 90 NY2d 1012).\nCrew III, Peters, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. After County Court repeatedly adjourned further proceedings to allow defendant to seek new counsel and prepare a motion to withdraw his plea, it denied said motion and sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of IV2 to 3 years in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that his counsel was ineffective because, by failing to prepare for trial, he left defendant with no choice but to enter an involuntary guilty plea. Our review of the plea minutes, in which defendant unequivocally recited the facts of his crime and assured County Court that he had spoken to his counsel, was satisfied with his services and was entering the plea of his own free will and with a full understanding of its consequences, belies this contention. Moreover, the record reveals that defendant\u2019s attorneys were active in defendant\u2019s case and procured for him an advantageous plea agreement which reduced his sentencing exposure. Accordingly, we perceive no basis for concluding that defendant did not receive meaningful representation (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Lewis, 13 AD3d 810, 811 [2004]). Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments in his pro se submission concerning, among other things, the propriety of the traffic stop and the severity of his sentence, have been forfeited by his knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal and we decline to review them under the circumstances (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 586, 633 [2003]).\nMercure, J.P., Crew III, Peters and Kane, JJ., concur.

On the day scheduled for trial, with a panel of prospective jurors present and ready for jury selection, defendant entered a counseled plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally possessing a hypodermic instrument. Pursuant to North Carolina v Alford (400 US 25) and People v Serrano (15 NY2d 304), in order to avoid the risk of conviction after trial and the greater sentence that could be expected as a result, defendant entered the plea despite his protestation of innocence and with the express understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 6 years, the sentence actually imposed.\nWe are not persuaded that defendant\u2019s statements of dissatisfaction with his assigned counsel, apparently the third to represent him, or the People\u2019s assertion that, with time served, defendant was already eligible for parole rendered the plea involuntary or unknowing. Although the People agreed that they would not oppose parole, no representation was made that defendant would be immediately released. In fact, County Court specifically instructed defendant that his eligibility for parole did not necessarily mean that the Parole Board would release him. Finally, County Court was not required to accede to defendant\u2019s last-minute insistence that he would proceed to trial only with assigned counsel from outside Sullivan County (see, People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, 841, lv denied 79 NY2d 949; People v Bray, 170 AD2d 722, 723).\nWeiss, P.

The defendant had entered the plea to avoid the risk of a harsher sentence after trial, despite expressing dissatisfaction with his counsel and maintaining his innocence. The court found that the plea was valid and the defendant's eligibility for parole did not guarantee immediate release, thus the judgment was upheld.</s>"}

Defendant also admitted violating a previously imposed condition of probation. She waived her right to appeal in writing and orally during the plea colloquy. As agreed, she was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of two years for the criminal sale conviction and four years for the attempted criminal sale conviction, along with periods of postrelease supervision. With regard to the probation violation, her probation was revoked and she was sentenced to time served. This appeal ensued.\nDefendant, as limited by her brief, challenges only her conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Specifically, defendant contends that her plea of guilty to that crime was involuntary. While this claim survives defendant\u2019s appeal waiver (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]), defendant never moved to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and, thus, this contention has not been preserved for our review (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Sebast, 32 AD3d 615, 615 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 870 [2006]). Nevertheless, considering the claim, we find it to be without merit. Review of the plea proceedings demonstrates that defendant was fully apprised of her rights and the consequences of her plea, which she acknowledged she understood and she freely admitted the underlying facts of the crime and pleaded guilty to its commission. Further, there is nothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s conclusory and self-serving assertions, raised now for the first time, that she was discouraged from taking her case to trial and led to believe that she had no alternative but to plead guilty (see People v Missimer, 32 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2006]). Accordingly, we find that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Jones, 30 AD3d 633, 633 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the agreed-upon four-year prison sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded in light of her valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).\nCardona, EJ., Carpinello, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

[/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, concluding that her guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, despite her claims that it was involuntary.

The appeal was deemed unpreserved for review as the defendant had not moved to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment.</s>"}

He was subsequently sentenced, as agreed, to a prison term of 37a to 7 years. Defendant now appeals, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. Although defendant expressly waived his right to appeal, his challenge to the effectiveness of counsel implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, thus, survives such waiver. Defendant, however, did not preserve that issue, having failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]). In any event, his claim is without merit. \u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995] [citations omitted]; see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Here, counsel negotiated a favorable plea agreement exposing defendant to far less prison time than if he were convicted of the pending charges after trial and there is no indication in the record that counsel was otherwise ineffective (see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Washington, supra at 742). Finally, due to defendant\u2019s knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review his contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Travis, 12 AD3d 784 [2004]).\nCarpinello, Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea under a negotiated agreement that included a sentence of 37a to 7 years in prison. The defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that his sentence was harsh were rejected, as he did not preserve the issue by moving to withdraw his plea, and the court found no merit in his claims, noting that he received a favorable plea deal. Consequently, the court upheld the judgment without reviewing the sentence due to the defendant's voluntary plea and waiver of appeal rights.</s>"}

The sentence, which falls within the statutory guidelines, was the agreed-upon result of a plea bargain, pursuant to which a second charge against defendant was dropped.

County Court fully advised defendant of the terms of the plea bargain and the consequences of the plea, including that he was waiving his right to appeal. He acknowledged his acceptance of the plea and his understanding that he was waiving his right to appeal (see, People v Li Castro, 179 AD2d 890, lv denied 79 NY2d 1003; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039). Thus, the waiver is fully enforceable and precludes appellate review (see, People v Marziale, 182 AD2d 1035, lv denied 80 NY2d 835).\nDefendant further argues that the waiver was invalid because he was pressured to accept the plea bargain based on the Trial Judge\u2019s refusal to recuse himself. He claims that he was forced to either accept the plea or face a trial before that Judge. This claim is in essence a challenge to the voluntariness of the plea itself. There is, however, no evidence that the plea was coerced. Defendant acknowledged that he had enough time to consider the terms of the plea, that he had consulted with his attorney and that he had not been pressured. Sufficient inquiry was made by County Court to defendant and thus the plea itself was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made (see, People v Ross, 182 AD2d 1022, appeal dismissed 80 NY2d 934).\nDefendant also claims that the waiver of his right to appeal did not include a waiver of his right to challenge whether the sentence was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Under the circumstances of this case, defendant\u2019s waiver extended to a waiver of his right to challenge his sentence. He negotiated for the sentence and it was promised to him as part of the plea agreement (see, People v Burk, 181 AD2d 74, lv denied 80 NY2d 927; see also, People v Moissett, 154 AD2d 786, affd 76 NY2d 909). In any event, the sentence of 5 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment was well within the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2], [3]), was in accordance with the plea bargain and was in full satisfaction of a 30-count indictment. We therefore can find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).\nMikoll, J.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, he was sentenced on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as a persistent violent felony offender to the minimum permissible prison term of 12 years to life. On the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, he was sentenced to a prison term of 12 years, plus three years of postrelease supervision. County Court directed that the sentences were to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]). Based upon our review of the record, we agree. If defendant\u2014who entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea\u2014had been sentenced on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree alone, a challenge to the severity of that sentence would not be wholly frivolous because he received more than the minimum with respect to that charge and did not waive his right to appeal (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d at 635-636; cf. People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]). Here, however, such a challenge would be futile because defendant will be imprisoned for at least 12 years on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.08 [2], [3] [c]), followed by parole supervision for the rest of his life (see Executive Law \u00a7 259-i [2] [b]). Thus, were his concurrent sentence to be reduced, he would spend no less time in prison or under postrelease supervision (see People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 554 n 1 [2006]).

Appellate counsel sought to be relieved, stating there were no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, and the court agreed, finding that any challenge to the sentence would be futile since the defendant would serve a minimum of 12 years for the weapon charge regardless.

After defendant\u2019s original sentence was vacated by this Court (293 AD2d 916), County Court resentenced him to an indeterminate prison term of five years to life.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCrew III, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), entered January 4, 1990, (1) convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and (2) which revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.\nA two-count indictment was filed on August 30, 1989 charging defendant, in each count, with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On December 4, 1989, defendant appeared in County Court and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. She was advised at that time by the court that the District Attorney would recommend at sentencing that she receive a prison sentence of 3 Vi to 7 years, to which her assigned counsel agreed. Defendant acknowledged that she understood that such would be the recommendation. It was also agreed that she would plead guilty to a violation of probation charge and that the sentence on that plea would run concurrently. On the day of sentencing, in accordance with CPL 400.21 (2), the People filed a statement alleging that defendant was the subject of a predicate felony conviction. County Court then inquired of defendant if it was a fact that she had previously been convicted of a felony on March 24, 1989 and she admitted that she had. She was then sentenced to the agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 3 Vi to 7 years. She was also sentenced to a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years on the probation violation. On this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in failing to advise her that she was subject to mandatory sentencing as a second felony offender. We agree.\nInitially, we observe that defendant failed to preserve the issue in question by not moving to withdraw her plea or to vacate her judgment of conviction. However, since the procedure challenged is on the face of the record, we will review the matter in the interest of justice (see, People v Di Paola, 143 AD2d 487).\nA review of the record fails to demonstrate that defendant knew or was informed that she was subject to second felony offender treatment and was thereby subject to a mandatory prison sentence (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06). At the time the plea was taken, the sentence to be imposed on the drug charge was described only as a recommendation. Having been convicted by plea on prior occasions and, in each instance, sentenced to probation, defendant may have erroneously assumed, albeit unrealistically, that County Court might once again sentence her to probation or something substantially less than the recommendation. This case is in contrast to People v Harris (61 NY2d 9), where the defendant not only admitted his previous felony conviction but also acknowledged that he was subject to sentencing as a second felony offender, and People v Bouyea (64 NY2d 1140), where the defendant was apprised of and admitted the essence of his prior felony conviction at the time of his plea and raised no challenge to the court\u2019s consideration of the prior conviction then or at the time of sentencing a month later.\nWhile the courts have not developed any catechistic mandate with regard to a plea allocution, it is incumbent upon a trial court to ascertain that a plea is knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338). Such considera tions encompass the proposition that the defendant understands the possible penal sanctions to which he or she is subject (see, People v Woods, 50 AD2d 720). With that in mind, we believe that County Court, in the case at bar, should have been alerted to the fact that the recommended sentence was the result of second felony offender status and should have advised defendant that she would thereby be subject to mandatory imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of at least three years in order to ensure that her plea was voluntary in the sense that she understood the penal sanctions to which she was subject by reason of that conviction (see, People v Topping, 74 AD2d 703; People v Woods, supra). At the very least, given that the second felony offender statement was filed on the very day of sentencing, we believe that defendant should have been advised of her right to controvert the statement in accordance with CPL 400.21 (3) (see, People v Bryant, 47 AD2d 51). Accordingly, the conviction must be reversed and defendant given the opportunity to apply to County Court to withdraw her plea or to controvert the predicate conviction if she so chooses and is able. This applies as well to the violation of probation charge.\nWeiss, P. J., Mikoll and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, indictment and violation of probation charge reinstated and matter remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this court\u2019s decision. [/INST] The court reversed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance and revoking her probation, determining that she was not properly informed of her status as a second felony offender, which would have subjected her to mandatory sentencing. Although the defendant did not preserve the issue for appeal, the court chose to review it in the interest of justice, concluding that she did not understand the potential penalties associated with her plea. The case has been remanded to the County Court for further proceedings, allowing the defendant an opportunity to withdraw her plea or contest the prior felony conviction.</s>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nEgan Jr., J.\nAppeal from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered January 11, 2016, which denied defendant\u2019s motion for a conditional order pursuant to CPL 160.58 sealing her criminal record, without a hearing.\nIn 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class E felony, in satisfaction of accusatory instruments charging her with multiple drug-related crimes. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant agreed to participate in the Albany County Drug Treatment Court program and, if successful, would be permitted to withdraw her felony guilty plea and plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Defendant successfully completed the program and, in 2010, withdrew her original plea and entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a class A misdemeanor. In 2015, defendant moved for a conditional order pursuant to CPL 160.58 sealing the record pertaining to her conviction. The People did not oppose the motion, but County Court denied it without conducting a hearing. Defendant now appeals.\nCPL 160.58, which was enacted as part of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2009 (L 2009, ch 56, \u00a7 1, part AAA, \u00a7 3), provides that criminal defendants who have been convicted of specified offenses, have successfully completed certain drug treatment programs and have served the sentences imposed for such offenses are eligible to have the record of their offenses conditionally sealed (see CPL 160.58 [1]; Peter Preiser, 2009 Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 160.58, 2017 Supp Pamph at 177-178). The decision of whether to grant an application to conditionally seal a criminal record is within the discretion of the sentencing court (see Peter Preiser, 2009 Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 160.58, 2017 Supp Pamph at 178). Notably, CPL 160.58 (3) provides that, in making such determinations, \u201cthe court shall consider any relevant factors, including but not limited to: (i) the circumstances and seriousness of the offense or offenses that resulted in the conviction or convictions; (ii) the character of the defendant, including his or her completion of [a] judicially sanctioned treatment program . . . ; (iii) the defendant\u2019s criminal history; and (iv) the impact of sealing the defendant\u2019s records upon his or her rehabilitation and his or her successful and productive reentry and reintegration into society, and on public safety\u201d (emphasis added).\nIn denying defendant\u2019s motion, County Court relied upon the absence of a provision in the plea agreement indicating that defendant\u2019s criminal record would be conditionally sealed. However, given that defendant\u2019s plea agreement was entered into prior to the enactment of the statute, it could not have included a provision addressing the conditional sealing of her criminal record, and the absence of such a provision is not dis-positive. Significantly, CPL 160.58 has been held to be applicable to convictions preceding its enactment (see People v M.E., 121 AD3d 157, 160-161 [2014]). Therefore, County Court should have reviewed defendant\u2019s motion in light of the factors set forth in CPL 160.58 (3).\nThat said, under the particular circumstances presented and given that the record in this matter is complete, we shall consider the motion applying the relevant statutory criteria, rather than remitting this matter to County Court for that purpose. The record establishes that defendant\u2019s misdemeanor conviction is her sole criminal offense, she has not been arrested since 2008, she has successfully completed the drug court program (thereby avoiding incarceration), she has obtained a college degree and maintained gainful employment and she continues to participate in Narcotics Anonymous. Further, although defendant has received a certificate of relief from civil disabilities, her criminal record is likely to be an impediment to both the furtherance of her career and her future employment prospects. In view of the foregoing, and given that the People now concur with the relief requested by defendant, her motion should be granted and the record of her criminal conviction conditionally sealed pursuant to CPL 160.58.\nPeters, P.J., McCarthy, Devine and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the order is reversed, on the law, without costs, defendant\u2019s motion to conditionally seal the record of her criminal conviction granted, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for compliance with CPL 160.58 (5).\nWe note that, inasmuch as a motion to conditionally seal a criminal record is a civil matter, this appeal is properly before us pursuant to CPLR 5701 (a) (2) (v) (see People v M.E., 121 AD3d 157, 159 [2014]). [/INST] The appellate court reversed the County Court's denial of the defendant's motion to conditionally seal her criminal record under CPL 160.58, which allows for the sealing of records for individuals who have successfully completed drug treatment programs. The court found that the County Court had incorrectly relied on the absence of a sealing provision in the defendant's plea agreement, as the statute applies retroactively. Given the defendant's completion of the treatment program, lack of subsequent arrests, and positive contributions to society, the court granted her motion to seal her record and remitted the matter for compliance with the statute.</s>"}

Pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty as charged and agreed to enter a drug treatment program which, among other things, prohibited her unauthorized use or possession of drugs. Defendant was informed at this time that noncompliance with the program could lead to sanctions, including termination from the program and a sentence of up to 2\u2153 to 7 years in prison, and she was thereafter sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge. After defendant was found with a large amount of prescription drugs in her possession and admitted to a relapse, County Court summarily revoked her conditional discharge and resentenced her to 2 to 6 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, inasmuch as defendant did not contest County Court\u2019s finding that she violated the conditional discharge and was afforded the opportunity to be heard on the violation, no formal hearing was required before her conditional discharge was revoked (see CPL 410.70 [1]; People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]).

His current argument that his guilty plea was involuntary was preserved by his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his plea and survives his valid appeal waiver (see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2012]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2011]); however, it is without merit. The record reveals that defendant unequivocally acknowledged that he understood the consequences of pleading guilty and, by his affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s inquiries, freely admitted committing the crime to which he was pleading guilty (see People v Davis, 84 AD3d 1645, 1646 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 815 [2011]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d at 1343). Furthermore, while defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective representation survives his appeal waiver to the extent that such representation might have affected the voluntariness of his plea, defendant\u2019s argument that counsel pressured him during certain conversations to accept the plea offer involves matters outside the record and is thus more properly raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v DeJesus, 96 AD3d 1295, 1295-1296 [2012]; People v Pendelton, 81 AD3d 1037, 1038-1039 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 898 [2011]). In all other respects, the record reflects that defendant received meaningful representation, culminating in a very favorable plea bargain (see People v Shurock, 83 AD3d at 1344; People v Chaney, 70 AD3d 1251, 1252-1253 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 748 [2010]).\nLahtinen, J.E, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Having failed either to move to withdraw his plea on this ground prior to the imposition of sentence or to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, the defendant has not preserved, for appellate review the plea allocution\u2019s sufficiency (see CPL 470.05, subd 2; People v Hoke, 62 NY2d 1022; People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Mattocks, 100 AD2d 944). Moreover, were we to review this issue in the interest of justice, vacatur would not be required because the allocution satisfied the requirements of People v Harris (61 NY2d 9).\nWith regard to the defendant\u2019s contention that the second felony offender statute (see Penal Law, \u00a7 70.06) is unconstitutional, we note that this issue, too, has not been preserved for our review (see People v Cates, 104 AD2d 895). In any event, this identical issue has previously been rejected (see People v Thompson, 105 AD2d 762; People v Rembert, 105 AD2d 717; People v Vasquez, 104 AD2d 1012; People v Cates, supra), and no reason to depart from these rulings has been proffered to us by the defendant. Similarly any claim that the sentence imposed is disproportionate to the crimes for which the defendant stands convicted must be rejected under the circumstances presented herein (see United States v Ortiz, 742 F2d 712).\nFinally, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The defendant received the bargained-for sentence (see People v La Lande, 104 AD2d 1052; People v Nelson, 104 AD2d 1055; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816), which was the minimum allowed by law (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.06, subd 3, par [b]; subd 4, par [b]).

He argued that his guilty pleas should be vacated due to not being informed of his rights, but failed to preserve this claim for appellate review and the court found his plea allocution sufficient. Additionally, his challenges regarding the constitutionality of the second felony offender statute and the proportionality of his sentence were rejected, as these issues had been previously determined and his sentence was deemed appropriate and within legal limits.</s>"}

After considering the submissions tendered by defendant and the People, County Court denied defendant\u2019s application. Thereafter, in full satisfaction of both indictments, as well as a probation violation, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and, further, admitted violating the terms of his probation. Defendant then was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon aggregate prison term of 44/2 years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nDefendant\u2019s sole argument upon appeal is that County Court abused its discretion in denying his application for participation in the judicial diversion program. To the extent that defendant did not abandon this issue by failing to request a hearing in this regard (see CPL 216.05 [3] [a]), we nonetheless find defendant\u2019s argument to be lacking in merit. \u201cCourts are afforded great deference in making judicial diversion determinations\u201d (People v Williams, 105 AD3d 1428, 1428 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1021 [2013] [citations omitted]; see People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; see also Matter of Carty v Hall, 92 AD3d 1191, 1192 [2012]).

Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to enter a drug treatment program. The agreement provided that, if defendant successfully completed the program, she would be permitted to withdraw her plea, plead guilty to forgery in the third degree and receive three years of probation. If she did not, she would be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison upon her original plea of guilty to forgery in the second degree.

She now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record characterized by numerous drug-related offenses and was given ample opportunity to undergo treatment to address her drug problem, all to no avail. In view of this, and given that the sentence imposed was specifically agreed to by defendant as part of the plea agreement, the sentence is not harsh and excessive (see People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 927 [1996]; see also People v Wilson, 219 AD2d 758 [1995], lv denied 86 NY2d 875 [1995]).

She eventually agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all pending charges, waive her right to appeal and be sentenced to a prison term of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court refused to accept that agreement and pointed out that its terms were more favorable to defendant than prior plea offers, notwithstanding her continued refusal to admit her identity and concomitant questions regarding the accuracy of her criminal record. Defendant then pleaded guilty to the entire indictment \u2014 namely, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree \u2014 and the separate superior court information was dismissed upon consent (see CPL 220.60 [1]). County Court sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of eight years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, and she now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant first contends that County Court abused its discretion by refusing to approve the plea agreement reached between her and the People. Inasmuch as \u201cthis issue is neither jurisdictional nor of a constitutional dimension, [her] right to appellate review of this issue was forfeited by [her] subsequent plea of guilty\u201d (People v Brooks-Singh, 47 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2008]; see Missouri v Frye, 566 US \u2014, \u2014, 132 S Ct 1399, 1410 [2012]; People v Van Dyne, 12 AD3d 120, 124 [2004]; cf.

However, while the sentence was greater than the one contemplated by the prior plea agreement, the record reflects that it stemmed from appropriate sentencing factors such as defendant\u2019s lack of remorse and her known prior criminal history (see People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 411-412 [1980]; People v Seymore, 106 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1045 [2013]; People v Merck, 63 AD3d 1374, 1376 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 861 [2009]).

In 1973 he petitioned the Wyoming County Court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that his sentence was improper because he was not first given a drug addiction examination pursuant to the provisions of former section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law. His petition was dismissed on the ground that former section 207 only requires an addiction examination if the defendant states or indicates that he is an addict or if symptoms or other appearances of addiction are present.

In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2\u00bd to 5 years in prison.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to make a statutory speedy trial motion to dismiss the charges based upon the more than six-month delay between the filing of the criminal complaints and his arraignment. Inasmuch as the claimed ineffectiveness is not alleged to have impeded the voluntariness of his plea, it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lane 1 AD3d 801, 803 [2003]; People v Bier, 307 AD2d 649, 650 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]).

Following unsuccessful motions to suppress physical evidence and statements defendant made to police officers following his arrest, the matter came on for trial. During jury selection, defendant entered into a plea bargain, under the terms of which he entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal, including his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motions, with the express understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of eight years to life. Subsequently, although expressly acquiescing in his plea and the negotiated sentence, defendant moved to vacate the waiver of appeal upon the ground that there had been numerous violations of his constitutional rights that he should be permitted to raise on appeal. County Court denied the motion. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm.

Our review of the plea minutes establishes that defendant clearly understood that he was waiving his right to appeal, including his right to challenge the denial of his suppression motions, as a condition of the negotiated plea and that he willingly accepted all of the terms of the plea bargain.

Initially, we note that a recommendation by a probation department with respect to sentencing is not binding on the court, especially where, as here, defendant was on probation when she committed the crime for which she now stands convicted (see, People v Arogundy, 112 AD2d 1003, 1004, lv denied 66 NY2d 761). Given her admission that the substantial amount of crack that she possessed was exclusively hers, defendant received an advantageous plea agreement, which included the prosecution\u2019s agreement that her plea and sentence of 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment would satisfy any violation of probation charge.

He was duly arraigned and counsel assigned. On June 4,1970 the court, in the presence of the defendant and counsel, directed an investigation to determine appellant\u2019s eligibility for treatment as a youthful offender, and on June 19, 1970 the court determined appellant was eligible for such treatment following the necessary consent by appellant and his counsel. A plea of not guilty was then entered and the matter adjourned for trial. On the return date appellant failed to appear, nor did he appear on a subsequent trial date. On February 4, 1971 the court on its own motion revoked and rescinded appellant\u2019s eligibility for youthful offender treatment, directed that the indictment be unsealed and appellant be treated as an adult. An order was entered to this effect and, on March 18, 1971, a further order was entered revoking bail and issuing a bench warrant. Approximately a year later appellant returned to the jurisdiction and pled guilty to the second count of the indictment in full satisfaction thereof. On March 27, 1972 he was sentenced to a reformatory term and committed to the Elmira Reception Center. On this appeal appellant contends (1) that the court lacks the power to revoke youthful offender eligibility once it is granted, (2) it abused its discretion when it failed to grant youthful offender treatment and (3) the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. The court originally determined that appellant was \u201c eligible \u201d for youthful offender treatment under the provisions of section 913-g of the former 'Code of Criminal Procedure.

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to six months in jail. Defendant thereafter moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion, after a hearing, and defendant now appeals with permission from this Court.\nDefendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal precludes him from asserting ineffective assistance of counsel except to the extent that it may have impacted the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Smith, 301 AD2d 671, 673 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 658 [2003]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 633 [2003]; People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, 800 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 717 [1993]). In this regard, defendant claims that counsel failed to advise him that his guilty plea could result in his deportation to Jamaica. Although counsel\u2019s affirmative misrepresentations regarding deportation or other consequences of a plea may constitute ineffective assistance under certain circumstances, it is well established that counsel\u2019s failure to apprise a defendant of the possibility of deportation\u2014 \u201can act of omission\u201d\u2014does not by itself establish ineffective assistance (People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 18 [2002], affd 1 NY3d 109 [2003]; see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404-405 [1995]).

[/INST] The County Court of Warren County denied the defendant's motion to vacate his conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance, which he claimed was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically regarding not being informed of potential deportation consequences of his guilty plea.

He was arraigned before a Justice of the local criminal court of an adjoining town due to the unavailability of the Justice of the appropriate town court to whom the felony complaint and all other pertinent documents were transferred for further preliminary proceedings. However, the complaint and related documents were not received and no further proceedings transpired in the local criminal court.

Thereafter, in accordance with a negotiated plea, defendant pleaded guilty to a violation of Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 (12), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 Vs to 10 years. This appeal ensued.\nWe reverse.

He pleaded guilty to all of the charges contained in the indictment in satisfaction thereof. County Court advised defendant of the possible sentences that could be imposed, including that such sentences could run consecutive to one another and that he could receive longer sentences due to his prior felony conviction, but made no promises with respect to sentencing. In imposing sentence, County Court determined that the last four counts of the indictment would run concurrent to one another but consecutive to the first two counts and sentenced defendant to a total of 10 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Despite defense counsel\u2019s request, County Court declined to direct that defendant participate in the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program during his incarceration. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive and that he should have been directed to participate in the CASAT program. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant exhibited a pattern of drug-related activity as is evidenced by the offenses charged in the indictment as well as his criminal record. In addition, no promises were made by County Court with respect to sentencing and defendant actually received a much lesser sentence than he could have if convicted after trial. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v McDonald, 43 AD3d 1207 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 867 [2008]; People v Reynoso, 11 AD3d 719, 720 [2004]; People v Davis, 4 AD3d 567, 568 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 798 [2004]).

As a second felony offender, defendant received the most lenient allowable sentence of 4!\u00e1 to 9 years for a class B felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06). Because of his prior felony conviction, defendant\u2019s sentence must run consecutively with the unexpired portion of the prior term (Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2-b]).

Furthermore, defendant\u2019s plea bargain was favorable. He could have received as much as 12 Vi to 25 years on each of the three counts of the indictment if he had been convicted after trial, with all sentences to run consecutively.

In accordance with this agreement, the court promised to sentence defendant to a term of six years\u2019 to life imprisonment. In entering the plea, the defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [1]). Thereafter, the court imposed a sentence of six years to life in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.\nWe modify the judgment of conviction, in the interest of justice, by reducing it to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, an A-II felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement. Since the sentence imposed upon the defendant\u2019s plea was the sentence promised, there is no purpose to be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence (see, People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743).\nWe find that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel since defense counsel\u2019s mistaken belief that attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree is an A-II felony does not rise to the level of ineffectiveness (see, People v Baldi, 54 AD2d 137).\nWe have examined the remaining issues raised by the defendant and find them to be either unpreserved for,appellate review or without merit (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nMulvey, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered July 31, 2013, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (four counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts).\nFollowing an investigation by the Attorney General\u2019s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant was arrested in connection with an alleged conspiracy to possess and sell cocaine and heroin in Albany County, other counties in New York and Vermont. He was charged by two indictments with multiple crimes related to the possession and sale of narcotics. Following a joint jury trial, defendant was convicted of four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (counts 2, 3, 5 and 32), one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (count 6) and five counts of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28). He was sentenced as a second violent felony offender to an aggregate prison term of 87 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues that the guilty verdict with regard to counts 2, 3 and 5 for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was against the weight of the evidence. Upon our independent weight of the evidence review, we first determine whether a different finding would not have been unreasonable and, if not, we \u201cmust weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions\u201d (People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348 [2007]; accord People v Wynn, 149 AD3d 1252, 1254 [2017]; see People v Reeves, 124 AD3d 1068, 1068 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1076 [2015]). \u201cIssues of credibility and the weight to accord testimony are matters to be resolved by the trier of fact, who is free to accept or reject any part of the testimony presented\u201d (People v Lancaster, 143 AD3d 1046, 1047 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 1147 [2017]; see People v Crooks, 129 AD3d 1207, 1208 [2015], affd 27 NY3d 609 [2016]; People v Lanier, 130 AD3d 1310, 1311 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1009 [2015]).\nSeveral police officers testified to three controlled buy operations involving defendant in March, April and September 2011. James Wood, a detective with the City of Albany Police Department, testified that he directed a confidential informant (hereinafter Cl) to call defendant to arrange the purchase of $1,000 worth of crack cocaine on each of the three separate occasions, and the conversations were recorded. Wood \u2014 who was familiar with defendant and his voice from prior interactions \u2014 listened in on the calls and identified defendant\u2019s voice on the recordings. Before and after each meeting, Wood searched the Cl for contraband and money. On all three dates, defendant met the Cl at the designated location and, under the supervision of several police officers, the Cl briefly entered defendant\u2019s vehicle, purchased the crack cocaine and then returned to his own vehicle and drove back to police custody. During two of the transactions, other officers, serving as the \u201ceyes\u201d of the operation, identified defendant as the seller. Moreover, during each transaction, the Cl wore a body wire and, despite the poor audio quality of the recordings, Wood was able to identify defendant\u2019s voice on the recordings and translated the coded drug sale language employed. Following each transaction, the Cl returned with a plastic bag containing crack cocaine weighing more than one-half ounce. Viewing all of the evidence in a neutral light, weighing the conflicting testimony and according deference to the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, we find that, even if a different verdict would not have been unreasonable, the weight of the evidence fully supports the challenged convictions (see People v Heard, 92 AD3d 1142, 1143-1144 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 994 [2012]; People v Morris, 25 AD3d 915, 916-918 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 851 [2006]).\nFurthermore, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s untimely request for a missing witness charge (see People v Carr, 14 NY3d 808, 809 [2010]). A request for such a charge \u201cmust be raised as soon as practicable so that the court can appropriately exercise its discretion and the parties can tailor their trial strategy to avoid substantial possibilities of surprise\u201d (People v Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424, 428 [1986] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; accord People v Turner, 73 AD3d 1282, 1283 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 896 [2010]; see People v Carr, 14 NY3d at 809). Here, while the People listed the Cl as a potential witness in their pretrial discovery, the People did not call the Cl to testify during their chronological presentation of the proof early in this trial regarding the sales involving this Cl, which occurred some two months before the close of proof. Defendant was thus aware that the Cl would not testify at the conclusion of the People\u2019s case, but did not make this charge request until after the close of proof and, thus, the request was untimely (see People v Alexander, 127 AD3d 1429, 1433 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1197 [2015]; People v Turner, 73 AD3d at 1283-1284). Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s closing summation heavily emphasized the People\u2019s failure to call the Cl, despite calling CIs involved in purchases from the codefendants, effectively urging the jury to draw an adverse inference due to the failure to call the Cl (see People v Darby, 72 AD3d 1280, 1283 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 749 [2010]). This ameliorated any prejudice.\nDefendant also claims that County Court erred in delivering a supplemental instruction to the deliberating jury prior to a weekend recess without notice to and consultation with counsel, and that the instruction was coercive. We recently addressed and rejected a similar claim in a decision upholding the convictions of codefendant Guy Anderson (People v Anderson, 149 AD3d 1407, 1415-1416 [2017]). We add that defendant\u2019s reliance on CPL 310.30 is misplaced, inasmuch as the instructions before the recess to which defendant objects were not in response to a jury note or inquiry (see CPL 310.10 [2]; compare People v O\u2019Rama, 78 NY2d 270, 276-277 [1991]; People v Morrison, 148 AD3d 1707, 1708 [2017]). Defendant raises no specific criticisms regarding the instruction beyond a general claim that it was improperly coercive, which we reject, having previously concluded that the charge given \u201c \u2018was balanced and neutral in tone, and . . . did not urge any dissenting jurors to abandon their convictions and acquiesce in the opinion of the other jurors, attempt to coerce or compel the jurors to reach a particular verdict, or shame the jurors into reaching a verdict\u2019 \u201d (People v Anderson, 149 AD3d at 1415, quoting People v Cole man, 64 AD3d 787, 787 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 835 [2009]; see People v Vazquez, 145 AD3d 1268, 1270-1271 [2016]). We also note that, although not conclusive, the jury continued to deliberate and acquitted defendant on two counts and was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count, further undermining any contention that the court\u2019s instruction coerced a verdict (see People v Anderson, 116 AD3d 499, 500-501 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 958 [2014]; compare People v Aponte, 2 NY3d 304, 309 [2004]).\nDefendant also argues that a litany of trial errors deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to discharge an alternate juror who admitted to having read news articles regarding the case is moot, since, as we have noted in a code-fendant\u2019s appeal, the potential juror did not participate in deliberations (see People v Anderson, 149 AD3d at 1414 n 3; People v Haardt, 129 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2015]; People v Rivera, 7 AD3d 358, 359 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 741 [2004]). Further, upon receiving a note alleging that members of the jury had fallen asleep during portions of the testimony, the court noted that it had not observed any of the jurors sleeping, but nevertheless issued an instruction for the jury to request breaks when necessary. As defendant did not object to this course of action, his claim of error is unpreserved for our review (see People v Blond, 96 AD3d 1149, 1152-1153 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1101 [2012]; People v Busreth, 35 AD3d 965, 967 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 920 [2007]).\nFinally, with regard to the sentence, we are persuaded that defendant\u2019s aggregate sentence of 87 years in prison, although legally permissible, should be reduced in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783 [1992]; People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 908 [2000]). Considering the circumstances of his crimes and his prior criminal history, we modify defendant\u2019s sentence by directing that the sentences for counts 2, 3, 5 and 32 run concurrently to each other, but consecutively to the other counts, and directing that the sentences for counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 run concurrently to each other, but consecutively to the other counts. Therefore, defendant\u2019s sentence will be an aggregate prison term of 32 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and determined to be lacking in merit.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that defendant\u2019s sentences for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree under counts 2, 3, 5 and 32 of the indictment shall run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the remaining sentences imposed, and that defendant\u2019s sentences for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 of the indictment shall run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the other sentences imposed, and, as so modified, affirmed.\n. Defendant was jointly tried with five codefendants. This Court recently handed down decisions with regard to codefendant Guy Anderson (People v Anderson, 149 AD3d 1407 [2017]) and codefendant Michael Williams (People v Williams, 150 AD3d 1315 [2017]).\n. The jury acquitted defendant on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy charge against defendant. In addition, County Court granted the People\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance. [/INST] The defendant was convicted of multiple drug-related offenses following a jury trial, including four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and five counts of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The court upheld the convictions, finding that the evidence supported the jury's verdict, and denied the defendant's requests for a missing witness charge and claims of trial errors. However, the court modified the defendant's sentence from 87 years to an aggregate of 32 years in prison, with five years of postrelease supervision, citing the interests of justice.</s>"}

Defendant waived his right to appeal and thereafter was sentenced, in accordance with such plea bargain, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant thereafter moved pursuant to CPL article 440 to vacate his judgment of conviction upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. That motion was denied and this appeal ensued.\nWe affirm. The crux of defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is that his assigned attorney advised him that he had no viable agency defense in view of the five separate sales asserted in the indictment and, further, that if defendant went to trial he was \u201calmost certain to lose,\u201d thereby subjecting himself to potential consecutive sentences. As aptly observed by County Court, counsel\u2019s advise was realistic, appropriate and, given the extremely favorable plea bargain, hardly ineffective (see e.g. People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 398).

Nevertheless, County Court did err in its sentencing of defendant. Defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was misdescribed by all parties as a class A-II felony and his sentence to a prison term of five years to life was made on that basis. However, the crime to which he pleaded guilty is actually an A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [1]), and a prison term of at least 15 years is mandated by statute (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3]'[a] [i]). Since the sentence was illegal, defendant was denied the benefit of his plea bargain and he is therefore entitled to vacatur of the sentence imposed and he should be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Dunnett, 157 AD2d 886, lv denied 76 NY2d 734; People v Beach, 152 AD2d 772).\nJudgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Weiss, Levine, Mercure and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The court affirmed the defendant's guilty plea for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance but found that the sentencing was erroneous, as the crime was misclassified as a class A-II felony rather than the correct class A-I felony. Consequently, the defendant's sentence of five years to life was illegal, leading to the decision to vacate the sentence and allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. The case was remitted to the County Court for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.</s>"}

The record reveals that his plea of guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, the court told the defendant that it would consider a sentence of five years\u2019 probation and six months in the county jail if, upon receiving his criminal history, that sentence was appropriate, The People thereafter served a predicate felony statement which reflected two prior convictions in Massachusetts of \"[a]ssault and battery [by means of a] dangerous weapon\u201d (Mass Annot Laws ch 265, \u00a7 15A). When the defendant appeared for sentencing, the court informed him that as a second felony offender, the minimum sentence the court could legally impose was 3 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment, and offered the defendant leave to withdraw the plea. The defendant accepted the offer.\nUpon learning of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and believing that it could not legally impose the proposed sentence, the court properly afforded him the opportunity to withdraw his plea and thereby restore himself to the position he was in before the plea was taken. The court was required to do no more (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227; People v Hofmann, 151 AD2d 604). Having failed to challenge the second felony offender statement, the defendant cannot now be heard to argue that he erroneously relied upon it in withdrawing his plea. In any event, given the defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history, even if, as he maintains, the two convictions listed in the statement do not constitute predicate felonies under New York law, it does not necessarily follow that the court would have imposed the proposed sentence of probation and six months\u2019 incarceration (see, People v Selikoff, supra).\nWe have examined the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find that they do not warrant reversal of his conviction or a reduction in his sentence.

First, the recommendation in a presentence report is not binding on the sentencing court (see, People v Semkus, 122 AD2d 287, 288, lv denied 68 NY2d 1004). In addition, although County Court informed defendant at the time of his plea that it would not sentence him to anything harsher than 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment, it never made any promises to defendant with respect to any sentence of probation. In fact, the court specifically told defense counsel that defendant should not expect a prison sentence less than 1 to 3 years. Furthermore, even though the court could have sentenced defendant to a definite rather than an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, some term of imprisonment was still mandated (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [4]).

At the plea hearing, County Court ordered defendant released on bail but advised him that his failure to appear for sentencing would void the plea agreement, thereby exposing him to a possible enhanced sentence of up to 8V3 to 25 years in prison. When defendant failed to appear at the scheduled sentencing hearing, a bench warrant was issued which led to his arrest several months later. Upon defendant\u2019s return, County Court sentenced him to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. Defendant\u2019s appeal was held in abeyance and new counsel assigned after this Court determined that there were nonfrivolous appealable issues to be raised (279 AD2d 798).\nDefendant now appeals solely contending that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice, given that this conviction is his first offense.

The plea satisfied a two-count indictment, which stemmed from the execution of a search warrant and discovery of cocaine in defendant\u2019s possession. Defendant admitted his predicate felony conviction and County Court, as agreed, imposed a prison sentence of six years with three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal ensued.\nAs a threshold matter, we find that defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see also People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Jackson, 129 AD3d 1342, 1342 [2015]). The record reflects that County Court adequately explained the right to appeal and that it was separate and distinct from the other rights automatically forfeited by defendant\u2019s guilty plea, as well as the rights that were not forfeited by the appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Rubio, 133 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2015]). Defendant also executed a detailed written waiver in open court that described the scope of the rights being waived and acknowledged that he had sufficient time to discuss it with counsel, after County Court confirmed that he understood the written waiver of appeal and was freely and voluntarily signing it (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; see also People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 266-267 [2011]; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015]). Given defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver, his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is foreclosed (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d at 1038).\nDefendant further contends that County Court erred when it refused his request, made for the first time at sentencing, for a sentence of parole supervision that included drug treatment, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (3) (d) (see CPL 410.91). However, defendant received the sentence promised by the plea agreement\u2014a six-year prison sentence with postrelease supervision\u2014and that agreement did not include any promise by County Court to consider or recommend drug treatment as an alternative, discretionary sentence (see People v Brady, 122 AD3d 1009, 1010 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1160 [2015]; People v Patterson, 119 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1046 [2014]).

Thereafter, in July 2006, defendant \u2014 in full satisfaction of the foregoing indictment \u2014 pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and, in September 2006, was sentenced to the agreed-upon term of 10 years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Four years later, defendant filed a pro se CPL article 440 motion contending, among other things, that his sentence had been illegally imposed based upon a misapprehension as to the aggregate weight required to sustain his conviction under Penal Law \u00a7 220.18. The People did not oppose this request and, in May 2011, County Court granted defendant\u2019s motion, vacated the plea and sentence and scheduled the matter for further proceedings. Defendant appeared before County Court on May 25, 2011, at which time he was assigned counsel and the matter was adjourned to afford counsel an opportunity to review defendant\u2019s file.\nIn June 2011, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree \u2014 again in full satisfaction of the underlying indictment \u2014 in exchange for a prison term of seven years (subject to credit for time served) followed by two years of postrelease supervision. During the course of the plea colloquy, an extensive discussion was had with regard to whether defendant had a prior, valid felony conviction. Ultimately, the People agreed to treat defendant as a first felony offender, and no prior felony statement was filed. When defendant returned for sentencing in August 2011, he indicated that he wished to proceed pro se. Following a colloquy with defendant and assigned counsel, County Court granted defendant\u2019s request and thereafter sentenced him to the agreed-upon prison term. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nDefendant initially contends that the underlying indictment was jurisdictionally defective due to errors in the indictment number itself and in the list of charges contained on the indictment backer. \u201cAlthough . . . a jurisdictional defect in an indictment is not waived by a guilty plea and may be raised for the first time on appeal!,] . . . not every defect in an indictment is a jurisdictional defect for these purposes. In essence, an indictment is jurisdictionally defective only if it does not effectively charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime\u201d (People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978] [citations omitted]; see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1023 [2013]). Here, there is no question that the subject indictment, which incorporated by reference the statutory provisions applicable to the crimes charged therein, was sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d at 1023-1024; People v Brown, 75 AD3d 655, 656 [2010]), and the typographical errors of which defendant now complains \u201cconstitute . . . technical, nonjurisdictional defect[s] that [were] waived by defendant\u2019s guilty plea\u201d (People v Olmstead, 111 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2013]; see People v Porath, 104 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1019 [2013]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]).\nAs for the arguments made by defendant in his pro se brief, defendant cannot challenge County Court\u2019s decision granting his CPL article 440 motion and vacating his 2006 plea and sentence because, having successfully obtained the very relief he sought, defendant is not an aggrieved party within the meaning of CPLR 5511 (see generally People v Baker, 131 AD2d 491, 491-492 [1987], lv denied 70 NY2d 709 [1987]). With respect to defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant\u2019s present contentions \u2014 that counsel failed to properly investigate his case and provided inadequate or erroneous advice \u2014 implicate matters outside of the record and, as such, are more appropriately addressed in the context of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]; People v Alnutt, 107 AD3d 1139, 1144-1145 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014]). To the extent that the balance of defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea, such claim is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Horton, 140 AD3d 1525, 1525 [2016]; People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]). \u201cFurther, the narrow exception to the preservation rule was not triggered here, as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt\u201d (People v Perkins, 140 AD3d 1401, 1403 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).\nNor are we persuaded that County Court erred in granting defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se at the time of sentencing. \u201cA criminal defendant may be permitted to proceed pro se if the request is timely and unequivocal, there has been a know ing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, and defendant has not engaged in conduct that would interfere with a fair and orderly [proceeding]\u201d (People v Hamilton, 133 AD3d 1090, 1093 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Brooks, 140 AD3d 1780, 1781 [2016]). When faced with such a request, County Court must \u201cengage[ ] in the requisite inquiry, examining defendant\u2019s education, occupation, previous exposure to legal procedures and other relevant factors bearing on a competent, intelligent, voluntary waiver\u201d (People v Hamilton, 133 AD3d at 1093 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Brooks, 140 AD3d at 1781). Here, defendant made a timely and unequivocal request to proceed pro se, in response to which County Court questioned defendant as to his legal knowledge and experience and inquired as to whether defendant was aware of the risks that self-representation might entail; defendant, in turn, reiterated his desire to proceed pro se. In addition to the information gleaned during the colloquy with defendant, County Court was aware that, despite a lack of formal education or training, defendant had prevailed on his pro se motion to vacate his prior conviction and sentence. Under these circumstances, we have no quarrel with County Court\u2019s decision to permit defendant to proceed pro se at the time of sentencing.\nAs a final matter, defendant argues that his already-completed sentence should be vacated due to the People\u2019s failure to file a prior felony statement pursuant to CPL 400.21. During the course of the plea colloquy, County Court inquired as to whether the instant offense was defendant\u2019s second felony offense. Defense counsel acknowledged that defendant had a prior felony conviction, but indicated that defendant was asserting \u201cthat the prior conviction cannot count as a predicate for this case because the original sentence was illegal.\u201d Upon further inquiry by County Court, defendant clarified that he was contending that the plea underlying the prior conviction was \u201cunlawful,\u201d in response to which County Court indicated that it would afford defense counsel time to explore and resolve the issue of whether defendant was in fact a predicate felon. Following additional discussion, the People \u2014 reasoning that defendant\u2019s felony offender status would not affect the previously agreed-upon sentence one way or the other \u2014 indicated that they would not \u201cseek the prior felony\u201d and were content to have defendant sentenced as a first felony offender. Accordingly, no prior felony statement was filed, and defendant thereafter was sentenced both in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement and to a term of imprisonment consistent with the sentencing range applicable to a first felony offender.\nAssuming, without deciding, that the People\u2019s failure to file a prior felony statement (see CPL 400.21) has been preserved for our review (see People v Brown, 70 AD3d 1302, 1305 [2010], affd, 17 NY3d 742 [2011]; compare People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52 [2000], with People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636 [1983]), we find the People\u2019s omission in this regard to be harmless error and, further, that granting the pro se relief requested by defendant \u2014 vacating the sentence previously imposed and remitting for resentencing \u2014 would, under the particular facts of this case, \u201cbe futile and pointless\u201d (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; accord People v Fuentes, 140 AD3d 1656, 1657 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1072 [2016]; People v Leon, 23 AD3d 1110, 1112 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 755 [2005]; People v Dawson, 269 AD2d 867, 868 [2000]). As noted previously, defendant, who actually benefitted from the People\u2019s failure to comply with CPL 400.21 and, hence, suffered no prejudice as a result of this omission, has served his sentence, and his period of postrelease supervision has expired. Accordingly, remitting this matter for resentencing would serve no purpose other than to potentially expose defendant to an additional period of incarceration. Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.\nLynch, Rose, Clark and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\n. Defendant\u2019s 2006 guilty plea was premised upon his possession of two ounces of cocaine, but a 2004 amendment to Penal Law \u00a7 220.18 had increased the aggregate weight required for that crime from two ounces to four ounces (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 21).\n. County Court noted during the May 2011 appearance that, upon \u201ccalculat[ing] the conviction,\u201d it appeared that the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision no longer had a basis upon which to retain custody of defendant and, therefore, it was anticipated that custody of defendant would be transferred to the Ulster County Jail pending further proceedings.\n. Defendant finished serving this prison sentence and was released to parole supervision in November 2011, and his period of postrelease supervision expired in November 2013 (see Dept of Corrections and Community Supervision Inmate Population Information Search, http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/ GCA00P00/WIQ2/WIN Q120).\n. Although defendant filed his notice of appeal in September 2011, he did not perfect his appeal in this Court until March 2016. [/INST] Defendant appealed a judgment from Ulster County Court convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea. After initially pleading guilty in 2006 to a related charge, he successfully vacated that plea in 2011 and later accepted a new plea deal. The court found no jurisdictional defects in the indictment and ruled that the defendant was not aggrieved by the prior ruling that vacated his original plea, ultimately affirming the judgment and sentence.</s>"}

Defendant executed a written waiver of indictment and agreed to plead guilty as charged in exchange for which defendant was promised a prison term of no more than lVs to 4 years. Defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant at length of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and the consequences of a guilty plea and defendant replied that he understood. Defendant stated that he was guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, but denied knowing that it was cocaine that he had possessed. At this point, the proceeding was adjourned so that de fendant could confer with his attorney. Five days later, the plea proceeding resumed and defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to consult with his attorney and wanted to plead guilty and that no one was forcing him to do so. Defendant w\u00e1s sworn and answered the court\u2019s questions, admitted that he knew he possessed the requisite amount of cocaine, and signed a written appeal waiver. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to 1 to 3 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal and is also unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rogers, 15 AD3d 682 [2005]; People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]). Defendant made no statements during the final plea colloquy that negated an essential element of the crime or cast doubt upon his guilt and his responses to County Court\u2019s questions established the elements of the crime; therefore, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]; People v Kelly, supra at 789; see also People v Goodell, 13 AD3d 816, 817 [2004], lv denied 4 NY2d 831 [2005]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]).\nNext, to the extent that defendant\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel implicate the voluntariness of his plea, they survive the waiver of appeal (see People v Cabezas, 307 AD2d 594, 595 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]), but are likewise unpreserved and also belied by the record (see id. at 595; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]). The record does not support defendant\u2019s assertion that he was denied meaningful representation by counsel\u2019s failure to further investigate or pursue defenses, and instead evidences a favorable plea bargain (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Finally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentence is barred by his voluntary waiver of his right to appeal and we find no basis on this record to conclude that said waiver should not be honored (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).\nPeters, J.P., Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant made pretrial motions for various relief, hearings were conducted and the matter proceeded to trial. After the prosecution presented its case and defendant testified on his own behalf, a plea bargain was reached whereby defendant entered a plea of guilty to each count of the indictment with the understanding that the sentences to be imposed would not exceed an aggregate prison term of 5 to 15 years. At the time fixed for sentencing, defendant\u2019s attorney made an oral motion to withdraw defendant\u2019s guilty plea upon the grounds that defendant was not satisfied with the legal representation he received, that defendant entered the plea \"against his own judgment\u201d, and that defendant felt threatened or coerced into pleading guilty because of \"possible perjury charges which may have been brought\u201d against him. County Court denied the motion and proceeded to sentence defendant in accordance with the plea bargain to concurrent prison terms of 5 to 15 years. Defendant appeals, contending only that County Court erred in denying the motion to withdraw his plea of guilty without conducting a \"limited interrogation\u201d to determine the basis for the motion.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the Trial Judge, after ascertaining the prosecution\u2019s position on defendant\u2019s motion and then stating his own views on the matter, did give defendant an adequate opportunity to speak on his own behalf (see, People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927). Defendant declined to make a statement at that time (see, People v Oliver, 163 AD2d 686), did not raise the claim of ineffective counsel in a posttrial application (see, People v Ramos, 63 NY2d 640, 643; cf., People v Braun, 167 AD2d 164; People v Jones, 95 AD2d 869, 870), and even now gives no indication of the manner in which his legal representation is claimed to have been deficient. Moreover, based upon his participation in the pretrial motions, hearings and the trial of the indictment, as well as the lengthy plea proceeding, the Trial Judge could make his own assessment of the competence of defendant\u2019s attorney (see, People v Braun, supra) and the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s guilty plea (see, People v Adams, 151 AD2d 921, 922; see also, People v Ramos, supra, at 642-643; People v Jones, supra). Finally, based upon our own review of the record, we are in accord with County Court\u2019s determination that defendant was afforded meaningful representation and that his plea was voluntarily entered, particularly in view of the evidence of guilt adduced at trial and the fact that defendant has made no protestation of innocence (see, People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, 885, lv denied 75 NY2d 921; People v Jones, supra; cf., People v McKennion, 27 NY2d 671, 672-673).\nJudgment affirmed.

First, the plea agreement did not include any guarantee that defendant would be adjudicated a youthful offender. In addition, County Court could not adjudicate defendant a youthful offender and at the same time impose a prison sentence of 2 to 6 years (see, CPL 720.20 [3]; Penal Law \u00a7 60.02).

The charges arose out of defendant\u2019s sale of cocaine to a confidential police informant. Represented by counsel, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all six counts of the indictment and waived her right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 2Vs to 7 years. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant challenges the sufficiency of the plea allocution, contending that County Court failed to elicit an adequate factual recitation from her before accepting her plea. Initially, we note that while defendant\u2019s waiver of her right to appeal does not preclude this Court\u2019s review of the voluntariness of her plea, defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction generally precludes review of [her] challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution\u201d (People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635; see, People v Ward, 282 AD2d 871, 872). Defendant made no statements during the colloquy which were inconsistent with her guilt, which negated an essential element of the crime or called into question the voluntariness of her plea and, thus, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable in this case (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, supra at 636; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant\u2019s challenges to the adequacy of the allocution or the voluntariness of her plea, we would find they are without merit. A review of the colloquy between County Court and defendant demonstrates that both the plea and the waiver of appeal were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Martinez, 243 AD2d 923, 924; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769-770, lv denied 89 NY2d 919). At the plea colloquy, the court fully informed defendant of her rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty. Defendant stated that she understood the consequences of her plea and waiver and that she was not under the influence of drugs or medication. Defendant then admitted that she had knowingly and unlawfully attempted to sell cocaine on the date charged. Given these facts, we find no basis to vacate the guilty plea.\nLikewise, in light of defendant\u2019s knowing waiver of the right to appeal the sentence as part of her guilty plea, her challenge to the severity of the sentence is not preserved for our review (see, People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, lv denied 93 NY2d 968; People v McElhiney, 237 AD2d 827, 828, lv denied 90 NY2d 861). In any event, we are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, given defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, the nature of defendant\u2019s crime, that she received the negotiated sentence as part of a favorable plea bargain and that there are no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see, People v Mickens, 275 AD2d 818, 819; People v Chapman, 273 AD2d 495, lv denied 95 NY2d 904).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

He was initially arraigned on the basis of two felony complaints. At that time, defendant was not represented by counsel.\nOn September 30, 1983, defendant was indicted by the Grand Jury on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1]). Shortly thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

We reject both of those contentions.\nFollowing his indictment on the charges, defendant was represented by counsel from arraignment through sentencing. While defendant urges ineffectiveness on the part of his assigned counsel in not pursuing a defense theory of entrapment, there is no reason to conclude that such a tactic would have been successful. Where defense counsel reasonably can conclude that a pretrial procedure or defense tactic would be unavailing, counsel is not obliged to pursue it further (People v Peters, 90 AD2d 618, 619; see, People v Bramble, 103 AD2d 1019). The record of the colloquy between the court and defendant at the time defendant pleaded guilty establishes that he was fully advised of his rights and the consequences of his plea, and manifested his understanding of the nature and consequences of that act (People v Peters, supra, p 619). From the record before us, we are unable to find that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at any stage of the proceeding.\nOn the basis of defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and the plea bargain arrangement he agreed to, we find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of sentence by County Court, which was in compliance with the provisions of Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 (2) (c) and (3) (b).\nJudgment affirmed.

In accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of IV2 years followed by one year of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in that counsel failed to pursue pretrial discovery or motions and did not move to suppress the evidence against him. As the record does not reflect that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion, this claim was not preserved for our review (see People v Jenkins, 130 AD3d 1091, 1091 [2015]; People v Broomfield, 128 AD3d 1271, 1272 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1086 [2015]). Moreover, \u201c[i]n the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Sylvan, 108 AD3d 869, 870 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1091 [2014] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under settled law, the \u201c[f]ailure to request a suppression hearing or to make a pretrial motion does not, by itself, constitute ineffective assistance, particularly in the absence of any basis upon which to conclude that a defendant had a color-able claim or that counsel\u2019s actions were not premised upon a legitimate strategy\u201d (People v Vonneida, 130 AD3d 1322, 1322-1323 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1093 [Dec. 29, 2015]; see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Cooper, 126 AD3d 1046, 1047-1048 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 966 [2015]; cf.

Defendant assured County Court prior to the plea allocution that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel regarding the plea offer and that he was satisfied with counsel. Further, the record reflects that counsel secured a favorable plea deal and successfully argued against second felony offender sentencing. Thus, were the issue preserved, we would find that nothing in the record supports defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of meaningful representation (see People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712-714 [1998]; People v Cooper, 126 AD3d at 1048).\nGarry, Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.

Neverthe less, having negotiated a favorable plea bargain and entered his guilty plea with the clear understanding that he would be sentenced to a specific indeterminate prison term as a second felony offender, defendant had sufficient notice and opportunity to controvert the allegations in the second felony offender statement (see, id., at 739). When asked at sentencing whether defendant wanted to controvert anything in the statement, defense counsel advised Supreme Court that he had reviewed the statement with defendant and that there was no objection. In these circumstances, defendant waived any objection to the constitutionality of the predicate felony conviction and its use as the basis for the enhanced sentence (see, People v Wade, 260 AD2d 798, 799, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006, cert denied 528 US 1028; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850).\nIn any event, there is no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that a discrepancy between State and Federal law regarding the need for an overt act to support a conviction of conspiracy precludes the use of defendant\u2019s Federal conspiracy conviction as a predicate felony in New York. In determining whether a foreign crime is equivalent to a New York felony for the purposes of enhanced sentencing, the inquiry focuses upon a comparison of the elements of the foreign statute with the elements of the analogous Penal Law felony (see, People v Gonzalez, 61 NY2d 586, 589). Inasmuch as the Penal Law \u00a7 105.20 requirement of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy \u201cis an evidentiary requirement unrelated to the elements of the substantive crime\u201d (People v Rossney, 178 AD2d 765, 767, lv denied 79 NY2d 1007), the alleged discrepancy upon which defendant relies is irrelevant to the predicate felony issue.\nCardona, P.

[/INST] The court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, ruling that his challenge to the enhanced sentence as a second felony offender was waived due to his plea agreement.

Subsequently, on May 3, 1996, defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with robbery in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree for crimes committed while he was on probation. At the same time, defendant pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation. On June 17, 1996, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of five years on the charge of robbery and 5 to 10 years on the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance. On the same date, defendant\u2019s probation was revoked and he was resentenced to a concurrent prison term of 5 to 15 years for violating the terms of his probation. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s primary contention is that County Court erred in sentencing him as a second felony offender because on June 17, 1996, the date he was sentenced, he also was resentenced on the crimes for which he was serving a term of probation and, therefore, those crimes could not serve as predicate convictions for the purpose of sentencing him as a second felony offender. We disagree. We previously have held that \u201c[o]nce a sentence of probation is revoked, the new sentence takes its place (see, CPL 410.70 [5]) * * * [and] can properly form the basis for a predicate felony conviction\u201d (People v Knapp, 113 AD2d 154, 167, cert denied 479 US 844). Inasmuch as the crimes for which defendant was sentenced on October 16, 1995 may form the basis for a predicate felony conviction and, further, were final adjudications as of that date, we conclude that such crimes were properly considered by County Court in sentencing defendant as a second felony offender (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70,06 [1] [b] [ii]).\nIn view of this holding, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon counsel\u2019s failure to challenge defendant\u2019s sentencing as a second felony offender. Likewise, given defendant\u2019s criminal history and his commission of two crimes while on probation, we find no merit to his claim that the sentence imposed in connection with his viola tion of probation was harsh and excessive (see, People v Barrett, 221 AD2d 772, lv denied 87 NY2d 1017).\nMikoll, J.

The Court also dismissed claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and found the imposed sentence to be appropriate given the defendant's criminal history.</s>"}

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 -Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Kepner, J.), rendered June 8, 1981, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree. Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree after having sold marihuana to an undercover police officer on two separate occasions. The transactions were apparently arranged by defendant\u2019s brother-in-law. On the morning trial was to commence, defendant, who had earlier requested his counsel to initiate plea bargaining, pleaded guilty to the first of the two counts with the understanding that the second count would be dismissed and that he would be sentenced to a term of one and one-half to three years, the minimum available to him as a second felony offender. During the colloquy preceding his guilty plea, defendant fully and freely admitted engaging in the criminal transaction covered by the first count of the indictment. It appears further that he completely understood the ramifications of his plea and that he had discussed the circumstances of the case, including the specific possibility of asserting two mutually exclusive defenses, alibi and entrapment, with his assigned counsel, the Chemung County Public Defender. At sentencing, defendant, claiming entrapment, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. His motion was denied and sentencing was adjourned until the attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s office who had represented defendant at the plea proceeding could be present. At the adjourned sentencing hearing, the Public Defender again moved to withdraw the guilty plea and then, because of the attorney-client privilege and his participation in the plea negotiations, declined to comment further on the motion. Following the court\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s assertion that he possessed a valid entrapment defense, the bargained-for sentence was imposed. Defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, predicated as it is upon the fact that his attorney advised him to plead guilty when he allegedly had a strong entrapment defense, is meritless. Serious obstacles confronted the Public Defender had he attempted to advance this defense at trial. These included the inherent difficulty of proving entrapment, defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record, which undoubtedly would have been brought to light, and the formidable proof of guilt that two separate drug sales to the same police officer evidence. Moreover, a conviction after trial could have led to a maximum sentence of four to eight years. These circumstances suggest that defense counsel\u2019s urging defendant to accept the plea bargain represented sound defense strategy (People v Tomaselli, 7 NY2d 350, 355). It is also charged that the court erred in failing to conduct an in-depth inquiry into the factual basis for defendant\u2019s motion. When asked about the reason for withdrawing his guilty plea, defendant responded he was \u201cgoing under entrapment\u201d, that he had been \u201cset up\u201d. The sentencing Judge, who had questioned defendant at length when the plea was accepted and had heard defendant unequivocally declare his guilt and also specifically admit that he had discussed an entrapment defense with his attorney, was thoroughly justified in concluding that there was no substantive basis to the withdrawal motion (see People v Eagan, 90 AD2d 909; People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940). It is also noteworthy that defendant made no attempt to alter his admission of guilt at the sentencing hearings. Also lacking in conviction is the suggestion that error occurred when the sentencing court neglected to assign new defense counsel after the Public Defender chose not to comment on the merits of the motion because of the attorney-client privilege. The Public Defender did not take an adverse position to defendant at sentencing and actually made the withdrawal motion on defendant\u2019s request. Lack of further argument on counsel\u2019s part worked no discernible prejudice to defendant\u2019s case, and did not give rise to an adversity of interest necessitating the appointment of new counsel sua sponte (see People v Friedman, 39 NY2d 463, where appointment of new counsel was not required although defense counsel, facing similar circum stances, made statements which actually harmed the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea). Judgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appeal challenged the conviction of a defendant who pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sale of marihuana, following his admission of guilt during plea negotiations, which included the dismissal of a second count. The court rejected his motion to withdraw the plea based on an entrapment defense, finding his attorney's advice to accept the plea a sound strategy given the strong evidence against him and the risk of a longer sentence if convicted at trial. The judgment was affirmed, with the court concluding there was no substantive basis for the withdrawal motion and no need for new counsel.</s>"}

Thereafter, he entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he would plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waive his right to appeal and promise cooperation against his codefendants in exchange for a prison sentence of six years followed by three years of post-release supervision. Subsequent to his plea, the Organized Crime Task Force prosecuting the case informed County Court that defendant had failed to fulfill his obligation to cooperate under the plea agreement. Accordingly, the court found the agreement not to be enforceable and thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of 10 years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver; County Court adequately informed him that his right to appeal was separate from the other rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea, the written appeal waiver he executed in open court similarly informed him of that fact, and he was provided with ample time to confer with counsel to ensure that he fully understood the impact of his waiver (see People v Campbell, 114 AD3d 996, 997 [2014]; People v Osgood, 111 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1089 [2014]). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed by his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Osgood, 111 AD3d at 1030; People v Durham, 110 AD3d 1145, 1145 [2013]). While defendant\u2019s contention that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent survives his appeal waiver, it has not been preserved for our review, as the record before us does not indicate that he moved to withdraw his plea (see People v Monk, 113 AD3d 999, 1000 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable as defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that called into question either his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Brabham, 112 AD3d 1066, 1067 [2013]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988-989 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]).\nTurning to defendant\u2019s contentions with regard to his sentence, we are unconvinced that County Court imposed the enhanced sentence without making an adequate inquiry into whether or not defendant complied with the cooperation requirement of the plea agreement (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Crowder, 110 AD3d 1384, 1385-1386 [2013], lv granted 22 NY3d 1155 [2014]). While a valid appeal waiver typically precludes a challenge to the severity of even an enhanced sentence, the waiver does not foreclose such challenge where, as here, a defendant has not been advised of the maximum potential sentence at the time of the plea (see People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 686 [2003]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800 n [2001]; see generally People v Edie, 100 AD3d 1262, 1262 [2012]). Nonetheless upon review, we discern no abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d at 989).\nWe have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se brief, and have found them to be without merit.\nPeters, P.J., Lahtinen, McCarthy and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

On this appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant first argues that County Court did not advise him at the time of his plea that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender.

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant appeals, contending that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.\n\u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [citations omitted]). Here, a review of the record reveals that defense counsel negotiated a more favorable plea than that initially offered by the People. Furthermore, the agreed-upon sentence, which was less than the maximum, substantially reduced defendant\u2019s exposure to a more lengthy prison term if convicted after a trial. Although defendant maintains that defense counsel permitted him to make incriminating statements to County Court prior to entering into the plea, he has failed to demonstrate how he suffered any prejudice as a result of such statements (see People v Gifford, 285 AD2d 669). We find that, viewed in totality as of the time of the representation, defendant received meaningful representation (see People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806) and he failed to \u201c \u2018show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\u2019 \u201d (People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 18, quoting Hill v Lockhart, 474 US 52, 59).\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Carpinello, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Defendant was present at the residence during the search along with others. As a result, he was charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree. In satisfaction of the indictment, defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to the amended charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, to IV2 years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nInitially, the People concede, and we agree, that defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal was invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of People v Lopez (6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]) and, as such, he is not precluded from raising substantive challenges to the judgment of conviction (see People v Roshia, 133 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2015], affd 28 NY3d 989 [2016]). Defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective due to his failure to request a suppression hearing with respect to items confiscated during the search. He further claims that his Alford plea was invalid because it was involuntary and County Court accepted it without any strong evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Significantly, however, the record does not reveal that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion. Consequently, these claims have not been preserved for our review (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1563 [2017]; People v Saylor, 132 AD3d 1018, 1018 [2015]; People v Mears, 16 AD3d 917, 917-918 [2005]; People v Ebert, 15 AD3d 781, 782 [2005]). Furthermore, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d at 1563; People v Cooks, 150 AD3d 1323, 1324 [2017]). Accordingly, the judgment must be affirmed.\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Rose and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree following his Alford plea. Although the defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and that his plea was involuntary, the court found these issues unpreserved for review due to the lack of a postallocution motion and no statements during the plea colloquy that raised doubts about his guilt.

He later waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information. Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced to a prison term of five years and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant argues that his constitutional rights were violated by the Essex County Drug Court\u2019s refusal to accept him into the program.

De Berry v McMann, 24 AD2d 661). In any event, following her indictment defendant was rearraigned in County Court with assigned counsel present. Nor do we find any reason to disturb defendant\u2019s prison sentence of five years to life. First, defendant derived a benefit from pleading guilty as she was able to plead to an A-II felony instead of an A-I felony (compare, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i], with Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). In addition, several charges were dropped as a result of her plea and she was sentenced within the range promised when she entered her guilty plea. Under these circumstances, coupled with the fact that defendant did not receive the harshest sentence possible, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

The terms of the plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to a determinate prison sentence of as few as two and as many as nine years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, depending upon his level of cooperation with the authorities and compliance with the terms of his release between the plea and sentencing date. A recommendation of participation in a shock incarceration or comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program was also contemplated by the plea agreement. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision, with a recommendation for the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends that County Court should have considered him for youthful offender status and that counsel\u2019s failure to pursue youthful offender treatment at sentencing rendered his assistance ineffective. It is clear from the record that at the time defendant entered into the negotiated plea agreement, he was aware that it did not include youthful offender treatment. Additionally, the presentence investigation report indicated that defendant would potentially be a candidate for youthful offender treatment but made no recommendation in that respect. Defendant subsequently waived his right to be considered for youthful offender treatment by failing to make a request for such consideration (see People v Wise, 29 AD3d 1216, 1217 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 852 [2006]; People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]; People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810, 811-812 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 675 [2002]). Under such circumstances, County Court was not required to address the issue at sentencing (see People v Hopper, 39 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2007]).\nBecause defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cdoes not impact on the voluntariness of his plea, it is not properly before us due to his [valid] waiver of appeal\u201d (People v Wise, 29 AD3d at 1216; see People v Howard, 1 AD3d at 719).\nPeters, J.P., Spain, Malone Jr. and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

Defense counsel moved to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of the search of the hotel room. There were a number of adjournments of the suppression hearing and, before it was conducted, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. Consistent with the plea agreement, he was sentenced to two years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nDefendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s failure to proceed with the suppression hearing prior to defendant\u2019s entry of a guilty plea. To the extent that this claim has a bearing upon the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea, we find that it is unpreserved due to defendant\u2019s failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 119 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2014]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]; People v Stevenson, 58 AD3d 948, 949 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 860 [2009]). As for defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive, we find it to be unpersuasive. Defendant could have received a determinate sentence of anywhere from one to nine years in prison for the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [a] [i]). He received two years in prison instead and this was the sentence agreed to under the terms of the plea agreement. Therefore, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lawal, 73 AD3d 1287, 1290 [2010]; People v Muniz, 12 AD3d 937, 939 [2004]).\nLahtinen, J.E, McCarthy, Rose and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

At trial, the court dismissed the charge of endangering the welfare of a child. The jury subsequently found defendant guilty of the marihuana violation and a lesser included offense of the felony charge, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a misdemeanor. Defendant was sentenced to the maximum allowable jail period of one year for her conviction of the misdemeanor. Defendant appeals to this court alleging errors in sentencing.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the presentencing report was inflammatory and prejudicial. Our review of the report reveals nothing so prejudicial as to warrant reversal of her sentence. Indeed, the only arguably inflammatory material in the presentencing report was expressly disregarded by the sentencing court.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that it was error for the court not to disclose its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence is not supported by law. It is within the sentencing court\u2019s discretion whether or not to set forth on the record the reasons for the sentence imposed (see, CPL 380.50; Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 380.50, p 164). The court did not abuse its discretion in not elaborating on the factors it found relevant for sentencing purposes.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive is without merit. The sentence imposed was legally permissible and defendant, who admitted to a $100-a-day heroin and cocaine habit, has failed to show a clear abuse of discretion by the court or any extraordinary circumstances justifying a modification of her sentence (see, People v Mabry, 101 AD2d 961, 963).\nJudgment affirmed.

On January 26, 1998, a violation petition was filed after defendant was arrested and charged with, inter alia, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The charge was based on allegations that defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover investigator on July 15, 1997. A hearing ensued following which County Court concluded that defendant violated his probation. The court subsequently revoked probation and sentenced defendant to 2V3 to 7 years in prison, prompting this appeal.\nWe are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that he was denied due process because the probation violation hearing was held before the criminal trial on the underlying charge. Initially, defense counsel never sought an adjournment of the hearing on any ground nor did he object to the sequence of the proceedings (compare, People v Hilton, 179 Misc 2d 538; People v Davis, 161 Misc 2d 533); thus, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v Powell, 209 AD2d 645, 646, lv denied 85 NY2d 865; see also, CPL 470.05 [2]; see generally, People ex rel. Matthews v New York State Div. of Parole, 58 NY2d 201, 204-205). Even if we were to consider the argument in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [a]), we would find it to be without merit.\nIn arguing that the violation hearing should have been adjourned until after the trial on the underlying charge, defendant claims that his right to confront witnesses was compromised and that had there been an acquittal in the criminal action, a different result may have been reached by County Court in the instant matter. With respect to this latter point, we note simply that probation may be revoked even though there has been an acquittal or dismissal of criminal charges (see, People v Powell, supra; see also, People v Schneider, 188 AD2d 754, 757, lv denied 81 NY2d 892; compare, CPL 410.70 [3], with CPL 300.10). With respect to the former point, because the investigator who purchased the drugs from defendant testified at the hearing and defense counsel was given ample opportunity to cross-examine her, defendant was not deprived of his right to confrontation (cf., People ex rel. McGee v Walters, 62 NY2d 317). Because no principle of law required resolution of the violation hearing in this case to await resolution of the underlying criminal charge (see, People ex rel. Brooks v Russi, 237 AD2d 394, 395, lv denied 90 NY2d 801; People v Powell, supra; People v Davis, supra, at 535; compare, People v Spears, 64 NY2d 698; People ex rel. Piccarillo v New York State Bd. of Parole, 48 NY2d 76; People v Norris, 190 AD2d 871), we are unpersuaded that defense counsel\u2019s failure to request an adjournment rendered his assistance ineffective. Rather, upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that defendant was in fact provided with meaningful representation at the hearing (see, e.g., People v Griffith, 239 AD2d 705, 707).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including his claim that the People failed to prove he violated the conditions of his probation by a preponderance of the evidence and that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, have been reviewed and found to be without merit.\nMikoll, J.

Defendant appeals.\nAt the outset, we note that defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his current attack on the voluntariness of the plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Smith, 305 AD2d 853, 854 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 624 [2003]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635 [2001]). Were we to reach the issue, our examination of the plea minutes reveals that Supreme Court conducted a thorough and proper colloquy, during which it ascertained that defendant was entering the plea free of duress or any condition that would hamper his understanding or willingness to accept the consequences thereof, he had discussed the matter at length with his retained counsel and was satisfied with the services he provided, and he freely and unequivocally admitted to facts establishing the elements of the crime for which he was entering the plea (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 220.16; People v Smith, supra at 854; People v McWhite, 295 AD2d 757, 758 [2002]). In response to defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea, we note that there is no requirement that defendant personally recite the facts underlying his crime (see People v Kinch, 237 AD2d 830, 831 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 860 [1997]), particularly where, as here, defendant\u2019s affirmative answers during Supreme Court\u2019s inquiry therein neither cast doubt on his guilt nor otherwise raised any issues regarding the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lind, 298 AD2d 765, 766 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 616 [2003]). Defendant\u2019s additional argument that defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate possible defenses impacted the voluntariness of his plea finds no support in the record and, in any event, is belied by defendant\u2019s own statements that he had fully discussed his options with his counsel to his satisfaction (see People v Anderson, 304 AD2d 975, 976 [2003] , lv denied 100 NY2d 578 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]).

Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, the People and defendant both recommended that defendant be sentenced to a prison term of seven years and postrelease supervision of between one and two years. County Court deemed the recommended sentence to be inappropriate and sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant argues that no information properly before County Court justified its failure to impose the recommended sentence. County Court was not obligated to follow that recommendation, as it advised defendant of both its authority to render a different sentence and the maximum prison sentence that was permissible (see People v Watson, 61 AD3d 1217, 1219 [2009]; People v Rawdon, 296 AD2d 599, 599 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 771 [2002]).

Defendant contends that the recordings were insufficiently audible and, therefore, the submission to the jury of the recordings and their transcriptions was error. We find the contention without merit. The tapes were sufficiently audible and distinct to justify their admission (see, People v Sacchitella, 31 AD2d 180). Once audibility is established, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to admit transcripts as an aid to the jury (see, People v Kuss, 81 AD2d 427, 429). County Court did not abuse its discretion in this case.\nDefendant next challenges County Court\u2019s Sandoval ruling respecting the use of two convictions of assault in the third degree, committed in 1980 and 1983, to challenge his veracity. The nature and extent of cross-examination are within the sound discretion of County Court. We cannot say that there was an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s Sandoval ruling. The evidence was of probative value on the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility and was not so highly prejudicial as to require exclusion (see, People v Sandoval, 34 NY2d 371).\nFinally, defendant challenges his sentence as unnecessarily harsh and excessive.

The sole issue raised on this appeal is whether the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive and should, accordingly, be modified by this Court.\nAs defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea, this issue has not been preserved for our review (see People v Jimenez, 267 AD2d 615, 616, Iv denied 94 NY2d 921). Were we to reach it, however, we would find no evidence that it represents an abuse of judicial discretion nor are there any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mares, 256 AD2d 716, 717, Iv denied 93 NY2d 927).

On appeal, he contends that any jail time is harsh and excessive and requests that his sentence be modified to only require that he complete a specific mental illness and substance abuse treatment program.

He was sentenced to two years in prison, followed by two years of postrelease supervision.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s assertion that his guilty plea was involuntarily entered is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Vanguilder, 32 AD3d 1110 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 904 [2006]). In any event, were we to consider this contention, we would find that County Court fully advised defendant of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and it discussed the terms of the plea agreement, which included no sentencing commitment by the court other than that the sentence imposed would not exceed two years in prison. Defendant acknowledged that he understood these rights as well as the consequences of pleading guilty. Defendant then confirmed that he was entering the plea freely and admitted to having committed the crime. Under these circumstances, the record establishes that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and received the benefit of the plea bargain (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Schwing, 13 AD3d 725 [2004]).\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his verbal appeal waiver, we agree that the waiver was insufficient inasmuch as it failed to comply with the requirements set forth in People v Lopez (6 NY3d 248 [2006]).

The agreement also provided that if defendant failed to appear for sentencing without justification, County Court would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence and defendant would be exposed to persistent felony offender treatment and a sentence of 25 years to life. Sentencing was scheduled, and defendant was given Parker warnings (see, People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141) and admonished that, inter alia, failure to appear at sentencing would likely result in persistent felony offender treatment. Difficulties in arranging probation supervision of defendant necessitated County Court\u2019s intervention and resulted in an 18-day delay in defendant\u2019s release. At that time, defendant was again admonished concerning his scheduled sentencing.\nDefendant absconded only to be arrested several months later on a bench warrant. Defendant admitted that he did not have a legitimate excuse for his nonappearance, and pursuant to a sentencing bargain which included no prosecution on the bail jumping matter and an admission of his persistent felony offender status, he was sentenced to 15 years to life. Defendant appeals.\nThere is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that County Court\u2019s refusal to extend the date of sentencing after the 18-day delay in his presentence release warrants a reversal. This issue was not preserved for appellate review, for defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate his judgment of conviction (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Moreover, the record fails to establish how much of the delay was attributed to arranging supervision and how much to defendant\u2019s efforts to arrange bail. Despite the delay, defendant had three weeks of presentence release before his failure to appear.\nAlso unpersuasive is defendant\u2019s claim that he was not afforded an opportunity to explain his nonappearance. The ultimate sentence imposed was the result of a new bargain made because of, and following, defendant\u2019s failure to appear for his scheduled sentencing. Though the reason given by defendant for not appearing was acknowledged to be inadequate, defendant declined an opportunity to elaborate upon any justification or excuse. Inasmuch as the record established that defendant breached his unequivocal appearance requirement by absconding without any exculpatory reason, County Court\u2019s imposition of the enhanced sentence was not an abuse of discretion (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702).\nMikoll, J.

Defendant pleaded guilty to all of the charges in satisfaction of the indictment, as well as any uncharged crimes, and without any promise being made as to the sentence to be imposed. He was thereafter sentenced to six terms of 1 to 4 years in prison, three to run concurrently and three to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate prison term of 3 to 12 years.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record and the presentence investigation report, we disagree. Although defendant does not have a criminal record, he made five separate sales of cocaine to an undercover police officer in less than a one-month period of time. Inasmuch as each sale was a distinct act, consecutive sentences could have been imposed for each sale thereby further increasing the length of the sentence (see People v Kendrick, 261 AD2d 646 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1021 [1999]). Notably, the sentence actually imposed was less than the maximum authorized (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). Defendant\u2019s only excuse for his conduct was that he exercised poor judgment after becoming caught up in the use of cocaine himself. Neither this nor any other aspect of the case persuades us that there are extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]; People v Charron, 198 AD2d 722, 723 [1993], lv denied 83 NY2d 803 [1994]).

Additionally, a violation of probation proceeding was commenced against defendant as a result of her arrest on the aforementioned charges. After conferring with counsel, defendant agreed to accept the plea bargain offered by the People prior to the commencement of a hearing on pretrial motions. Accordingly, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived her right to appeal and, as agreed, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years upon her conviction of that crime and a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years for her admitted violation of probation.\nOn appeal, defendant challenges the voluntariness of her guilty plea. Although the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea is not encompassed in the waiver of her right to appeal, the issue is not preserved for our review inasmuch as she did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mondore, 18 AD3d 961, 961 [2005]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635 [2001]), and the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as the record of defendant\u2019s plea colloquy does not contain any statements tending to negate an element of the crime (see People v Mondore, supra at 961; People v Kemp, supra at 636).

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal by the defendant, as limited by his brief, from a sentence of the County Court, Nassau County (Brown, J.), imposed January 26, 2005, on the grounds that the sentence is excessive and illegal.\nOrdered that the sentence is affirmed.\nOn December 3, 2004, with the prosecutor\u2019s consent, the defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony, in full satisfaction of a superior court information which charged him with four separate class B felony drug offenses. In the course of his allocution, the defendant admitted that, on May 7, 2003, he sold a quantity of cocaine to another person. Upon his admission, he was adjudged a second felony offender, and he was promised the minimum permissible sentence of an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The matter was then adjourned for sentencing.\nOn January 26, 2005, the defendant appeared for sentencing. He claimed that he was entitled to the benefit of the relevant provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738) which had become effective on January 13, 2005, and which reduced the minimum sentence permissible for a prior felony offender convicted of a class C drug felony to a determinate term of two years imprisonment (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [ii]). The County Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention and sentenced him as promised to an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The defendant now appeals, claiming that, inter aha, as he was promised the minimum sentence permissible, the sentence imposed was illegal. We affirm.\nIn People v Behlog (74 NY2d 237, 240 [1989]), the Court of Appeals determined that, when the Legislature passes an ameliorative amendment that reduces the punishment for a crime, the lesser penalty may be imposed in all cases decided after the effective date of the enactment, even though the crime may have been committed before that date. The Court explained that the rationale for the rule is that \u201cby mitigating the punishment the Legislature is necessarily presumed\u2014absent some evidence to the contrary\u2014to have determined that the lesser penalty sufficiently serves the legitimate demands of the criminal law\u201d (id., emphasis supplied). As part of the Drug Law Reform Act (hereinafter the Act), however, the Legislature specifically provided that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, the Act\u2019s ameliorative provisions \u201cshall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof\u2019 (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]). That language is sufficient to indicate a legislative intent that the ameliorative provisions of the Act were not to be applied to crimes, like the one to which the defendant here pleaded guilty, committed prior to the effective date of the Act (see People v Goode, 25 AD3d 723 [2006]; People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005]; cf. People v Festo, 96 AD2d 765, 766 [1983], affd 60 NY2d 809 [1983]).\nTo the extent that the defendant contends that his sentence was excessive, his challenge is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Dixon, 5 AD3d 693, 694 [2004]; People v Chapman, 2 AD3d 647 [2003]). Crane, J.P., Rivera, Fisher and Dillon, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed his sentence of 3 to 6 years imprisonment for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, arguing it was excessive and illegal under the newly effective Drug Law Reform Act, which reduced minimum sentences. The court affirmed the sentence, stating that the Act's provisions did not apply to crimes committed before its effective date, and the defendant's prior waiver of the right to appeal precluded his argument regarding the sentence's excessiveness.</s>"}

When the plea was entered, County Court agreed to impose a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probationary supervision. The commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant\u2019s committing no Penal Law violations before the sentencing date. In the interim, however, defendant was arrested on a new charge. Defendant then agreed upon a disposition involving the new charge and a revised sentencing commitment on the assault charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the new charges, waiving his right to appeal, and was subsequently sentenced to negotiated concurrent terms of 1 to 3 years in prison on the assault conviction and 2 to 6 years on the drug charge. He now appeals, challenging the validity and severity of the sentences imposed.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s arguments, County Court did not err in imposing a more severe sentence on the assault charge upon defendant\u2019s breach of the conditional sentencing agreement (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718). County Court clearly indicated that its original sentence commitment was conditional and, in the event one of the conditions were breached, it would not be bound by its sentencing commitment but that defendant would still \u201cstand convicted\u201d. We note that at no time did defendant seek vacatur of his guilty plea on the assault charge or deny commission of the new offense, to which he also pleaded guilty. Thus, there is no merit to his contention that the court erred in not conducting a summary hearing (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713).\nFinally, even if defendant had not knowingly waived his right to appeal in the context of his guilty pleas (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032), we would nevertheless find his claim that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive to be without merit in light of his prior criminal history and the nature of the crimes.\nHer cure, Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur.

After pleading guilty to the new charge, he was sentenced to concurrent prison terms, and the court found no error in the imposition of a harsher sentence due to the breach of the conditional agreement.

Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and, although defendant failed to appear at sentencing, Supreme Court sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement as a predicate felon to SVa to 11 years in prison. On defendant\u2019s appeal, we affirm.\nDefendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing, arguing then and now on appeal that he is innocent and was pressured into pleading guilty. Supreme Court reviewed the transcript of the plea colloquy and gave defendant and his attorney an opportunity to be heard on the issue before denying defendant\u2019s motion. Mindful that the decision to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and having reviewed the plea colloquy and found that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and informed plea, in the course of which he made sufficient factual admissions to establish his guilt, we find no reason to disturb Supreme Court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 631-632 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; People v Babcock, 304 AD2d 912, 912 [2003]).\nNext, we find defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress the buy money found in his possession unpersuasive. Defendant\u2019s contention that the People failed to demonstrate the reliability of the confidential informant is inapposite given the fact that the confidential informant did not testify at the suppression hearing; indeed, the testimony of the officers involved in the arrest established that the police directly monitored the buy and, thus, obtained sufficient information to establish probable cause to make the arrest and seize the money without relying on any statements or observation made by the confidential informant (see People v Williams, 25 AD3d 927, 928-929 [2006]; People v Mendoza, 5 AD3d 810, 813 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 644 [2004]).\nFinally, we find no evidence that Supreme Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to the agreed upon sentence and no extraordinary circumstances which would persuade us to reduce defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Williams, supra at 929; People v Youmans, 11 AD3d 823 [2004]; People v Calkins, 6 AD3d 744, 746 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 671 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

She was sentenced to consecutive terms of one year in jail for each crime.

It is axiomatic that a defendant must demonstrate good cause for substitution of assigned counsel (see, People v Sawyer, 57 NY2d 12, cert denied 459 US 1178). The record in the case at bar fully supports County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request.\nAs a result of defendant\u2019s request for substitution of counsel, County Court undertook a painstaking inquiry concerning the reasons for such request.

There is a disagreement between defendant and the Public Defender as to whether the plea offer was tendered to defendant in \"open court\u201d.

County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 8 Vs to 25 years on five of the felony convictions (counts 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11) and to concurrent definite one-year jail terms\non five of the misdemeanor convictions (counts 2, 4, 6, 10 and 12), all to run consecutive to an SVs to 25-year term imposed on the remaining felony conviction (count 7). The one-year jail term for count 8 \u2014 which involved defendant\u2019s misdemeanor possession with intent to sell the same drugs for which he was convicted of selling under count 7 \u2014 is to run concurrently to the sentence imposed under count 7. On defendant\u2019s appeal, his sole contention is that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive.\nA review of the presentence report reveals that at the time of the crimes for which defendant stands convicted he was 18 years old and had completed an eighth grade education. He was previously involved in a drug treatment program which he reentered upon this incarceration. We have also considered, as did County Court, that at that time defendant was involved in a work release program in connection with a prior conviction upon a guilty plea for criminal sale of a controlled substance for which he had been adjudicated a youthful offender. We agree with County Court that the circumstances of these crimes involving six sales of narcotics on four different days during one month warranted a significant and lengthy sentence. However, considering all of the foregoing factors, we cannot agree that the defendant\u2019s conduct warranted an aggregate sentence of 162/s years to 50 years of imprisonment.\nWhile the imposition of the harshest consecutive sentence on count 7 in relation to the remaining sale counts was legally authorized since these sales occurred on different days, i.e., they involved separate acts (see, Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.25, 70.00 [2], [3]; see also, People v Brown, 80 NY2d 361, 364-365), we believe that the resulting aggregate sentence \u2014 a minimum of 162/s years and a maximum potential of 50 years \u2014was unduly severe in view of defendant\u2019s age, the nature of these crimes, his isolated prior conviction which did not represent an extensive criminal history, and the complete lack of any violent criminal history (see, People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302). While County Court properly took into consideration, inter alia, the fact that defendant had failed to learn from the opportunity presented to him by the youthful offender adjudication afforded for the prior crime he committed at age 16, we cannot agree that this or any other factor in defendant\u2019s background warranted this excessive aggregate minimum sentence. Accordingly, the SVs to 25-year sentence imposed on count 7 of the indictment is mod ified, in the interest of justice, to run concurrently \u2014 rather than consecutively \u2014 with the sentences imposed on the remaining counts, and the terms of imprisonment imposed are otherwise affirmed (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]; see also, People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783).\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the sentence imposed for defendant\u2019s conviction under count 7 of the indictment for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree be served concurrently with the remaining sentences, and, as so modified, affirmed.\nWe note that defendant\u2019s actual confinement would have been limited to 30 years by operation of law (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.30 [1] [e]; see also, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575). [/INST] The court modified the defendant's sentence for convictions related to multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of controlled substances, originally imposing an aggregate sentence of 16 \u00bd to 50 years. The appellate court found this sentence excessively harsh, considering the defendant's age, minimal criminal history, and lack of violent conduct. Consequently, the sentence for the most serious conviction was modified to run concurrently with the other sentences, while the rest of the sentencing was affirmed.</s>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defense counsel and the People offered a joint recommendation that defendant be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4x/2 to 9 years. Following the sentencing hearing, however, County Court imposed a sentence of 71/2 to 15 years in prison. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant contends that County Court abused its discretion \"in failing to accept the joint sentencing recommendation and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree. County Court was not bound by the sentencing recommendation and could properly impose a more severe sentence based upon defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history (see, People v Moore, 270 AD2d 715, 716; People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852).

As part of the agreement, he signed a six-page drug treatment court contract that, among other provisions, contained a paragraph waiving the right to appeal. Defendant entered the plea with the understanding that sentencing would be held in abeyance and, if he successfully completed a drug treatment program, he would receive a sentence of five years of probation; he was warned that if he did not comply, he could receive a sentence of imprisonment of up to 2 Vs to 7 years in prison. Defendant was terminated from the drug treatment program for violating conditions of the program and was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant appeals.\nUpon review of the record on appeal, we agree with defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was not valid as the record does not reflect that he was adequately advised that the right to appeal is \u201cseparate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-266 [2011]; People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d 861, 862 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1076 [2013]; People v Gilbert, 106 AD3d 1133, 1133 [2013]; compare People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Martin, 105 AD3d 1266, 1267 [2013]). While the court informed defendant that the drug treatment contract he signed as part of the plea agreement included an appeal waiver and elicited that he had reviewed it with counsel and understood and agreed to this condition, neither the colloquy nor the contract made clear that the right to appeal \u201cwould otherwise survive a guilty plea\u201d and is not \u201cautomatically extinguished upon entry of a guilty plea\u201d so as to reflect that \u201cdefendant comprehended the nature of the waiver of appellate rights\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264-267; compare People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 982-983 [2014]; People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v Diaz, 72 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]). As the appeal waiver is invalid, defendant is not precluded from challenging the sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255-256), but we find that his arguments in that regard are without merit. He was fully advised of the consequences of noncompliance with the drug treatment contract, including the maximum prison sentence, and was given every opportunity to succeed in drug treatment, where he repeatedly engaged in dishonest and deceitful behavior. Accordingly, we discern no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d at 864).\nStein, J.E, McCarthy, Garry and Devine, JJ, concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of .criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced to 330 days in the Chemung County Jail. Defendant was thereafter indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and ultimately entered a plea of guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. After denying defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea, County Court sentenced him as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years in accordance with the plea bargain.\nOn this appeal from the felony conviction, defendant claims that the offenses charged in the indictment and the prior drug possession offense were joinable in a single indictment pursuant to CPL 200.20 (2) (c) and that the prosecution abused its discretion by prosecuting them separately. Assuming that the claim has been preserved for our review, it has- no merit. Inasmuch as the crimes were not based on the same criminal transaction, the mandatory joinder provisions of CPL 40.40 were inapplicable and, therefore, defendant had no reason to believe that, after his plea to the possession crime, the People would forgo prosecution of the separate and distinct crimes based upon the drug sales. Defendant\u2019s speculation that a single indictment charging him with all three crimes \u201cwould probably have been resolved with a negotiated plea to a single count in satisfaction of the entire instrument\u201d is insufficient to create a new category of mandatory joinder, which would be the effect of accepting defendant\u2019s claim.\nDefendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea was based upon his desire to take advantage of parole supervision in an intensive drug treatment program as authorized by CPL 410.91. In denying the request, County Court explained that the program was only available to those convicted of class D or E felonies and that, in light of defendant\u2019s criminal history, the court would not agree to reduce the charges in the indictment below that of the class C felony to which defendant had entered his plea. In these circumstances, County Court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s request. Finally, the record on this direct appeal does not support defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).\nCrew III, J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Giardino, J.), rendered September 8, 2014, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).\nDefendant was charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He initially pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in full satisfaction of the indictment, with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to four years in prison, to be followed three years of postrelease supervision. The plea agreement also included the waiver of the right to appeal. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, there was discussion regarding defendant\u2019s eligibility for a shock incarceration program. Ultimately, defendant agreed to enter an additional plea of guilty to the remaining three counts of the indictment as well. This agreement was made with the understanding that, as a result of both pleas, he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to four concurrent 4x/2-year prison terms, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, together with an order directing his enrollment in a shock incarceration program. This additional agreement also included the waiver of the right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, his waivers of the right to appeal were valid. Based upon our review of the plea colloquies, County Court adequately distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea, particularly in light of defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his acknowledgment that he had previously executed an appeal waiver in regard to a previous guilty plea. Further, the court ensured that defendant understood the ramifications of the waivers and defendant executed a counseled written waiver in open court (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1349-1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]). Accordingly, defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. In light of his valid waivers of the right to appeal, his contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive is precluded (see People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1240 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]; People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Clark and Aarons, JJ., concur.

Consequently, the defendant's argument regarding the harshness of his sentence was rejected due to the valid appeal waivers.</s>"}

Five months later, in June 2010, he was arrested for possession of over 22 ounces of cocaine in Albany County and charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant then entered into a plea bargain on the Albany County charges and agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with a jail sentence of one year. After entering his plea in Albany County, but before sentencing, he pleaded guilty to the charge in Washington County and received a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision. When defendant later appeared for sentencing in Albany County, County Court indicated that it had not been aware of the prior arrest in Washington County and refused to sentence him as originally agreed. Defendant rejected a new offer of two years of imprisonment, and he was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. After a jury trial, he was found guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and County Court sentenced him to a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed in Washington County.\nDefendant appeals, arguing that he is entitled to specific performance of his plea agreement in Albany County because he had detrimentally relied upon it when he entered into his Washington County plea bargain. We are unpersuaded. Defendant did not make this argument when he appeared for sentencing on his Albany County plea agreement. Moreover, in the absence of any indication in the record that County Court considered the Washington County charge as part of the Albany County plea agreement, the court was entitled to rely on the new information in determining that it was unwilling to abide by the agreement and, therefore, defendant was appropriately restored to the status quo upon withdrawal of his plea (see People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340, 348 [1980]; People v Bonville, 69 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2010]; People v Brooks, 284 AD2d 796, 797-798 [2001]; see also People v Walker, 187 AD2d 909, 909 [1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 796 [1993]).\nFurther, we do not find that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh or excessive. Although defendant points out that his criminal history is limited to the two 2010 arrests, County Court took this factor into consideration in determining that a maximum sentence was not warranted (see People v Williams, 65 AD3d 1423, 1424 [2009]). Nor do we find that defendant\u2019s claimed substance abuse problems rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances (see People v Potter, 54 AD3d 444, 445 [2008]; People v May, 301 AD2d 784, 786 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 564 [2003]). In the absence of such circumstances, we decline to disturb County Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in imposing the sentence.\nLahtinen, J.E, McCarthy, Egan Jr. and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, rejecting his claim for specific performance of a plea agreement due to the absence of an argument during sentencing and the lack of consideration for his prior Washington County charge.

Following County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived her right to appeal any issues relating to her conviction or sentence, and signed a written waiver instrument to that effect.

Notably, County Court specifically advised defendant during the plea allocution that she was forfeiting her right to suppress any evidence by entering the plea, and defendant indicated that she understood. Moreover, inasmuch as her argument does not impact the voluntariness of her guilty plea, defendant\u2019s valid waiver of appeal also forecloses her claim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise the People of her intention to testify before the grand jury amounted to a denial of the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 681 [2002]; cf.

Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 8V3 years to life, the maximum term of imprisonment for an A-II felony. On this appeal, defendant contends that the sentence was harsh and excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant also argues that County Court failed to exercise any discretion in accepting the plea and the condition that defendant be sentenced to the severest allowable sentence.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was cruel and unusual. The statute in question is not uncon stitutional on its face (see, People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert denied 423 US 950). Further, given the amount of cocaine involved and defendant\u2019s admitted knowing possession, we do not find that this is one of the \"rare case[s]\u201d envisioned in People v Broadie (supra, at 119) in which the application of the statute constitutes cruel and unusual punishment (see, People v Marine, 162 AD2d 275; People v Miller, 126 AD2d 868, lv denied 69 NY2d 884). In addition, in light of these facts, as well as the facts that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged and agreed to the sentence as a part of a negotiated plea bargain, we do not find that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive (see, People v Hadden, 158 AD2d 856, lv denied 76 NY2d 847).\nWe find, however, that County Court erred in failing to exercise its discretion in sentencing defendant. In accepting defendant\u2019s plea, County Court stated that it was \"obligated\u201d to impose the harshest sentence allowable based upon the plea bargain. The failure of County Court to exercise its independent judgment requires that the case be remitted to County Court for resentencing (see, People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822).

In any event, defendant has an extensive criminal history and was sentenced to a prison term well above either the pre- or postamendment minimum, and counsel\u2019s alleged failure to consider the amendment did not deprive defendant of meaningful representation (see People v Modica, 64 NY2d 828, 829 [1985]; People v Palma, 305 AD2d 333, 334 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 644 [2003]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea is similarly unpreserved for our review, and he made no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Martinez, 79 AD3d 1378, 1378-1379 [2010]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). His valid appeal waiver forecloses his remaining attack upon the agreed-upon sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385).\nLahtinen, J.E, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur.

That motion was made orally by defendant subsequent to the jury selection and prior to opening statements. The record reveals that defendant had been convicted of two illegal sales of alcoholic beverages in 1972, and that in the same year defendant was arrested in California on three separate occasions. The court ruled that questioning of these events on cross-examination would be impermissible if defendant testified on his own behalf. A 1973 conviction of obstruction of governmental administration was also ruled inadmissible and the prosecution agreed not to cross-examine concerning it. The prosecution further agreed not to cross-examine concerning a 1974 conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance because of the similarity of that conviction to the crime charged, and agreed not to cross-examine about defendant\u2019s arrest for the crime of menacing in 1983. The court also ruled a 1978 conviction of disorderly conduct inadmissible.\nBy further ruling, the trial court permitted a 1975 conviction of possession of a forged instrument, 1975 convictions of burglary in the third degree and petit larceny, and a 1983 conviction of resisting arrest to be utilized on cross-examination if defendant elected to testify. Defendant did so testify on his own behalf, so our review is limited to the prejudicial effect that the prosecutor\u2019s permitted cross-examination about the unrelated crimes might have had on the minds of the jury.\nIn the circumstances, we find the discretion of the trial court to have been carefully and properly exercised, especially since the jury was cautioned that the convictions were to be considered only on the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we do not find the 1975 convictions so remote as to require their suppression.\nUpon conviction, defendant received an indeterminate prison sentence of 2 to 4 years. Additionally, the trial court imposed a mandatory surcharge of $75 under Penal Law \u00a7 60.35. The imposition of this surcharge was mandatory and constitutional (People v Dodson, 96 AD2d 1116, 1118). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Casey, Mikoll and Yesawich, Jr., JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree, ruling that the trial court properly exercised its discretion regarding the admissibility of the defendant's prior convictions for cross-examination purposes.

The defendant did not deny the conviction but claimed that it had been unconstitutionally obtained because, when he pleaded guilty, he had been under the influence of drugs and had said so to the federal judge in open court during the transcribed plea proceeding. The defendant stated that he requested a copy of the minutes of the proceeding to support his claim. The court adjourned the matter for eight days for a hearing.\nOn the adjourned date, the defendant reported that he had not yet received the minutes. The court, however, revealed that its chambers had contacted the defendant\u2019s attorney in the prior federal case and had received a letter from that attorney stating that, to the best of his recollection, the defendant had been incarcerated at the time of the federal plea of guilty and was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. Additionally, the court disclosed that its chambers had contacted the federal judge who had taken the defendant\u2019s plea. According to the court, the federal judge said that, to his recollection, when the defendant pleaded guilty, he had not been under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or anything else. The court announced that it found that \u201cthe Federal Court Judge was credible and the Federal Defender was credible,\u201d but that the defendant was \u201cincredible.\u201d Accordingly, based on what it termed \u201coverwhelming evidence,\u201d the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, adjudicated him a second felony offender, and imposed sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that he was not properly adjudicated a second felony offender. We agree.\nCPL 400.21 prescribes the procedure for determining whether a defendant is a second felony offender. Where a defendant controverts an allegation necessary to support a finding that he or she has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction, the court must hold a hearing at which the People bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cby evidence admissible under the rules applicable to a trial of the issue of guilt\u201d that the \u201cdefendant has been subjected to such a predicate felony conviction\u201d (CPL 400.21 [7] [a]). Because the statute provides that \u201c[a] previous conviction . . . which was obtained in violation of the rights of the defendant under the . . . constitution of the United States must not be counted in determining whether the defendant has been subjected to ... a predicate felony conviction\u201d (CPL 400.21 [7] [b]), a defendant may oppose a second felony offender adjudication by asserting that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Where such an assertion is made, however, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim with substantial evidence sufficient to overcome the presumptions of the validity and regularity of the prior conviction (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15-16 [1983]; People v Pierre, 45 AD3d 1056 [2007]).\nHere, the defendant proposed to carry his burden by presenting the transcribed minutes of his federal plea proceeding which, he claimed, would show that his conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained because his plea was accepted despite his on-the-record statement that he was under the influence of drugs. The court did not reject his claim on the ground that such a plea would nevertheless be constitutional or that the defendant had unreasonably delayed in producing the minutes. Instead, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim based on the reported results of its own investigation and the information privately provided to it by a federal judge and a defense attorney. This was improper. Moreover, in addition to the fact that the defendant had no opportunity to confront the federal judge or his prior attorney, to the extent that their statements were considered by the court to prove the truth of the assertion that the defendant was not under the influence of drugs at the time of his federal plea, the statements were hearsay and not, as required by the applicable statute, \u201cevidence admissible under the rules applicable to a trial of the issue of guilt\u201d (CPL 400.21 [7] [a]).\nAccordingly, the sentence must be reversed and the matter remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for a new predicate felony hearing and resentence before a different Justice. Fisher, J.E, Miller, Dillon and Eng, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court reversed the defendant's sentence for criminal possession of a controlled substance, adjudicating him as a second felony offender, due to improper handling of evidence regarding his prior conviction. The court found that the lower court's reliance on hearsay from a federal judge and defense attorney, without allowing the defendant to confront them or present his evidence, violated the procedural requirements of CPL 400.21. The case is remitted for a new hearing on the predicate felony status and resentencing before a different judge.</s>"}

Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal and was to be sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 15 years. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing a warrant was issued for her arrest. Two years later, defendant was located in California and extradited to New York, where she was arraigned on bail jumping in the first degree. Defendant thereafter moved to withdraw her plea on the ground that her counsel coerced her to plead guilty. Following a hearing, County Court denied the motion. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to bail jumping in the first degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 8 to 24 years on the criminal sale and criminal possession convictions and 21/s to 7 years on the bail jumping conviction.

In this regard, defendant contends that her counsel coerced her to plead guilty to the drug charges. A review of the record, however, does not substantiate her assertions.\nDuring the plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant of the terms of the plea, including the appeal waiver, and fully informed her of her rights. Defendant indicated that she understood the rights that she was relinquishing by entering a guilty plea and had not been coerced or threatened to do so. She further stated that she had discussed the plea with her attorney and was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. Defendant then admitted that she sold cocaine to an undercover informant on three separate occasions and possessed cocaine on a fourth occasion. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see People v Collins, 306 AD2d 695 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 619 [2003]), and we find her guilty plea to be voluntary, knowing and intelligent (see People v Hodge, 4 AD3d 676, 677 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 800 [2004]).

During jury selection, a prospective juror sent a letter to County Court stating that he was actively running a business and asked to be exempt from jury duty. When the prospective juror was questioned, he explained that during the first day of jury selection his business had a problem, and his efforts to resolve the problem caused him to get little sleep that night. The court asked if he could put someone else in charge, to which he replied, \u201cI will try, but it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d He stated that it would be hard for him to sit on the jury, but it would not be impossible, and indicated that he was not trying to shirk his civic duty. Defense counsel unsuccessfully challenged the juror for cause, then elected to use a peremptory challenge. Following trial, the jury convicted defendant of all counts. He now appeals.\nCounty Court appropriately exercised its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s challenge for cause. A defendant may challenge for cause a prospective juror who \u201chas a state of mind that is likely to preclude him [or her] from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial\u201d (CPL 270.20 [1] [b]). Slight interference with employment or inconvenience related to sitting on a jury are insufficient grounds to support a challenge for cause (see People v Ciochenda, 17 AD3d 248, 248 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 760 [2005]; People v Willard, 226 AD2d 1014, 1017-1018 [1996], appeal dismissed 88 NY2d 943 [1996]; People v Dunkley, 189 AD2d 776, 777 [1993], lv denied 81 NY2d 884 [1993]; cf.

Moreover, absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s determination concerning whether a prospective juror can sit in a particular case (see People v Busreth, 35 AD3d 965, 966-967 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 920 [2007]).\nHere, although the juror expressed his inconvenience and inability to run his business efficiently while he was on jury duty, he reassured County Court that he placed a high value on jury service and that he would serve if chosen. Considering that almost every potential juror is inconvenienced by taking a week or more away from one\u2019s work or normal routine, and that each has personal concerns which could cause some distraction from a trial, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s challenge for cause (see People v Michael, 48 NY2d 1, 10 [1979]; see also Matter of Colcloughley v Johnson, 115 AD2d 58, 62 [1986], lv denied 68 NY2d 604 [1986]).\nMercure, J.E, Spain, Lahtinen and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

Thus, an erroneous denial of a challenge for cause would constitute reversible error (see CPL 270.20 [2]). [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of multiple drug-related charges. The defendant challenged a juror for cause due to the juror's expressed difficulties in balancing his business obligations with jury duty; however, the court found no abuse of discretion in denying the challenge since the juror demonstrated a commitment to fulfill his civic duty. The court ruled that mere inconvenience is insufficient grounds for a cause challenge, and the defendant's subsequent exhaustion of peremptory challenges meant that any error in the cause ruling would not warrant reversal.</s>"}

No promises were made regarding sentencing, and sentencing was adjourned to allow defendant to continue treatment for his opiate addiction. After defendant was discharged from a treatment program for noncompliance, County Court imposed a prison term of IV3 to 4 years on the stolen property conviction, and concurrent four-year prison terms followed by two years of postrelease supervision on each of the drug convictions, the latter sentences to be served consecutively to the former.

County Court thereafter sentenced him to eight years in prison, to be followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision, with the sentence to run concurrently to a sentence he was currently serving. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s contention that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel were not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Trombley, 115 AD3d 1114, 1114 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1068 [2014]). As to the plea, we note that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was triggered by defendant\u2019s initial denial during the plea colloquy that he had the intent to sell the narcotics, thus negating an element of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1]), and triggering a duty on the part of County Court to conduct further inquiry (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Peterson, 124 AD3d 993, 994 [2015]; People v Morehouse, 109 AD3d 1022, 1022 [2013]). However, the record reveals that the court did then conduct sufficient further inquiry of defendant to confirm that he understood the nature of the charge and ensure the validity of the plea, and defendant thereafter admitted to having the requisite intent to sell. \u201c [A] s defendant failed to express any dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s remedial action in this regard, defendant has waived any further challenge to his allocution\u201d (People v English, 100 AD3d 1147, 1148 [2012]; see People v Karolys, 85 AD3d 1213 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 818 [2011]).

The plea arose out of defendant\u2019s sale of cocaine to an undercover informant at defendant\u2019s home on July 14, 1986. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to six months\u2019 incarceration and five years\u2019 probation.\nOn this appeal, defendant complains of the ineffective assistance of his attorney due to the attorney\u2019s failure to make certain pretrial motions. We find this contention meritless in view of the attorney\u2019s experience, the overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt and the favorable plea bargain that defendant made (People v Ellsworth, 131 AD2d 109, 111; People v Bonk, 83 AD2d 695). As to defendant\u2019s claim of his attorney\u2019s failure to make pretrial motions, there was no basis for a Wade hearing, and a hearing pursuant to People v Darden (34 NY2d 177) was held after which County Court issued a written decision finding that the informant verified the information attributed to him in the search warrant, that the source of the informant\u2019s information was from his own personal observations and from conversations with defendant, and it was found that the informant had given reliable information in the past. We agree with the determination of County Court that the test of People v Darden (supra) was satisfied.\nWe likewise find meritless defendant\u2019s claim in regard to the excessiveness of his sentence. Considering defendant\u2019s conviction of a class D felony and the seriousness of that charge, as well as defendant\u2019s favorable plea bargain, the sentence was warranted (see, People v McAllister, 58 AD2d 712).\nFinally, although nine months elapsed between defendant\u2019s conviction and his sentencing, we do not find the delay unreasonable (see, Matter of Braunstein v Frawley, 64 AD2d 772, 773). Defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree following a guilty plea.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAarons, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered March 24, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was charged in two indictments with various drug-related crimes arising from his sale of heroin to undercover police and the execution of a search warrant at his home. Defendant moved pursuant to CPL 216.05 for judicial diversion based upon his alleged drug addiction, and the motion was denied by County Court. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all charges. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nInitially, defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to follow the procedure prescribed by CPL 216.05 and request a substance abuse evaluation in connection with the motion for judicial diversion. This claim, however, has not been preserved for our review as defendant did not raise it before County Court, and the record does not reveal that he made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea on this ground (see People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]).\nDefendant further argues that his counsel was ineffective in abandoning his request for a Mapp hearing and recommending that he enter a guilty plea when defendant was not in the proper state of mind. Although clearly impacting the voluntariness of his guilty plea, this claim is also unpreserved given that the record does not disclose that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Cooks, 150 AD3d 1323, 1324 [2017]; People v Hankerson, 147 AD3d 1153, 1153 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 998 [2017]; People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]). Nevertheless, we find that the narrow exception to the preservation rule was triggered by defendant\u2019s initial statement during the plea colloquy that he did not know that the substance was heroin, thereby negating an element of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1]) and imposing a duty upon County Court to conduct a further inquiry (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d 1407, 1407 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). The record indicates that County Court further questioned defendant concerning his knowledge of the substance and briefly recessed the proceeding to allow him to confer with counsel after which defendant admitted that he knew that the substance was, in fact, heroin. Defendant has not contested County Court\u2019s remedial action, and there is no indication that he was mentally impaired at the time that he entered his guilty plea (see People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 998 [2016]). Accordingly, we find that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Pixley, 150 AD3d 1555, 1556 [2017]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d at 1407). Furthermore, we find that he received an advantageous plea and that nothing in the record casts doubt upon his counsel\u2019s effectiveness (see People v McCray, 139 AD3d 1235, 1237 [2016]; People v Seuffert, 104 AD3d 1021, 1022 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1009 [2013]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr., Devine and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nTo the extent that defendant also challenges County Court\u2019s failure to comply with the procedures set forth in CPL 216.05, this is the type of claim that is foreclosed by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea (see People v Sirico, 135 AD3d 19, 23-25 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1075 [2016]). [/INST] The appeal stems from a guilty plea by the defendant, convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following drug-related charges. The defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and improper procedures regarding judicial diversion were deemed unpreserved for review, as he did not raise these issues in the County Court. Ultimately, the court affirmed the judgment, finding the guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, and there was no evidence of mental impairment at the time of the plea.</s>"}

Judgment reversed on the law, and ease remitted to the Criminal Term for resentenee in accordance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Defendant was charged with a felony and appeared to be addicted to heroin (see Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 207). \" Accordingly, he could not be sentenced until there was compliance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law which require, inter alia, that the court order a physical examination to determine if defendant is an addict and have the report of the examination before it prior to rendering judgment \u201d (People v. Largue, 38 A D 2d 833; People v. Sczerbaty, 37 A D 2d 428; People v. Odom, 32 A D 2d 651; People ex rel. Ali v. La Vallee, 36 AD 2d 140; People v. Rosser, 36 A D 2d 35; People v. Woodward, 36 A D 2d 1018; People v. Smith, 37 A D 2d 798). In addition, defendant is entitled to the opportunity to admit, deny or stand mute on the issue of addiction (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208, subd. 1; People v. Roston, 37 A D 2d 624). Martuseello, Acting P. J., Latham, Christ and Brennan, JJ., concur; Benjamin, J., dissents in the following memorandum: I see no point in reversing and remitting for resentenee because of technical noncompliance with Mental Hygiene Law (\u00a7\u00a7 207, 208), since that would merely put defendant into a revolving door and he would come out in exactly the same place. At a Huntley hearing held before defendant pleaded guilty, he testified that he was a drug addict. When he pleaded guilty (before the same Judge who had held the Huntley hearing), the Judge indicated that he would impose a jail sentence. At sentencing (before the same Judge), defense counsel said that defendant had a drug problem and that he should get as short a jail sentence as possible; he did not request NACC. The probation report shows that defendant was examined in the Nassau County Jail and certified as an addict three months before he pleaded guilty. That report also shows that defendant had a long record of burglaries, larcenies, drugs and robbery; and that he had previously tried civil drug centers in New York and California, but they had not helped him. Defendant\u2019s brief on appeal does not contend that sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law, were not complied with; it merely argues that NACC would have been more appropriate than a jail sentence, and thus concedes that he is an addict. It is clear from this record that at the time of sentence everyone (the court, prosecutor, defense counsel and defendant) knew that defendant was an addict and was being sent to jail, not NACC, despite that fact; and that defendant acquiesced in that type of sentence, and did not request NACC, but merely asked that it be a shorter jail sentence. It is also clear that the jail sentence, instead of NACC, was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion, in view of defendant\u2019s record and previous lack of success with civil drug centers; and there is ample material in this record (colloquies at plea and sentence, and the probation report) for a review by us of that exercise of discretion. In light of these facts, I see no point in remitting for resentence, so that defendant can again concede that he is an addict and the court can again impose the same jail term as it did originally. In the recent ease of People v. Crafton (38 A D 2d 833), we were confronted with the same situation as in the present ease; by a 4 to 1 vote (Shapiro, Gulotta, Christ, Benjamin, JJ.; Martuscello, Acting P. J., dissenting) we affirmed the judgment on the theory that the defendant had already admitted his addiction and had, in effect, waived his right under section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law to dispute a report finding him addicted. We should do the same here, namely, affirm the judgment. [/INST] The defendant's appeal from a judgment convicting him of second-degree robbery and sentencing him to up to seven years in prison was reversed due to noncompliance with the Mental Hygiene Law, which requires a physical examination to confirm addiction before sentencing. The court remitted the case for resentencing, allowing the defendant the opportunity to address his addiction status, despite the dissenting opinion arguing that remitting would not change the outcome given the defendant's acknowledgment of his addiction and the court's discretion to impose a jail sentence based on his record.</s>"}

County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to nine years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was valid. Both County Court and the detailed written waiver executed by defendant in open court informed him that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea, and the court confirmed that he had discussed the waiver with counsel and understood its ramifications. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Pandori, 133 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2015]; People v Mayo, 130 AD3d 1099, 1099-1100 [2015]).

In any event, we find the claim to be unpersuasive. Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to counsel submitting a lengthy presentence memorandum too close to the sentencing date to allow County Court to properly evaluate it when determining his sentence. County Court stated that it had reviewed the memorandum prior to sentencing, however, and defense counsel orally made the case for a more lenient sentence based upon defendant\u2019s medical records before County Court imposed sentence. Accordingly, if this issue were properly before us, we would find that it was without merit (see People v Johnson, 267 AD2d 609, 610 [1999]).\nPeters, P.J., McCarthy, Egan Jr. and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Berke, J.), rendered April 17, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nDefendant was charged in a four-count indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child. Represented by the Public Defender, defendant originally chose to go to trial. On March 3, 1998, however, the date of the scheduled Huntley and Mapp hearings, defendant informed County Court that she wished to enter an Alford plea of guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. County Court conducted a lengthy colloquy to determine whether defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, informing her of the strong evidence of her guilt of the charged crimes and noting that if she were to proceed to trial and be found guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, she could be sentenced to a prison term of SVs to 25 years. The court then accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing hearing. On the date thereof, defendant informed County Court that she had decided to withdraw her guilty plea and proceed to trial, arguing that the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 6 years was excessive due to her status as a drug addict at the time the charged crimes were committed. County Court denied the request and proceeded to impose the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant has served the minimum two-year term of her sentence and has been released. She appeals from the judgment of conviction.\nWe affirm. Defendant, facing a strong case against her and a potential sentence of 8V3 to 25 years in prison, entered an Alford plea. The record shows said plea to have been knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made with a full understanding of its consequences thus rendering the plea valid (see, People v Ruger, 279 AD2d 795, 796, lv denied 96 NY2d 806). Therefore, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s request to withdraw her plea.\nIn addition, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s assertions that the Public Defender failed to provide her with effective assistance of counsel, as evidenced by an alleged failure to participate in Huntley, Mapp and Sandoval hearings. Defense counsel had filed an omnibus pretrial motion which was duly granted by County Court. The Huntley and Mapp hearings were scheduled to take place on the date when defendant elected to enter her Alford plea while the Sandoval hearing was scheduled to take place immediately prior to the start of her trial. As these hearings were canceled after they had been rendered moot by defendant\u2019s plea, she cannot now complain that her right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because they were not held.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been examined and found to be either unpreserved for our review or without merit.\nMercure, J.

Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 15 years. Defendant now appeals.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that the judgment of conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. A claimed violation of the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel will not survive judicial scrutiny \u201c \u2018[s]o long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u2019 \u201d (People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998], quoting People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; see People v Wiltshire, 96 AD3d 1227, 1229 [2012], lv denied 22 NY3d 1204 [2014]). In particular, after defendant\u2019s counsel failed to ask the investigator during cross-examination if he performed field testing on the substances that he purchased from defendant, County Court denied defendant\u2019s subsequent request to admit the investigator\u2019s purportedly inconsistent grand jury testimony due to counsel\u2019s failure to lay a foundational basis. In particular, during his trial testimony, the investigator explained how he processed the drugs after he purchased them from defendant, but made no specific mention of field testing the substances. The investigator\u2019s testimony, however, was not inconsistent with his prior grand jury testimony, during which he allegedly stated that he had field tested the drugs that defendant had sold to him and, therefore, there was no testimony that could be used for impeachment purposes. Moreover, although counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the issue of field testing while questioning the investigator was not a tactical decision, we do not agree that one isolated misstep of this nature was so \u201cegregious and prejudicial as to compromise . . . defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial\u201d (People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]; accord People v Ford, 110 AD3d 1368, 1370 [2013], lv denied 24 NY3d 1043 [2014]).\nAs to defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive, County Court sentenced defend ant to serve two concurrent prison terms of 12 years for the criminal possession and criminal sale convictions stemming from the first of two drug sales, which were set to run consecutively with the two concurrent prison terms of three years for the criminal sale and criminal possession convictions resulting from the second drug sale. Defendant argues that, because both drug sales involved small quantities of drugs and occurred within a short period of time, the court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences. We disagree. While the drug sales occurred in a somewhat \u201cclose temporal proximity,\u201d they were separate criminal transactions (People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]; see People v Brown, 80 NY2d 361, 363-364 [1992]). Therefore, given the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion, we decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to modify defendant\u2019s sentences (compare People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888, 890-891 [2005]; People v Holmes, 304 AD2d 1043, 1045 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 642 [2003]).\nLahtinen, J.P., Egan Jr. and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

Prior to sentencing, defendant moved pro se to withdraw his guilty plea alleging that it was rendered involuntary by defense counsel\u2019s coercion and various defects in the plea allocution. County Court denied the motion following a hearing and ultimately imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s failure to recite sufficient facts to establish each and every element of the pleaded to crimes during the allocution does not require invalidation of the plea, particularly since defendant admitted to all of the factual allegations underlying the crimes after they were recited by County Court and made no statement which tended to negate an essential element of the crimes (see, People v Beuther, 236 AD2d 661, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Moreover, our review of the record reveals no support for the proposition that defendant\u2019s plea was rendered involuntary by defense counsel\u2019s conduct or the lack of adequate time to consider the plea offer (see, People v Mingues, 256 AD2d 657). Rather, we find that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered February 26, 2004, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nDefendant waived indictment and was charged in a superior court information with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. He pleaded guilty to this charge and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be placed on interim probation for one year and, if he successfully completed that term, he would be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced to additional probation. The sentence, however, was expressly made contingent on defendant cooperating with probation and abstaining from committing other crimes or being arrested. Defendant was sentenced accordingly. Subsequently, after it was revealed that defendant had falsified his identity and was a second felony offender, he was arrested and charged with numerous offenses, including perjury, forgery, criminal impersonation and false personation. The People moved to amend the caption of the superior court information to reflect defendant\u2019s proper identity and alias, and also to vacate defendant\u2019s sentence as illegal. Defendant, in turn, requested permission to withdraw his plea. County Court granted the People\u2019s applications, denied defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea and resentenced him to 5 to 10 years in prison as an admitted second felony offender. He now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole argument is that the 5 to 10-year prison term imposed upon resentencing is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was fully informed during the plea proceedings that County Court would not be bound to sentence him as agreed in the event he failed to cooperate with probation, committed additional crimes or was rearrested. Yet, during those very proceedings, defendant had assumed a false identity and lied about his criminal background resulting in the eventual filing of additional criminal charges against him. Under these circumstances, and given defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal record, we do not find an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the enhanced sentence, which was less than the statutory maximum, in the interest of justice (see People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]; People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 686 [2003]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Spain, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

On March 28, 1994, he obtained permanent resident status through his parents.\nIn 2002, the defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and certain lesser included offenses. On February 14, 2003, he pleaded guilty to a single count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, in satisfaction of Queens County superior court information No. 10034/03. At the plea proceeding, the defendant was represented by attorney Phillip Middler, who was handling the case for the defendant\u2019s attorney, William Ezersky. The Supreme Court asked defense counsel, \u201cIs there any issue as to deportation of your client as a result of this?\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility of that, Judge.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cHe still wants the plea despite that issue?\u201d and defense counsel replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The court asked, \u201cCounsel, have you discussed these matters with your client?\u201d and defense counsel replied, \u2018Yes.\u201d\nThe defendant was promised a sentence of probation for a period of five years, with a condition that he complete a certain program. He was also advised that his driver license privileges would be suspended. He waived his right to appeal. On April 24, 2003, the promised sentence was imposed, and the defendant did not appeal from the judgment of conviction.\nOn July 31, 2012, the defendant applied to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for United States citizenship. On July 2, 2013, his application was denied on the ground that the offense of which he had been convicted, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was an aggravated felony as defined in 8 USC \u00a7 1101 (a) (43). Thus, as a matter of law, the conviction had rendered him permanently ineligible for naturalization. Thereafter, the United States Department of Homeland Security commenced a removal proceeding against him, and he was taken into custody and held in a facility operated by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit of the Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter ICE) in New Jersey while he awaited mandatory deportation.\nOn or about July 3, 2014, the defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his judgment of conviction, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the entry of his plea of guilty. The defendant claimed, in an affidavit, that his attorney never advised him that he would be subject to mandatory deportation if he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Rather, he allegedly was advised that \u201cit was only possible\u201d that he would be deported as a result of his conviction. He claimed he never would have pleaded guilty if he had known the true immigration consequences. He alleged that he \u201cwas not guilty of the sale that I was accused of, but rather, only pled guilty because my attorney told me that it was the only way to avoid going to jail for a prolonged period of time, and because, he said I would have a chance to prevail if Immigration tried to deport me.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney on the motion submitted an affirmation stating that he spoke to Middler, the attorney who appeared on behalf of the defendant at the plea proceeding, and asked Middler to submit an affirmation in support of the motion. However, Middler did not return defense counsel\u2019s subsequent messages, and defense counsel was therefore unable to obtain an affirmation from Middler.\nBy order dated September 22, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court, citing People v Argueta (46 AD3d 46 [2007]), reasoned that the defendant\u2019s allegation that his attorney advised him that deportation was merely possible rather than mandatory \u2014 even if true \u2014 was not an affirmative misrepresentation and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also determined that the defendant\u2019s claims were supported solely by his \u201cself-serving\u201d allegations, without an affidavit from his former attorney concerning the advice that he actually received as to the immigration consequences of his plea of guilty.\nOn or about November 3, 2014, the defendant, represented by new counsel, moved, in effect, to renew his motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. His attorney on this motion stated in his affirmation that he contacted the defendant\u2019s original attorney for the criminal proceeding, William Ezersky, about the advice Ezersky gave the defendant, and was informed that Ezersky no longer had a file on the case, and had no memory of the case. In an affidavit, the defendant claimed that Ezersky advised him, on the morning of the day he pleaded guilty, that people in his position are rarely deported, and if the defendant were \u201cput in proceedings, [he] would have a good chance of not getting deported.\u201d By order dated January 29, 2015, the Supreme Court denied the motion. Citing CPL 440.10 (3) (b) and (c), the court concluded that the issue raised was previously determined against the defendant on the merits, and the defendant could have raised all grounds or issues in his prior motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. The defendant appeals, by permission, from the orders dated September 22, 2014, and January 29, 2015.\nCPL 440.10 provides that the court \u201cmust\u201d deny a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction when the ground or issue raised was previously determined on the merits on appeal from the judgment, or there were sufficient facts in the record which would have permitted appellate review of the issue on direct appeal, but no review occurred owing to the defendant\u2019s unjustifiable failure to perfect a direct appeal, or raise the issue on direct appeal (CPL 440.10 [2] [a], [c]; see People u Hamilton, 115 AD3d 12, 20 [2014]). In this case, there was no appeal from the judgment, and the claims supporting the defendant\u2019s motions involve matter both on and off the record. Therefore, the proper procedural course for the defendant was a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (see People v Diallo, 113 AD3d 199 [2013]; People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2011]).\nA defendant seeking to vacate a judgment of conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel need not submit an affidavit or affirmation from his or her former attorney attesting to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness (see People v Radcliffe, 298 AD2d 533, 534-535 [2002]; accord People v Washington, 128 AD3d 1397, 1399 [2015]). Moreover, here, the defendant submitted an explanation for his failure to submit affirmations from his former attorneys (see People v Morales, 58 NY2d 1008, 1009 [1983]), and some support for the defendant\u2019s allegations may be found in Middler\u2019s statement on the record at the plea proceeding indicating that deportation was only a \u201cpossibility.\u201d\nIn Padilla v Kentucky (559 US 356 [2010]), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires criminal defense counsel to advise their noncitizen clients about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea. However, that decision is not applied retroactively to state court postconviction proceedings (see People v Baret, 23 NY3d 777, 781 [2014]). Since the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction became final when his time to take an appeal expired \u2014 long before Padilla was decided in 2010 \u2014 Padilla is not applicable here. Therefore, \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to warn a defendant that a guilty plea might lead to removal from the United States\u201d (People v Baret, 23 NY3d at 785) does not, in this case, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\nHowever, \u201cinaccurate advice about a guilty plea\u2019s immigration consequences constitute[s]\u201d ineffective assistance of counsel (id.; see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 111 [2003]). In McDonald, the defendant was advised that his conviction, upon his plea of guilty, would not result in his deportation (see id. at 115). Here, the defendant allegedly was advised that his conviction carried the \u201cpossibility\u201d of deportation, and the Supreme Court, citing People v Argueta (46 AD3d 46 [2007]), concluded that this advice did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. In Argueta, the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to possession of cocaine, while not an aggravated felony in and of itself, became an aggravated felony because of the defendant\u2019s prior record. Counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in that case was his failure to \u201cquantify the possibility or likelihood of deportation\u201d (id. at 49), which he was not required to do. In this case, on the other hand, deportation was mandatory at the time the defendant entered his plea of guilty based upon the offense itself (see 8 USC \u00a7 1101 [a] [43]).\nIn People v Galan (116 AD3d 787 [2014]), as in this case, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and was sentenced to a period of probation of five years. In 2010, the defendant was arrested on an unrelated charge, and ICE initiated removal proceedings on the ground that the crime was a deportable offense. At a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction, the defendant\u2019s former attorney testified that, in accordance with her general practice at the time, \u201cshe would have advised the defendant that he would be subject to deportation as a result of his guilty plea to a drug-related offense\u201d (id. at 789). This Court ruled that the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction should have been denied. In this case, on the other hand, the defendant claims he was advised that deportation was not likely, and no evidence was submitted to refute that claim.\nIn order to secure the vacatur of his judgment of conviction, the defendant must establish that there was \u201ca reasonable probability that, if counsel had informed him that he was certain to be deported as a result of his guilty plea, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial\u201d (People v Hernandez, 22 NY3d 972, 976 [2013]). Here, in addition to making the foregoing assertions in support of his motion, the defendant further claimed that if immigration consequences had been factored into the plea bargaining process, counsel might have been able to negotiate a different plea agreement that would not have resulted in automatic deportation (see People v Chacko, 99 AD3d 527, 527-528 [2012]). For example, if the defendant had pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, he would not have been subject to mandatory deportation (see Aguirre v Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 79 F3d 315 [1996]).\nIn view of the foregoing, the defendant sufficiently alleged that counsel provided incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences of his plea of guilty, and that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct, to warrant a hearing. Accordingly, the matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for a hearing (see People v Ricketts-Simpson, 130 AD3d 1149 [2015]; People v Reynoso, 88 AD3d 1162 [2011]) and a new determination thereafter of the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Leventhal, J.P., Roman, Hinds-Radix and Barros, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant appealed two orders from the Supreme Court, Queens County, which denied his motions to vacate a 2003 judgment of conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, citing ineffective assistance of counsel regarding immigration consequences of his guilty plea. The appellate court reversed the first order and vacated the second, remanding the case for a hearing, as the defendant sufficiently alleged that he received incorrect information about the mandatory deportation resulting from his plea. The appeal from the second order was dismissed as academic due to the remand for a new determination.</s>"}

Thereafter, he pleaded guilty in September 2003 to the criminal sale count in full satisfaction of all charges and, in return, it was agreed that defendant\u2019s sentencing would be adjourned in order for him to complete the \u201cRoad to Recovery Program,\u201d a substance abuse treatment program. According to the terms of the agreement, upon successful completion of the program, defendant would be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea and request dismissal of the superior court information. In signing the agreement, defendant specifically acknowledged that if he failed to complete any aspect of the program, he would receive a sentence within the range of dVa to 9 years to 121/2 to 25 years. Subsequently, defendant absconded from the program without completing his obligations. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest and he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison.\nInitially, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s various claims challenging the terms of the agreement. Significantly, \u201c[c]onditions imposed as part of a plea arrangement are valid if the parties agree to them and they do not violate any statute or contravene public policy\u201d (People v Avery, 85 NY2d 503, 507 [1995]). Here, the record establishes that defendant entered an intelligent, knowing and voluntary plea of guilty and there is no support for the argument that his planned participation in the Road to Recovery Frogram was coerced (see People v Juckett, 17 AD3d 867, 868 [2005]). Instead, the record reveals that defendant failed to abide by an explicit condition of his plea agreement, therefore, County Court was free to impose a sentence in accordance with its terms (see generally People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841, 842 [1993]).\nWe also do not agree with defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed by County Court was unduly harsh. Despite his argument that the court did not take into consideration his request for leniency, it is notable that the court did impose the minimum sentence contemplated under the plea agreement, namely 4V2 to 9 years. Furthermore, although defendant claims that County Court erred in not reducing his sentence in accordance with the Drug Law Reform Act, we note that his crimes were committed prior to that law\u2019s effective date and, therefore, said statute was not applicable (see People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676, 677 [2006]).\nWe have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.\nMercure, Crew III, Peters and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

Defendant argues that County Court abused its discretion in considering defendant\u2019s statement in which he denied possessing drugs as a factor in imposing the harshest possible sentence. Upon our review of the sentencing transcript, we do not find that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant. County Court considered the subject statement as indicative of defendant\u2019s lack of remorse for his actions. It also considered defendant\u2019s past criminal history and the nature of the crime.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nPeters, P.J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Cawley Jr., J.), rendered October 7, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nFollowing his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer on five separate occasions, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Prior to entering a guilty plea to the charged crimes, defendant applied for participation in the judicial diversion program (see CPL art 216). Following an evaluation and a hearing, County Court (Pelella, J.) denied defendant\u2019s request. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty as charged with the understanding that his sentence would be capped at six years of imprisonment followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court (Cawley Jr., J.) thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision upon each count of the indictment, with said sentences to run concurrently with one another. Defendant now appeals, contending that it was an abuse of discretion to deny his request for judicial diversion and, further, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nPreliminarily, to the extent that defendant suggests that the agency to which he was referred was not authorized to perform his alcohol and drug assessment, challenges the sufficiency of the evaluation actually performed and/or faults the People for failing to call the evaluator to testify at the hearing, we need note only that defendant failed to raise any objections in this regard at such hearing and, therefore, has failed to preserve these issues for our review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). Turning to the merits, \u201cunder the program created by CPL article 216, whether an eligible defendant will be offered judicial diversion pursuant to that article remains within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and [a] defendant is not automatically entitled to judicial diversion\u201d (People v Meddaugh, 150 AD3d 1545, 1547 [2017]; see CPL 216.05 [4]; People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d 1157, 1159 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]; People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2013]; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]). Pursuant to the statute, CPL 216.05 required County Court (Pelella, J.)\u2014upon completion of the underlying hearing\u2014to consider and make findings of fact as to whether defendant was eligible for participation in the judicial diversion program, whether he had a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependance, whether such abuse or dependence was a contributing factor to his criminal behavior, whether his participation in the program could effectively address such abuse or dependence and, finally, whether confinement was or might be necessary for the protection of the public (see CPL 216.05 [3] [b] [i]-[v]; People v Cora, 135 AD3d 987, 989 [2016]).\nAlthough County Court deemed defendant to be eligible for participation in the judicial diversion program and concluded that defendant indeed \u201cmay have a history of alcohol or substance abuse,\u201d the court nonetheless denied defendant\u2019s application, finding that any such history was \u201cnot a contributing factor to . . . defendant\u2019s criminal behavior.\u201d Defendant now argues that County Court erred in neglecting to address the remaining statutory factors and, in any event, abused its discretion in denying his application for participation in the judicial diversion program. We disagree. Even assuming, without deciding, that County Court indeed was required to consider and make express findings as to each of the enumerated statutory factors, we nonetheless do not find that the court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for judicial diversion. Simply put, given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, which includes a conviction for a violent felony, the record does not reflect any basis upon which to conclude that granting defendant\u2019s request for judicial diversion would have been appropriate (see People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d at 1159; People v Powell, 110 AD3d at 1384).\nAs for defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed, defendant was promised that his sentence would be capped at six years of imprisonment, and he ultimately was sentenced to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Upon reviewing the record, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Georges, 151 AD3d 1402, 1403 [2017]).\nGarry, Mulvey, Aarons and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014Lahtinen, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Lomanto, J.), rendered December 20, 1999, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was indicted on five counts of varying degrees of criminal possession of a controlled substance, one of which was a class A-I felony. Pursuant to a plea bargain, and after some initial protestations of innocence which prompted further inquiry, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the entire indictment. He was thereafter sentenced to the agreed-upon concurrent prison terms, which included a term of six years to life on the class A-I felony. Upon subsequently learning that the sentence on the class A-I felony was illegal because a minimum sentence of lh years to life was required (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]), County Court vacated defendant\u2019s conviction of that crime only and, in its place, attempted to allocate a plea to a reduced class A-II felony drug possession crime. Although defendant stated that he wanted to plead guilty to the reduced crime, he denied possessing any drugs and repudiated his prior admissions upon which the original plea was based. Nevertheless, based upon those earlier admissions, County Court accepted defendant\u2019s plea to the reduced crime and imposed a prison sentence of six years to life to run concurrently with the remaining terms previously imposed. Defendant appeals only from the judgment which resentenced him.\n\u201cWhere the plea bargain includes a sentence which is illegal because the minimum imposed is less than that required by law, this Court has held that the proper remedy is to vacate the sentence and afford the defendant, having been denied the benefit of the bargain, the opportunity to withdraw the plea\u201d (People v Martin, 278 AD2d 743, 744 [citation omitted]). Inasmuch as the entire sentence is \u201cpart and parcel of the plea bargain,\u201d it must be vacated in its entirety regardless of whether portions of the sentence are legal (People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941). The question posed by this appeal is whether vacatur of the entire sentence and offering defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea is the only proper remedy. We conclude that it is not.\nThe principles underlying the rule stated in People v Martin (supra) can be found in People v McConnell (49 NY2d 340), where the Court of Appeals explained that \u201cin most instances when a guilty plea has been induced by an unfulfilled promise either the plea must be vacated or the promise honored, but * * * the choice rests in the discretion of the sentencing court\u201d (id., at 346). Accordingly, where the sentence imposed pursuant to a plea bargain is illegal because it is greater than that permitted by law, the sentencing court can reduce the sentence without affording the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea, provided that the reduced sentence gives the defendant the full benefit of the plea bargain (compare, People v Henderson, 145 AD2d 676, lv denied 73 NY2d 978, with People v Martin, supra). In this case, County Court reduced the top count of the indictment, with the apparent consent of the People, so that the sentence upon which the plea bargain was based could legally be imposed. In these circumstances, the full benefit of the plea bargain remained intact and, therefore, we see no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s remedy, which effectively honored that bargain.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s claim that his \u201cprotestations of innocence at resentencing requires a different conclusion. When defendant initially appeared for his plea, he made numerous statements which negated one or more essential elements of the crimes charged in the indictment and County Court, with the assistance of defense counsel and the Assistant District Attorney, conducted a thorough inquiry in accordance with the requirements of People v Lopez (71 NY2d 662). As a result of this inquiry, defendant voluntarily admitted the elements of the crimes. His subsequent protestations of innocence at resentencing raised the same issues that had been fully explored during the earlier allocution and, despite the protestations of innocence, defendant not only failed to seek to withdraw his earlier plea, he also stated that he wanted to plead guilty to the reduced charge in place of the class A-I felony so that he could receive the bargained-for sentence. In these circumstances, there is no basis to disturb the judgment.\nCardona, P. J., Crew III, Spain and Rose JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The court affirmed the County Court's resentencing of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance after vacating an illegal sentence related to a class A-I felony. Despite the defendant's later protestations of innocence, the court determined that he had previously made valid admissions under a thorough inquiry and voluntarily accepted a plea to a reduced class A-II felony. The court held that the remedy of reducing the sentence while maintaining the plea bargain was appropriate, thus upholding the defendant's resentencing.</s>"}

In accordance with a plea bargain, defendant disposed of both indictments with a plea of guilty to a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a predicate felony offender to a prison term of 9 to 18 years.\nThereafter, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction. The sole evidence in support of the motion was defendant\u2019s own affidavit, in which he stated that he had no contact with his assigned counsel from the July 9, 1992 arraignment until counsel came to see him on November 21, 1992 to advise him of the impending trial of the indictments and of the People\u2019s offer of a negotiated plea. Although he was innocent of the charges and had a valid defense, defendant continues, confronted with his counsel\u2019s insistence and fearing that his counsel was not prepared for trial, defendant reluctantly accepted the proposed plea bargain. Finally, defendant states that, in order to induce County Court to accept his plea and thereby avoid trial, he falsely indicated at the plea proceeding that he was satisfied with the job his counsel had done, that nobody had pressured or coerced him into pleading guilty, that he did not wish to discuss the matter any further with anyone, and that he had been allowed sufficient time to reflect on the matter. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals the judgment of conviction and, by permission, the denial of his CPL article 440 motion.\nWe conclude that defendant\u2019s self-serving and conclusory averments, which are unsupported by any other affidavit or evidence and which are directly contradicted, first, by the representations defendant made to County Court at the time of entry of his guilty plea and, second, by the record before us, evidencing counsel\u2019s thorough pretrial motion practice and negotiations and the highly advantageous plea bargain brought about as a result, did not warrant a hearing on the CPL article 440 motion (see, CPL 440.30 [4] [b], [c], [d]; People v Shamblee, 222 AD2d 834, 835; People v Edison, 192 AD2d 789, lv denied 83 NY2d 966). Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is the underpinning for the argument that he did not enter a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of his right to appeal, our determination that defendant was provided with meaningful representation consistent with his constitutional rights (see, People v Shamblee, supra; People v Frayer, 215 AD2d 862, 864, lv denied 86 NY2d 794) is dispositive of the direct appeal as well.\nMikoll, J.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Siedlecki, J.), rendered June 10, 1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree. 11 After defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment. Sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement and defendant received a term of incarceration of 120 days, to be served intermittently, and a fine of $10,000. This appeal followed. H In light of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Oliver v United States (466 US_, 52 USLW 4425), which reaffirmed the open fields doctrine (see Hester v United States, 265 US 57), we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the search of his property and the seizure of the marihuana plants discovered there violated the Fourth Amendment. This being so, the material seized following the execution of the subsequent search warrant cannot be suppressed as the product of previous illegal searches and seizures. 11 We are of the view, however, that the fine imposed is not legally permissible. A fine greater than $5,000 can be imposed for a felony, such as attempted criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree (see Penal Law, \u00a7 110.05, subd 5; \u00a7 221.30), only when the defendant derives a \u201cgain\u201d from the commission of the crime (Penal Law, \u00a7 80.00, subds 1, 2) and only after County Court makes a finding as to the amount of the \u201cgain\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 80.00, subd 3). It is conceded that County Court did not make such a finding and it is clear that any gain was nullified by the seizure of the marihuana by the police (Penal Law, \u00a7 80.00, subd 2). Accordingly, a $5,000 fine was the maximum which could have been legally imposed and County Court was powerless to impose a greater fine, notwithstanding the plea agreement (see People v Grant, 92 AD2d 985). Although this error was not raised below, this court cannot permit a sentence which is invalid as a matter of law to stand (see CPL 470.15, subd 2, par [c]; People v Grant, supra). Because the fine must be reduced, the District Attorney must be afforded an opportunity to withdraw from the plea agreement (see People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 307-308; People v Ciccone, 91 AD2d 688, 689-690; see, also, Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 220.10, p 206).

H Judgment reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to County Court of Tioga County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. Kane, J. P., Main, Casey, Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appeal concerns a conviction for attempted criminal possession of marihuana, following a guilty plea and a sentence that included a $10,000 fine, which was deemed excessive.

The appeal regarding the harshness of the sentence was also dismissed due to the valid appeal waiver.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014 Harris, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Lomanto, J.), rendered July 24, 1984, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nThe issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s plea of guilty should be set aside on the ground that it was not voluntarily and intelligently entered into by him. Defendant asserts that the terms of the plea bargain were not made clear to him and that he was under duress at the time he pleaded guilty. Defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree was made in full satisfaction of the numerous charges pending against him.\nIt is well established that a defendant must have knowledge and understanding of the consequences of his plea and that a plea may be vacated if it was coerced or the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the consequences was not adequately explored (Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57, 63-64; see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17). Defendant asserts that at the time he agreed to the plea arrangement it was not clear whether the charges pending against him in Schenectady County were covered by the plea. However, in response to defendant\u2019s inquiry about the Schenectady County charges, County Court clarified any doubts by unequivocally responding \"yes> they are dropped\u201d. Further, defendant has not alleged that he has been prosecuted on those charges and, thus, even assuming there was an ambiguity, defendant has not shown that he was prejudiced by it.\nDefendant\u2019s argument that he was coerced to accept the plea is apparently based on his contention that County Court set his bail excessively high which prevented him from visiting his terminally ill mother. This argument is belied by the fact that the record is devoid of any evidence indicating that the court was aware of the condition of defendant\u2019s mother prior to the time defendant accepted the plea agreement. Indeed, there is every indication that defendant had made tentative arrangements to meet bail by the time his plea was entered. He could have thus refrained from entering his guilty plea and proceeded with a bail application. Upon review of the record, and particularly the plea colloquy, it is evident that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement (see, People v Price, 105 AD2d 557, 559).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Weiss, Mikoll and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Fulton County regarding the defendant's guilty plea for criminal sale of a controlled substance was denied, as the court found that the plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently. The defendant's claims of unclear plea terms and coercion due to high bail were dismissed; the court clarified any ambiguities about pending charges, and there was no evidence that the court was aware of the defendant's mother's condition prior to the plea. Consequently, the judgment was affirmed.</s>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\n\u2014Crew III, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered March 16, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nIn December 1998, following his arrest on several drug-related charges, defendant entered a plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to time served and a five-year term of probation. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant agreed to enter a drug treatment facility, and County Court warned him that if he left the program prior to sentencing, he could be sentenced to the maximum term of 2V3 to 7 years in prison. Nevertheless, defendant left the program, failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing and, in August 1999, was arrested in New York County on a number of serious charges. In satisfaction of those charges, he ultimately entered a plea of guilty of robbery in the first degree and was sentenced to a five-year determinate prison term. While serving that term, he was returned to County Court in March 2000 for sentencing and the court imposed the 21/s to 7-year maximum term consecutive to the determinate term. Defendant appeals.\nCiting his age of 20 and lack of a criminal record when he committed the instant offense, defendant contends that the sentence was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Despite defendant\u2019s youth and lack of criminal record, the presentence report reveals that defendant admitted to having been barred from one high school as a troublemaker, never having been employed and having supported a lifestyle that included marihuana use and alcohol abuse by selling drugs. In addition, defendant\u2019s youth and lack of a criminal record were taken into account when he was accorded a substantial measure of leniency by County Court\u2019s agreement to the probationary term of the plea bargain. Defendant clearly was warned that his receipt of this leniency was conditional and that he faced the maximum term in prison if he left the drug treatment program prior to sentencing. Defendant subsequently not only left the drug treatment program and failed to appear for sentencing, but also engaged in additional serious criminal activity that resulted in a prison term. We see no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed, and the record contains no mitigating factors that would warrant a sentence any less harsh than that imposed. Nor is there anything in the record to demonstrate that defendant should have been accorded the benefit of concurrent sentencing (see, People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305). In these circumstances, we also reject defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing by counsel\u2019s failure to emphasize defendant\u2019s youth and lack of a prior criminal record.\nCardona, P. J., Spain, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The County Court of Rensselaer County affirmed the conviction of a defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree after he failed to comply with the conditions of his plea agreement, which included entering a drug treatment facility. Despite arguments regarding his age and lack of a prior criminal record, the court found no abuse of discretion in imposing the maximum sentence of 2\u00bd to 7 years in prison, especially given the defendant's subsequent criminal activities and failure to appear for sentencing. The court also rejected claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCardona, P. J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered December 21, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of five years to life imprisonment following acceptance of his guilty plea. Defendant contends that County Court coerced his guilty plea by threatening to revoke the plea bargain offer made two months earlier unless defendant accepted it by the end of the business day and by indicating the imposition of a greater sentence after trial. The argument is not preserved for appeal inasmuch as defendant neither moved to withdraw his guilty plea nor to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Ryan, 191 AD2d 814). In any event, the record clearly indicates that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909) and without any protest of innocence.\nThe offer of five years to life that encompassed two distinct class A-II felonies, as well as a separate class B felony, was made on September 4, 1992. Defendant, through counsel, rejected that offer on September 25, 1992 when he made a counteroffer to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of three years to life. When defendant appeared in court on November 16, 1992, sufficient time had elapsed for him to have considered the plea bargain. By that time, County Court had rendered a decision on defendant\u2019s pretrial omnibus motion and scheduled the case for trial. Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to condition the proffered plea bargain on defendant\u2019s acceptance of it before the end of business that day.\nFurthermore, unlike People v Christian (139 AD2d 896, lv denied 71 NY2d 1024), the record here lacks an explicit threat to give defendant a heavier sentence if he exercised his right to trial. County Court\u2019s statements informed defendant that consecutive sentences were legally permissible upon multiple convictions. Although defendant again expressed his general dissatisfaction with representation of his attorney at the time of the plea and stated that he had recently mailed a pro se motion seeking the assignment of new counsel, he elected not to pursue that issue. Instead, defendant accepted the plea bargain negotiated by the Public Defender\u2019s office which substantially limited his exposure to imprisonment (see, People v Reeves, 199 AD2d 566).\nCrew III, Casey, Weiss and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nCounty Court had recently heard and denied a motion by defendant to have new counsel assigned. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court's judgment, which convicted the defendant of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance and sentenced him to five years to life imprisonment, was affirmed. The defendant argued that his guilty plea was coerced due to threats regarding the plea bargain and potential sentencing; however, the court found that these arguments were not preserved for appeal as he did not move to withdraw the plea. The record indicated that the plea was entered voluntarily and knowingly, and the court's conditions for the plea bargain were deemed reasonable given the circumstances.</s>"}

In full satisfaction of both indictments, she pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and forgery in the second degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was told that the sentence would be consecutive terms of one year in the local jail for each conviction. Prior to sentencing, County Court received a presentence investigation report which recommended, in the event that defendant were determined not to be a second felony offender, imposition of a split sentence of incarceration in the local jail and probation. As defendant was not found to be a second felony offender, County Court sentenced her in accordance with the plea agreement.\nDefendant now appeals, asserting that her guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent essentially because, at the time she entered the plea, she did not know that the presentence investigation report would recommend a split sentence instead of incarceration. Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw her plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, she has not preserved this claim for our review (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662; People v Benjamin, 296 AD2d 666, 667). Significantly, at the sentencing hearing when defendant expressed disappointment with the sentence imposed, County Court offered her the opportunity to withdraw the plea, an offer of which defendant did not avail herself.\nNevertheless, were we to consider defendant\u2019s claim, we would find it to be without any merit. During the plea proceedings, defense counsel advised County Court that defendant wished to accept the plea offer which defendant understood included the imposition of consecutive terms of one-year local jail time for each crime; defendant expressly confirmed her desire to so plead. While County Court indicated that defendant would be afforded the opportunity to withdraw her plea if the presentence investigation report recommended state prison time, no such offer was extended in the event the report recommended a split sentence. That the report recommended a sentence less than that to which defendant agreed does not render the guilty plea involuntary or unknowing since defendant received the benefit of her bargain. Accordingly, defendant asserts no viable reason to disturb the judgment of conviction.\nMercure, J.P., Crew III, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and forgery in the second degree after she pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement. The defendant claimed her plea was not knowing or voluntary because she was unaware that the presentence investigation report recommended a split sentence instead of incarceration; however, this claim was not preserved for review since she did not withdraw her plea. The Court found that the plea was valid as the defendant received the benefit of her agreement and was aware of the terms at the time of her plea.</s>"}

Following a Huntley hearing on February 1, 1985, County Court denied a motion to suppress defendant\u2019s written statement and certain physical evidence. Plea negotiations began after the commencement of jury selection on February 19, 1985. The prosecution started its case on February 21, 1985. On March 1, 1985, after a week of trial, the prosecution called Michael Melvin Ackerman as a rebuttal witness. His testimony was objected to by defendant because Ackerman had not been listed on the prosecution\u2019s witness list. After hearing defense counsel on this witness\u2019s eligibility to testify and before making a decision thereon, County Court was approached by the parties with a plea bargain arrangement. This arrangement required defendant to plead guilty to a class B felony charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with a \"clear allocution of the B felony and the crime\u201d and with defendant \"withdrawing * * * all motions and objections\u201d. In exchange for his plea, defendant was to be sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 9 years. The prosecution was required to disclose Ackerman\u2019s testimony by an offer of proof, since Ackerman had not yet testified. After the prosecution did so, defendant, with his attorney present, pleaded guilty to the second count of the indictment and placed the plea agreement on the record. Specifically, defendant stated that he would withdraw all of his motions and objections, that he understood that his plea waived certain of his legal defenses including entrapment, and that the plea was entered into expressly and affirmatively after consultation with counsel. Defendant then admitted the underlying facts of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.\nPursuant to County Court\u2019s direction, defendant appeared for sentencing on March 27, 1985. Inasmuch as a confidential informant for the People, Donald Warner, had appeared before the court on his own initiative that morning and had made an unsworn statement, defense counsel was given an adjournment to assess the impact of Warner\u2019s statement. On April 19, 1985, defendant and his counsel again appeared for sentencing and at this time defense counsel made a lengthy oral motion to withdraw defendant\u2019s plea on the basis of the unsworn statement of Warner and on the offer of proof of Ackerman. Based on the plea bargain and its conclusion that defense counsel had always had access to the witness Warner and that the subsequent unsworn statement of Warner did not substantially alter his trial testimony, and because any objection thereto had been waived by the plea, County Court denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. After affording defendant the opportunity to speak on his own behalf, which was declined, the court sentenced defendant to the term promised.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent plea waived all the factual defenses he could have interposed at trial (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1), including the defense of entrapment (see, People v Richards, 89 AD2d 1043). The plea agreement was favorable to defendant (see, People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 353, cert denied sub nom. Robinson v New York, 393 US 1067), who could have received 8 Vs to 25 years in prison for a conviction of each of the class B felony charges and 8Vs years to life on the class A-l felony charge.\nFurthermore, in our view, despite ample opportunity to be heard on the withdrawal of his plea (see, People v Luke UU., 99 AD2d 881), defendant never protested his innocence (see, People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55, 57; People v Johnson, 91 AD2d 782, 783) or complained of the adequacy of his counsel (see, People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940, 941) or the excessiveness of his sentence (see, People v Nixon, supra). Instead, he fully and frankly admitted his guilt of the crime to which he pleaded guilty without indicating any \"trigger\u201d requiring the court to make further inquiry in regard thereto. Therefore, County Court properly exercised its discretion in summarily denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (cf. People v Brockway, 88 AD2d 1039), since there was no adequate basis for the withdrawal motion (see, People v Johnson, supra). The judgment of conviction should in all respects be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Casey, Mikoll and Yesawich, Jr., JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based on his guilty plea. The defendant had initially faced multiple charges but entered a plea agreement after jury selection began, agreeing to withdraw all motions in exchange for a reduced sentence of 3 to 9 years. The court found that the defendant's plea was made knowingly and intelligently, waiving any defenses, and denied his subsequent motion to withdraw the plea, concluding there was no adequate basis for such withdrawal.</s>"}

However, at defense counsel\u2019s suggestion, both the court and the prosecution agreed that if the defendant was able to repay the $3,600 that he had obtained from the police in connection with the charged drug sales he would receive a lesser sentence of 4 years to life imprisonment. Since the defendant was unable to produce the $3,600, the court imposed the promised sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment.\nWe reject the defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is excessive or that the court unconstitutionally imposed a greater sentence because the defendant is indigent (see generally, Bearden v Georgia, 461 US 660; Tate v Short, 401 US 395). Rather, the record clearly reflects that the defendant simply received the bargained-for sentence and that he was unable to take advantage of an opportunity to lessen his sentence.

Defendant\u2019s probation was revoked in April 2007, at which time he was resentenced to 365 days in jail. In the interim, defendant was charged in two separate indictments with criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and criminal pos session of stolen property in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of both indictments and in exchange for prison terms of 1\u00bd years plus one year of postrelease supervision on the drug charge and 1\u00bd to 3 years on the stolen property charge, with those sentences to run concurrently. Defendant also waived his right to appeal. Although County Court subsequently sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the promised prison terms, it ordered that the negotiated sentences run consecutive to any undischarged sentence that defendant owed on the prior probation violation. Defendant now appeals, contending that the failure to advise him that the negotiated sentences would run consecutive to the undischarged sentence warrants vacatur of his plea.\nWe agree. Preliminarily, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Walker, 47 AD3d 965, 966 [2008]). Further, because defendant was not apprised prior to sentencing that his negotiated sentences would run consecutive to his undischarged sentence, his challenge to \u201cthe validity of his plea is not precluded due to his failure to raise this issue in a postallocution motion\u201d (People v Tausinger, 55 AD3d 956, 957 [2008]; cf. People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]; People v Rivera, 51 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2008]).\nTurning to the merits, \u201ca knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea requires that a defendant be informed as to the full extent of the exposure he faces upon sentencing\u201d (People v Tausinger, 55 AD3d at 957). The record reflects that no mention of the undischarged sentence was made at defendant\u2019s plea allocution or at any point prior to sentencing.

The charges stemmed from two separate incidents, one on March 7, 1986 and the other on March 13, 1986, and as a result were contained in two separate indictments. Just before jury selection on the day set for trial, defendant requested the appointment of a new attorney to represent him. His request was denied due to its lateness. Thereupon, defendant indicated his willingness to accept the plea bargain previously offered him. This agreement permitted defendant to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale in the fifth degree and one count of criminal possession in the fifth degree, and to have a further charge then pending against him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree dismissed, in exchange for the imposition of concurrent prison sentences of 3 Vi to 7 years on each count. In the course of reciting the terms of the plea bargain for the record, the Assistant District Attorney stated that if convicted of the charges, defendant would be required to receive consecutive sentences, since the crimes were committed a week apart. The prosecution concedes on this appeal that such statement was error. Defendant now urges that the statement induced his plea and was coercive, that he should have been assigned new counsel, and that the sentence imposed, although in accordance with the plea bargain, was harsh and excessive.\nThe record reveals that defendant made no motion to withdraw his plea at the time of his sentencing; nor did defendant ever demonstrate good cause why new counsel should have been assigned to him on the day scheduled for trial, which was over 16 months after his indictment. In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for new counsel (see, People v Tineo, 64 NY2d 531, 536-537; People v Medina, 44 NY2d 199, 207-208).\nIn regard to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law relating to consecutive sentences, we find it significant that defendant had indicated a willingness to accept the plea bargain before the misstatement was made, and defendant never questioned the statement or stated that he felt compelled by it or that he was relying on it in entering his plea of guilty. Defendant was at all times represented by competent counsel. The plea bargain he received was fair and favorable in all respects, and at the time of sentencing defendant must have so considered it since he made no effort to withdraw his plea.\nWe find that the plea was freely and voluntarily made by defendant and that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive. The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Casey, J. P., Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., Mercure and Harvey, JJ., concur. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, following a guilty plea as part of a plea bargain.

Overall, the court concluded that the plea was made freely and voluntarily, and the imposed sentence was appropriate.</s>"}
{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nCrew III, J.P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered October 13, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was indicted on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree stemming from a cocaine sale in the Town of Union, Broome County. Defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge in satisfaction of the instant indictment, other outstanding charges and a possible perjury charge arising from his grand jury testimony and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of six years to be followed by a D/a-year period of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that his plea was fatally \u201cvague and insufficient\u201d because his plea made out both the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1])\u2014the charge to which he was entering his guilty plea\u2014and the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.31). Simply put, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree is a lesser included offense of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Baxton, 302 AD2d 401, 402 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]) and, by definition, \u201cit is impossible to commit [the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree] without concomitantly committing, by the same conduct, [the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree]\u201d (CPL 1.20 [37]; see People v Glover, 57 NY2d 61, 63-64 [1982]). Consequently, defendant\u2019s plea to the greater charge necessarily satisfied the elements of the lesser charge, and his claim that this requires vacatur is patently meritless. In his plea allocution, defendant clearly and unequivocally admitted to knowingly selling a narcotic drug\u2014cocaine\u2014and, as such, we decline to disturb his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nNext, inasmuch as he has not moved to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant\u2019s contention that he was coerced into pleading guilty is unpreserved for our review (see People v Martinez, 40 AD3d 1309, 1310 [2007]; People v Harris, 308 AD2d 659, 659-660 [2003]). In any event, defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. Defendant asserts that he was coerced into pleading guilty because the People were contemplating bringing a perjury charge against him based upon his grand jury testimony if he did not accept the plea. First, we note that the record demonstrates that it was defendant, not the People, who raised this issue when he declared that he \u201cwant[ed] to make sure that any uncharged criminal activity . . . will be wrapped up in satisfaction of this guilty plea,\u201d and that defendant also stated that he was not forced or pressured \u201cin any way\u201d into pleading guilty. Even so, the fact that the People\u2019s promise to refrain from further prosecution may have induced defendant to plead guilty did not, under the circumstances, \u201crender defendant\u2019s acceptance of the plea involuntary by reason of duress or coercion\u201d (People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 770 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 919 [1996]; see People v France [Jenkins], 241 AD2d 525 [1997], lvs denied 91 NY2d 873, 875 [1997]; People v Winchenbaugh, 120 AD2d 811, 813 [1986]; see also People v Anderson [Anderson-Fialkow], 270 AD2d 509, 510 [2000], lvs denied 95 NY2d 792, 793 [2000]; People v Brown, 239 AJD2d 784, 784-785 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 870 [1997]).\nFinally, the record belies defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary based upon the fact that he may have been experiencing pain at the time of his plea due to his ocular disability. Upon defendant\u2019s declaration that he was in pain, County Court inquired further to insure that he understood the nature of his plea and its consequences, and we discern no basis upon which to disturb it (see People v Harris, 308 AD2d at 660; People v McCann, 289 AD2d 703, 703-704 [2001]).\nPeters, Spain, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, rejecting his claims that his guilty plea was vague and insufficient, coerced, or involuntary due to pain from an ocular disability. The court found that the plea clearly met the elements of the charged offense and that the defendant's assertions lacked merit, as he had not moved to withdraw his plea and had acknowledged understanding the plea's implications.</s>"}

At sentencing, defense counsel submitted extensive information regarding defendant\u2019s abusive childhood, long-standing drug abuse and serious physical and mental ailments. County Court observed that those circumstances would have led it to impose a lesser sentence were it not for the plea agreement. Defense counsel also recognized that the court\u2019s \u201chands were tied\u201d by the plea agreement and did not request a lesser sentence. County Court then sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the bargained-for term of imprisonment.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Given County Court\u2019s observations, we are constrained to note that it is, of course, settled law that a sentencing court retains the right, in the exercise of its discretion, to determine that a bargained-for sentence is inappropriate and is \u201cfree to impose a lesser penalty if warranted\u201d (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 308 [1981]). Here, however, defense counsel and County Court undoubtedly were aware that if the court had agreed to impose a lesser sentence, the People would have been entitled to withdraw their consent to the plea agreement (see id. at 307-308; People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822, 823 [1989]), a possibility that defendant herself was unwilling to face. As for defendant\u2019s contention that a reduction in the interest of justice is warranted, our review of the record does not lead us to conclude that the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant a reduction in the bargained-for sentence (see e.g. People v Brown, 3 AD3d 593 [2004]; People v Perez, 181 AD2d 922 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 836 [1992]; People v Brandow, 139 AD2d 819 [1988], lv denied 72 NY2d 856 [1988]).\nMercure, J.P., Feters, Spain, Carpinello and Rose, JJ., concur.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nLynch, J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Ames, J.), rendered October 1, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nFollowing an investigation by the Attorney General\u2019s Statewide Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and George Macon were charged in a superceding indictment with conspiracy in the fourth degree and other drug-related felonies stemming from the distribution of cocaine in 2012. Following extensive negotiations, defendant accepted a plea agreement pursuant to which he waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under counts 1 and 3 of the indictment, respectively, in satisfaction of all charges. He was sentenced, consistent with the plea agreement, to time served on each of the convictions, approximately one year in jail, to be served concurrently. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea, a claim that survives his uncontested waiver of the right to appeal but which is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review given his failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Hudson, 130 AD3d 1320, 1320 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here, as defendant did not make any statements during his ultimate plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Hare, 110 AD3d 1117, 1117 [2013]). Although County Court\u2019s initial attempts to complete a plea allocution were halted due to defendant\u2019s reluctance to implicate Macon or to admit certain overt acts alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy, after two adjournments, defense counsel assured the court that defendant \u201cunderstands his rights.\u201d Defendant thereafter allocuted, without qualification, to the conspiracy charge, including sufficient overt acts, and also admitted to the possession charge and, during both allocutions, made no statements suggestive of innocence or involuntariness. Further, prior to eliciting and accepting his guilty plea, the court adequately informed defendant of the trial-related rights that he was forfeiting as a consequence of the guilty plea, including \u201cthe privilege against self-incrimination and the rights to a jury trial and to be confronted by witnesses\u201d (People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013], citing Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]). As such, there is an \u201caffirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his constitutional rights\u201d (People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s specific claim that his plea was involuntary in that his factual admissions (although not his actual guilty plea) preceded County Court\u2019s advisement of the rights he would be forfeiting in connection with his guilty plea, we reiterate that it is the better practice to advise a pleading defendant of such rights \u201cprior to obtaining an admission to the charges and a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Mandiville, 84 AD3d 1644, 1645 n [2011]). We note that the Court of Appeals has held that, with regard to a trial court\u2019s failure to properly inform a defendant of the trial-related rights forfeited by a guilty plea, preservation is required \u201cdepending upon the particular circumstances of a case\u201d (People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]). Here, defendant failed to preserve this issue by making a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, despite the opportunity to do so in the months following his guilty plea and before sentencing (see id.). Given that defendant was advised of his trial-related rights during two arraign ments and only entered a guilty plea after he was fully advised of the rights that he was forgoing by his plea, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6]). Defendant\u2019s remaining claims have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr. and Clark, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The Court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of conspiracy in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea as part of a plea agreement. The defendant's challenge to the voluntariness of his plea was deemed unpreserved for review due to his failure to make a postallocution motion, and the court found no inconsistencies or indications of involuntariness in his allocution. The court also noted that the defendant had been adequately informed of his rights prior to entering his plea, thus rejecting his claims.</s>"}

As a part of the plea agreement, defendant agreed to pay restitution in a specified sum and waived his right to appeal. Following a sentencing hearing, County Court sentenced defendant to five years\u2019 probation, 120 days in jail, the agreed-upon restitution and 50 hours of community service. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant contends that his guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal were coerced by the ineffective assistance of his counsel and other surrounding circumstances. Although defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal does not in and of itself preclude our review (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1), defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders defendant\u2019s arguments unpreserved for our review (see, People v Smith, 271 AD2d 752, 753; People v Russell, 237 AD2d 841, 842, lv denied 90 NY2d 897). Nonetheless, were we to review the arguments, we would find them to be lacking in merit. Our review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal with the benefit of meaningful assistance from his counsel (see, People v Ireland, 274 AD2d 743; People v Victor, 262 AD2d 872, 873, lv denied 94 NY2d 830).\nTurning to the legality of the sentence imposed, defendant contends, and the People concede, that County Court improperly imposed a sentence of community service. Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) (h) permits a sentence of community service for a class E felony conviction only where \u201cthe defendant has consented to the amount and conditions of such service.\u201d Defendant\u2019s consent to the possibility of community service may not be inferred from the plea allocution and the record is otherwise devoid of any indication that defendant actually consented to the terms and conditions of community service imposed at the time of sentencing. Accordingly, the sentence of community service was not authorized and the matter must be remitted for resentencing (see, People v Tice, 267 AD2d 504, 505; People v Suros, 209 AD2d 203, lv denied 85 NY2d 943, cert denied 516 US 862).\nMercure, J.

Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of St. Lawrence County for resentencing; and, as so modified, affirmed. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court's judgment, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree, was partially successful. Although the court found that the defendant's guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily with effective counsel, it agreed that the imposition of community service was improper due to the lack of the defendant\u2019s consent to its terms. Consequently, the court vacated the community service sentence and remitted the case for resentencing.</s>"}

Two weeks prior to the scheduled sentencing date, defendant completed service of the equivalent of the proposed four-month jail term and County Court released him on his own recognizance after he expressly agreed that if he failed to appear for sentencing, or was charged with committing another crime in the interim, he would be sentenced as an adult to a potential prison term of 5 to 15 years. Defendant thereafter failed to appear for sentencing due to his arrest on charges of robbery in the first and second degrees in Kings County. He ultimately pleaded guilty to robbery in the third degree in satisfaction of those charges and was returned to Broome County. County Court then found that his arrest and guilty plea in Kings County constituted a violation of the conditions imposed upon his release and sentenced him to 5 to 15 years, in prison.\nOn his appeal, defendant makes only two arguments. First, he contends that County Court improperly refused to conduct a hearing as to his claim of innocence of the Kings County charges. We disagree. Inasmuch as defendant pleaded guilty to the intervening Kings County charges and advised County Court that he had no intention of moving to withdraw that guilty plea, there was no issue of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing as to whether he had violated the conditions of his release (see People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713, 714 [2000]). Second, defendant argues that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Despite defendant\u2019s lack of a prior criminal history, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention given his awareness of the consequences for violating the release conditions imposed and his undisturbed plea of guilty to a felony committed while on release (see People v Peguero, 7 AD3d 925, 925-926 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 661 [2004]; People v Gay, 305 AD2d 856, 856 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 620 [2003]; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, 880 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 879 [2000]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Crew III, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

He also waived his right to appeal in writing which he confirmed during the plea colloquy. County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 15 years to life on the criminal possession count and 3 to 9 years on the conspiracy count. The reduced sentencing provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 did not apply, as the crimes at issue were committed in 2004, before that Act became effective (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]; People v Utsey, 7 NY3d 398, 403-404 [2006]; People v Antoniou, 59 AD3d 805, 806 [2009]). Under the terms of the plea agreement and appeal waiver, however, defendant reserved the right to apply for resentencing as provided for by that Act (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 23; see also Penal Law \u00a7 70.71). It was further agreed that, if he did so, a determinate prison term of no more than 10 and no less than eight years, as well as post-release supervision, would be imposed on the criminal possession count. Upon defendant\u2019s subsequent application for resentencing, County Court imposed a prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of five years on the criminal possession count. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nIt is true, of course, that an appeal waiver executed in con-\nnection with a guilty plea does not preclude a challenge to the severity of a subsequent resentence if the plea was entered \u201cunder conditions that changed following the waiver\u201d (People v Tausinger, 21 AD3d 1181, 1183 [2005]; see People v Gray, 32 AD3d 1052, 1053 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 902 [2006]). In this case, however, when defendant entered into the plea agreement and executed the appeal waiver, while he did not know the precise prison term that would be imposed upon resentencing, he was fully aware of the agreed-upon potential sentence range that could be imposed thereat. Indeed, the written appeal waiver itself discloses the agreed-upon sentencing range that defendant faced at resentencing. As defendant \u201cknew the maximum exposure [he] could face upon pleading guilty,\u201d his valid appeal waiver precludes his present challenge to his resentence as harsh and excessive (People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 23; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]).\nMercure, J.P., Kavanagh, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

As so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and it is further,\nOrdered that the order is affirmed.\nThe errors complained of in the court\u2019s charge are unpreserved for appellate review (CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, the record indicates that the court gave sufficient instructions on the issues of identification and alibi when the charge is read as a whole (see, People v Victor, 62 NY2d 374; People v Whalen, 59 NY2d 273; cf People v Williams, 112 AD2d 177; People v Rodriguez, 111 AD2d 881), and that the charge adequately advised the jury of the legal principles applicable to the facts of the case so that the failure of the court to marshal the evidence was not error (CPL 300.10 [2]).\nNor did the trial court err in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the counts of the indictment pertaining to the sales of cocaine on June 11, 1981 and June 15, 1981, respectively. It was permissible to join the two sales since the offenses were \"the same or similar in law\u201d (CPL 200.20 [2] [c]). The defendant\u2019s motion was, therefore, addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion (CPL 200.20 [3]) and the defendant has not shown any basis upon which to conclude that the court\u2019s exercise of discretion was abused (see, People v Jenkins, 50 NY2d 981; People v Gilmore, 106 AD2d 399, 400).\nThe record indicates that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was far from inadequate. Counsel\u2019s pretrial Sandoval motion was granted, he vigorously cross-examined the People\u2019s witnesses, presented five alibi witnesses, and pressed the alibi defense in a thorough summation (see, People v Davidson, 123 AD2d 782; People v Fuentes, 111 AD2d 766, 767). While the defendant\u2019s attorney chose to fully explore the alibi defense and did not present certain other evidence available to him, we cannot say that the representation was rendered meaningless merely because his trial tactic was unsuccessful (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; cf. People v Ofunniyin, 114 AD2d 1045, 1047).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contention with respect to trial is unpreserved and, in any event, is without merit.\nFinally, the defendant\u2019s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated. Mollen, P. J., Bracken, Brown and Spatt, JJ., concur. [/INST] The defendant's appeal against her conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance was partially successful; the court reduced her sentence from two concurrent terms of 6 to 18 years to 3 to 9 years. The court affirmed the conviction, finding no errors in the jury instructions or in the trial court's decision not to sever the counts of the indictment. The defense counsel was deemed adequate despite the unsuccessful trial tactics, and the remaining claims were either unpreserved or without merit.</s>"}

Defendant appeals, contending that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, \u201cCounty Court was not obligated to expressly advise defendant of his right to contest the constitutionality of the prior conviction\u201d (People v Wilkins, 118 AD3d 1038, 1039 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Here, the record demonstrates that defendant was provided with the prior felony information at sentencing and, after a discussion with his counsel, affirmed that he did not contest the prior felony statement and admitted that he previously was convicted of that felony. Under these circumstances, County Court substantially complied with the requirements of CPL 400.21 (3) and properly sentenced defendant as a second felony offender (see id. at 1039; People v Wood, 108 AD3d 932, 933 [2013]).\nPeters, PJ., Lahtinen, Stein, Garry and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appeal from the County Court of Ulster County regarding the defendant's conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance was affirmed. The defendant argued he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender; however, the court found that he was adequately informed of his prior conviction and did not contest it, thus fulfilling the legal requirements for sentencing.</s>"}

In rejecting this argument, we note that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines, that the plea was in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment and that the sentence was in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Bauer, 153 AD2d 988, lv denied 75 NY2d 767; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Finally, we have previously determined that a person\u2019s affliction with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting interference with the sentence imposed (see, People v Brandow, 139 AD2d 819, lv denied 72 NY2d 856).\nWeiss, P.

Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the confidential informant\u2019s identification of him was denied and, thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. During the plea proceeding, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a comprehensive written waiver of that right. County Court sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 42/s to 9Vs years in prison. Defendant appeals and we now affirm.\nDefendant asserts that both his guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal were not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. This issue is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708 [2005]; see also People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685 [1993]). Moreover, this is not one of those rare instances in which \u201cdefendant\u2019s recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon [his] guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea\u201d such that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable (People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; see People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676-678 [1999]). In any event, defendant\u2019s statement that he was \u201ctired right now\u201d in response to County Court\u2019s inquiry as to whether he was sick and tired of going back to prison \u201cdid not engender \u2018significant doubt\u2019 on the voluntariness of his plea\u201d (People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726 [1995]) and, indeed, the record otherwise reveals that he entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Tate, 28 AD3d 801, 802 [2006]; People v Sanzo, 28 AD3d 802 [2006]). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal precludes his challenges to County Court\u2019s suppression ruling, the severity of his sentence and, inasmuch as his argument does not bear upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the suppression hearing (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006], supra; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 769-770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Schwickrath, supra, at 708).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Spain and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree after he pleaded guilty. The defendant's challenges to the plea's voluntariness and the waiver of his right to appeal were deemed unpreserved for review since he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment. The court found no significant doubt about the plea's voluntariness, and the defendant's waiver of appeal precluded his challenges regarding the suppression ruling and the sentence's severity.</s>"}

The sentence imposed was not only authorized by law, but within the range that County Court promised at the time defendant entered his guilty plea (see, People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903). Defendant was informed by the court that, upon pleading guilty to a class B felony, he could receive a prison sentence with a maximum term of 25 years. Furthermore, another charge was dropped as a result of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances and given defendant\u2019s criminal background, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Gray, 131 AD2d 590).\nCasey, J.

{"text": "<s> [INST] You are a helpful law assistant! Please help me summarize the legal cases.\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the\" County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered October 30, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.\nIn satisfaction of an indictment charging defendant with several crimes related to his role in a conspiracy to traffic and sell cocaine, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 3 to 9 years on the conspiracy count, a prison term of 8V2 years and postrelease supervision of five years on the controlled substance count, and a jail term of one year on the weapon possession count, all to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nWe do not agree with the People that defendant executed a valid appeal waiver. The purported appeal waiver was not cited \u00e1s a term of the plea agreement as initially presented. While defendant stated during the plea colloquy that he understood such a waiver was included, he never indicated that he understood the meaning of the waiver itself, County Court made minimal efforts to explain the nature of it, and defendant did not indicate that he had discussed the issue with counsel. Accordingly, we cannot say that the appeal waiver was a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one (see People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1259-1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]).\nAs defendant\u2019s appeal waiver is invalid, his argument that the sentence is harsh and excessive is properly before us; nevertheless, we reject it. The sentence imposed was within the range agreed to as part of the plea bargain, and we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction thereof given that defendant possessed substantial quantities of cocaine and was intimately involved in its preparation and distribution (see People v Richardson, 28 AD3d 1002, 1005 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 817 [2006]; People v Dolison, 23 AD3d 844, 845 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]).\nPeters, J.P., Rose, Malone Jr., Stein and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. [/INST] The defendant appealed his conviction on charges of conspiracy, criminal possession of a controlled substance, and criminal possession of a weapon, arguing that his appeal waiver was invalid. The court agreed that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary, allowing the appeal on the grounds of sentencing; however, it ultimately affirmed the original sentence, finding it appropriate given the circumstances of the case, including the defendant's substantial involvement in drug trafficking.</s>"}
