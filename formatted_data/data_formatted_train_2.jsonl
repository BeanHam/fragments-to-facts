The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.<|eot_id|>"}

Is it you, or your daughter? \nGuest_family: Good afternoon, doctor. It's my daughter today. \nDoctor: Remind me, how old is she? \nPatient: I'm thirteen, sir. \nDoctor: So, what happened? My nurses tell me she fell today.\nPatient: Yeah, I fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon at about one thirty.\nDoctor: Where does it hurt, young lady?\nPatient: It's really bad here on my left elbow. \nDoctor: Which hand do you write with?\nPatient: I use my right hand for everything, thank goodness for that. \nDoctor: Before seeing me, have you seen anyone else?\nGuest_family: Yeah, we went to an Urgent Care and she had an x ray there. \nDoctor: What else did they do?\nGuest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction.\nDoctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now?\nGuest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. \nDoctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\nPatient: Yes, I do. \nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \nPatient: Yes, it is. \nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \nGuest_family: What should we do?\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.\nGuest_family: O R I F? What's that\nDoctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. \nGuest_family: Will this not heal on its own? \nDoctor: No, we need to do the surgery. \nGuest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: How is this possible?\nDoctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: Will she be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future?\nDoctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose.\nGuest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \nDoctor: When was this? \nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \nDoctor: How did she treat you? \nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\nPatient: Some radiation. \nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck. I have been seeing her since two thousand and two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.<|eot_id|>"}

Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. \nDoctor: When was that?\nPatient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. \nDoctor: Is that when you had the last injections? \nPatient: Correct. \nDoctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?\nPatient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. \nDoctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?\nPatient: Yes, it still hurts. \nDoctor: What makes the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. \nDoctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?\nPatient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. \nDoctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? \nPatient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet.

She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.

It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does.

I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes.

There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.

Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

Before we begin, how old are you?\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor, I'm forty five years young. \nDoctor: Great, and with what race do you identify?\nPatient: I'm an African American. \nDoctor: Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?\nPatient: It started a while ago. I've had this pain in my left shoulder and neck for the last year and a half.\nDoctor: I see, have these symptoms been persistent for the last year and a half? Or do they come and go?\nPatient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.\nDoctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?\nPatient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. \nDoctor: Have these symptoms progressed? \nPatient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. \nDoctor: How did your P C P handle this?\nPatient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. \nDoctor: Do you remember the results of that study?\nPatient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.\nDoctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? \nPatient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. \nDoctor: Did you have any other imagine done? \nPatient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. \nDoctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? \nPatient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. \nDoctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?\nPatient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse. \nDoctor: Okay, going back to the workouts you were doing, are you sure you can't remember anything that would have set this pain off? \nPatient: No, nothing there. \nDoctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?\nPatient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. \nDoctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?\nPatient: No, honestly every position makes it hurt.\nDoctor: Okay, and we've already done two M R I s of the neck, and I've talked about those with you, correct?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?\nPatient: Yes, I saw another surgeon who wanted to do, um, a decompression procedure. \nDoctor: Do you want to go forward with the surgery?\nPatient: No, not really. I'm pretty reluctant to do any kind of surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

What seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}

Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|eot_id|>"}

He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.

Have you applied anything to the area?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is an 11-year-old female who comes in for two different things.  1.  She was seen by the allergist.  No allergies present, so she stopped her Allegra, but she is still real congested and does a lot of snorting.  They do not notice a lot of snoring at night though, but she seems to be always like that.  2.  On her right great toe, she has got some redness and erythema.  Her skin is kind of peeling a little bit, but it has been like that for about a week and a half now.<|eot_id|>"}

He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking.  He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain.  He has had difficulties on and off ever since then.  On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head.  He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.  He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip.<|eot_id|>"}

Thank you. \nDoctor: So, you just celebrated your birthday. How was it? How is it feeling to be close to forties? \nPatient: I just turned thirty nine. I would say older the wiser. \nDoctor: That's true. Okay, so you are here for your follow up. Let's see, you have type one diabetes mellitus, right?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Last time I was here almost four months ago. \nDoctor: How are you doing since last visit? \nPatient: I have been good. My sugar has been under the range. Unfortunately, my pump was having some issues for the last two weeks. \nDoctor: Oh no. What happened? \nPatient: I don't know. I tried to get it fixed but nothing worked out, so I had to buy a new one and then being old kind of hit me. You know, I was not able to set it up. I was stuck on the pump settings and was having a lot of difficulties. With all this going on, I was not able to control my sugar over past two weeks and there might have been like some ups and downs in my levels which I could not notice or register. \nDoctor: During this, did you notice anything like, did you lose your consciousness? Did you faint? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about sweating, tired, or lightheadedness and or change in vision? Or any kind of confusion in mind? \nPatient: Nope, nothing like that. \nDoctor: That's good, so there hasn't been any hypoglycemic event. I mean, your sugar didn't drop down. \nPatient: Oh yeah, I didn't think so. \nDoctor: Okay, let's see how about hyperglycemia? Did you think your sugar levels went high? \nPatient: I think, there was some difficulties with both the fasting and after meals, but I'm not sure. \nDoctor: Are you urinating more than normal? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Are you eating more than normal or drinking more than normal? Are you feeling thirsty or not? \nPatient: Not that I noticed. \nDoctor: Are you exercising? \nPatient: Oh, I tried but didn't work out so not exercising at this point, but I follow a fixed diet. But you know, being a mother is in itself full of physical activities. I mean, I have twins and also a young baby who keep me busy. \nDoctor: Are you working? \nPatient: Yes, I'm working as a medical coder. It is a full time job and you just keep busy. Sometimes I don't even realize that I missed my meal, but I do keep some snacks with me I'm just eating while completing my work. It might not be the best case scenario, but I don't get any time for any kind of physical activities. \nDoctor: Are you visiting your physician regularly? \nPatient: Of course. I'm very regular. I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done. All was good. \nPatient: This reminded me that we did a lab last time I came. How did it go? \nDoctor: Oh yes, thank you for reminding me. Let's see how your numbers are. Your cholesterol is still high. Your L D L recorded one hundred and forty four.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 39-year-old woman returns for followup management of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. \nDoctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it.

I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

I see he has previously had an operation on the right knee, can you tell me more about that? \nGuest_family: He previously had a lot of trouble straightening out both of his legs, and since the right was worse than the left he had an operation on the inside part of the back of that leg. \nDoctor: When was this operation? \nGuest_family: It was in February of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did he respond to the operation? \nGuest_family: He responded really well, he was walking much better, and even got back to playing sports with the other kids in the neighborhood. \nDoctor: What seems to be the problem today? \nGuest_family: Now, his left knee is getting really bad, it's like how the right knee was. He can't straighten this leg. I think we should do the same operation again on the left knee. \nDoctor: Yes, I think we'll have to do surgery. \nGuest_family: What is the risk of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's been less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics in order to minimize infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be under anesthesia for the procedure?\nDoctor: Yes, he will be. He won't feel anything. \nGuest_family: Will this completely solve his problem?\nDoctor: I can't guarantee that he won't need additional procedures in the future.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: How is your pain today? \nPatient: Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it? \nPatient: I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable. \nDoctor: Is the pain localized to one area? \nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body? \nPatient: Nope.  \nDoctor: Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all? \nPatient: Not yet. \nDoctor: Any back pain?  \nPatient: Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs. \nDoctor: Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain? \nPatient: No, no pins and needles. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing stiffness in your back? \nPatient: The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.  \nDoctor: Has it impacted your sleep at all? \nPatient: Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now. \nDoctor: This accident sure did a number on you. \nPatient: No kidding. \nDoctor: You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? \nPatient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. \nDoctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, correct. \nDoctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? \nPatient: A little bit, but not much. \nDoctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? \nPatient: It's stayed more or less the same. \nDoctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? \nPatient: Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.<|eot_id|>"}

That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? \nGuest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint.\nDoctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. \nGuest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent. \nGuest_family_1: Oh, wow, that's low, how is that possible? \nDoctor: We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean. Other Risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness.\nGuest_family_1: Wow, that's great, will be he asleep the entire time? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia, he won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family_1: Will this fix his pain, for sure?\nDoctor: I can't guarantee it, he may still be in some pain. \nGuest_family_1: Okay, what about you, dear? What do you think?\nGuest_family_2: Yeah, I think we should do it, boys should be playing sports with their friends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Are they normal? Because I feel normal.\nDoctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.\nPatient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.\nDoctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. \nPatient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.\nPatient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.\nDoctor: Oh wow.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?\nPatient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.\nDoctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.  She had received fluid rehydration.<|eot_id|>"}

He visited us one month ago for headaches, nausea, and vomiting. His exams from that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home.\nDoctor: Was there any improvement after your discharge, sir?\nPatient: No, I had the same symptoms on and off after that. \nDoctor: What problems are you facing now?\nPatient: I am seeing things blurred and having difficulty concentrating. My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. \nDoctor: How would you describe your headaches? \nPatient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. \nDoctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? \nPatient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.\nDoctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? \nPatient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. \nGuest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.\nDoctor: How about your weight? \nPatient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. \nGuest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.\nDoctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month? \nPatient: It has been bad. I don't feel like eating anymore. Looks like I have lost my appetite.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#. His appetite has been especially poor in the past month.<|eot_id|>"}

Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? \nDoctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Sounds about right. \nDoctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? \nPatient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.\nDoctor_2: Thank you for confirming. \nDoctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? \nDoctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. \nDoctor: What does the C T myelogram say? \nDoctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. \nDoctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. \nDoctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? \nDoctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. \nDoctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? \nPatient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. \nDoctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?\nPatient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. \nDoctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. \nDoctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? \nPatient: Yes. When I walk and stand. \nDoctor: Are you able to walk at all? \nPatient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. \nDoctor: When does it feel better? \nPatient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. \nDoctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? \nPatient: I'd say like a nine. \nDoctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? \nPatient: I think it was a five. \nDoctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? \nDoctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.\nDoctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? \nPatient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. \nDoctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct? \nPatient: That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.<|eot_id|>"}

However, looking at the quiz as he filled it out, he reported that much less than half the time was he able to get erections during sexual activity and only about half of the time he was able to maintain his erection after penetration.  However, he only reports that it is slightly difficult to maintain the erection until completion of intercourse.  Patient has no significant past medical history.  He has never had any previous testicular infections.  He denies any history of injuries to the groin and he has never been told that he has a hernia.<|eot_id|>"}

How are you feeling?\nPatient: I have actually been hospitalized for psychiatric problems and now live in a nursing facility. Things have not been too great. I don't like living there.\nDoctor: I understand the frustration. When you live in a nursing facility you lose a lot of your freedom.\nPatient: I want to live back in my apartment, but I know I am too ill to care for myself. \nDoctor: In spite of all of that how are your respiratory issues?\nPatient: I feel pretty stable. I still have shortness of breath when I do activities, but with my condition I feel like that is something I will have to live with.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, that is the nature of the disease. I am happy to see that the pulmonary disease has not changed significantly since your last visit. \nPatient: The only thing that seems to have changed is that I have a small cough and produce some mucus. \nDoctor: Okay. Do you have any fever or chills?\nPatient: No, none of that. \nDoctor: Do you experience any chest pains?

Let me take a look at this rash. I see you have these small folliculitis lesions that are pus filled bumps centered on your hair. \nPatient: Oh, no. Is that bad? \nDoctor: It's treatable.

Have you been trying anything else? \nPatient: I actually started going to Healing Waters to get photofacials. \nDoctor: I see.

I've been trying to lose weight. \nDoctor: Good, so, what seems to be troubling you today?\nPatient: Well, I have a history of degenerative arthritis in my hips, so my other doctors have said.\nDoctor: How have you been treated for this?\nPatient: I had a right hip replacement with Doctor X in two thousand. \nDoctor: Did this help the pain?\nPatient: Yes, on the right, but over the last three years or so the pain on the left hip has been getting worse. \nDoctor: Has it gotten worse faster recently?\nPatient: Yeah, over the last few months it's gotten really bad. \nDoctor: What kind of medications are you taking for this?\nPatient: Honestly, it's gotten so bad, its uncontrollable pain at this point. I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. \nDoctor: Are you able to do any activities?\nPatient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. \nDoctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. \nPatient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?\nDoctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure. I would not worry about any of these things since you have had a replacement before with no issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months. Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the  procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.<|eot_id|>"}

Oh, maybe fifteen years. At least. \nDoctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same? \nPatient: It is worse right now. \nDoctor: When did the pain become worse? \nPatient: I don't know. It has been getting more painful since it started. Little by little. \nDoctor: Where is the pain? \nPatient: It's in my neck. \nDoctor: Can you show me where the pain in the neck is coming from?\nPatient: It is coming from this area right here. \nDoctor: Right at the base of the neck then? \nPatient: Yeah, I guess. \nDoctor: What does the pain feel like? \nPatient: It hurts.\nDoctor: Mean is the pain sharp or dull? \nPatient: It is sharp. \nDoctor: Okey. Do you have any problems with your mobility? \nPatient: Yes. I am a bit unsteady on my feet. I walk like a duck. \nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? \nPatient: It had been a few years. \nDoctor: Has it become worse over that time? \nPatient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. \nDoctor: How recently? \nPatient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.\nDoctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? \nPatient: I said, no feeling. \nDoctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? \nPatient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.\nPatient: Okay. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening? \nPatient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.\nDoctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations? \nPatient: No. I said no feeling. \nDoctor: Can you feel this? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: How about this? \nPatient: Yes, a little.\nDoctor: How has your back been feeling? \nPatient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. \nDoctor: Do you have any other concerns today? \nPatient: I have been dropping things. \nDoctor: What do you mean dropping things? \nPatient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. \nDoctor: How long has this been happening for? \nPatient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. \nDoctor: The same amount of time as your feet? \nPatient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. \nDoctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. \nPatient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  \nDoctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.

I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \nDoctor: Did that do anything?\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \nDoctor: How did this work? \nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.<|eot_id|>"}

Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity.

He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.<|eot_id|>"}

Since then, he has been complaining of issues with his shoulder. He is not able to raise his hand above his head and sometimes at night he complains of numbness in his right hand fingers. That kind of made me worried.\nDoctor: Hm, okay. Mom, did he get hurt anywhere else too, like head, face or chest? \nGuest_family: No, he landed on his shoulder thankfully. Didn't hit his head. He was also wearing a helmet.\nDoctor: Okay, so are you giving him anything for his shoulder, like pain meds or anti inflammatory to ease his stiffness?\nGuest_family: No, nothing. Although I gave him some honey for his sore throat. He has been complaining of a sore throat, he has a long standing history of strep throat and he did have some exposure to strep. \nDoctor: Hm, did he have any fever or rashes? \nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation?\nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Okay, let me check his shoulder, do you have any other concerns?\nGuest_family: Actually yes, Jay suffers from A D H D, he-\nDoctor: He is seeing Doctor B, right? \nGuest_family: Yes, and the doctor has prescribed him Adderall and Zoloft once a day. With medication he is doing well in school, he is socializing. Overall, he is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications well.\nDoctor: Okay, so what is the concern?\nGuest_family: However, I have noticed that whenever he is not taking his medications, he is having anger outbursts which he is not able to control. He does realize that it's a problem but he can't help it, and this worries me. We have talked about getting help and he has agreed for counselling. I was just wondering if there is anything which can help him, any therapy or counselling session that might benefit him?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is here today with his mom for several complaints.  Number one, he has been having issues with his right shoulder.  Approximately 10 days ago he fell, slipping on ice, did not hit his head but fell straight on his shoulder.  He has been having issues ever since.  He is having difficulties raising his arm over his head.  He does have some intermittent numbness in his fingers at night.  He is not taking any anti-inflammatories or pain relievers.  He is also complaining of a sore throat.  He did have some exposure to Strep and he has a long history of strep throat.  Denies any fevers, rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.  He is also being seen for ADHD by Dr. B.  Adderall and Zoloft.  He takes these once a day.  He does notice when he does not take his medication.  He is doing well in school.  He is socializing well.  He is maintaining his weight and tolerating the medications.  However, he is having issues with anger control.  He realizes when he has anger outbursts that it is a problem.  His mom is concerned.  He actually was willing to go to counseling and was wondering if there was anything available for him at this time.<|eot_id|>"}

I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. \nDoctor: Any history of surgery? \nPatient: I have a pacemaker. \nDoctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? \nPatient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms now? \nPatient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. \nDoctor: Is that your main concern? \nPatient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. \nPatient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. \nPatient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. \nDoctor: Has it been for some time? \nPatient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. \nDoctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any neck pain? \nPatient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. \nDoctor: Have you used anything for your pain? \nPatient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little. It does give me sometimes around three hours of relief. Gabapentin did not work at all. \nDoctor: How is your sleep?\nPatient: I cannot sleep properly because of the pain. It has been for many years. I haven't had a proper sleep. \nDoctor: When did you get your pacemaker? \nPatient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. \nDoctor: Do you have any back pain?\nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any change in bathroom routine? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? \nPatient: No, nothing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?\nDoctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent.

An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.

PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502.  She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin.  She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle.  The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8.  She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy.  Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum.  She was seen by ENT urgently.  She was found to have nasal septum intact.  She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.<|eot_id|>"}

It was an, um, arthroscopy. \nDoctor: When were these surgeries?\nPatient: They were in the nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two time frame, somewhere in there.\nDoctor: How have you managed this since the surgeries?\nPatient: I've taken antiinflammatories, had injections, and I've even used narcotics. \nDoctor: I see. If those haven't helped, I think you'd be a good candidate for knee replacements. \nPatient: Can we do both at the same time?\nDoctor: No, let's do the left since that one hurts more. Do you have any other conditions I should know about?\nPatient: I've had a lot of back surgeries, I have spinal stenosis. \nDoctor: Do you know what surgeries you've had?\nPatient: Let me check my notes, um, I've had a spinal decompression and epidural steroids injection. \nDoctor: Who has prescribed you narcotics for this pain?\nPatient: The pain is so bad, but Doctor X has handled those.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 57-year-old with severe bilateral knee DJD, left greater than right, with significant pain and limitations because of both. He is able to walk approximately a 1/2-mile a day but is limited because of his knees.  Stairs are negotiated 1 at a time.  His problems with bilateral knee DJD have been well documented.  He had arthroscopy in the 1991/199two time frame for both of these.  He has been on long-standing conservative course for these including nonsteroidals, narcotics, injections.  At this point because of his progressive and persistent limitations he has opted for total joint surgery on the left side.  He does have other arthritic complaints including multiple back surgeries for spinal stenosis including decompression and epidural steroids.  Significant pain is handled by narcotic medication.

I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.<|eot_id|>"}

On August seventh. \nPatient: That sounds right. \nDoctor: Your surgeries may have been the reason for the C diff. \nPatient: What is C diff?\nDoctor: It is an infection in the large intestine. It is often caused by overuse of antibiotics, and you have been on them for a while due to the surgeries that you have had.

Let's get started, how old are you?\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor. I'm fifty two years old. \nDoctor: My nurse says that you're here for an independent evaluation, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir, that is. \nDoctor: Good, what do you do for a living? \nPatient: Right now, I'm a temporary employee for A B C A B C, I've worked for A B C D, too. \nDoctor: What do you do there?\nPatient: Mainly, I handle the loading and unloading of furniture and appliances for people's houses. \nDoctor: That's hard work. When did you get hurt? \nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \nDoctor: What did they do for you?\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \nDoctor: Did this help at all?\nPatient: No, not at all. \nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \nDoctor: When did you see them? \nPatient: That was back in April. \nDoctor: What did they recommend? \nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\nPatient: It's really on my right. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\nPatient: Really, no, it did not. I still have the pain down my legs today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.<|eot_id|>"}

Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he \"felt it\" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you please represent the patients case? \nGuest_clinician: This is Miss A B C. She's here for her follow up regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. She was seen by you on nineteenth June. She had an incident on fourth of June, when she lifted many objects and experienced exacerbated symptoms. She is experiencing paresthesia, weakness, and pain in her upper extremities on the right side more than the left since then. She was referred for a cervical spine M R I. \nDoctor: So, how are you feeling today? \nPatient: I'm still having all those things like pain and weakness, and I believe that everything is coming down from my neck.\nDoctor: Did you get some physical therapy? Did it help? \nPatient: I did some. It was helping me with my neck pain. But this right hand is still feeling weak. I feel it is difficult at times to open jars and open doors. Many times, I drop items. \nDoctor: Is it happening with both hands or one is more than the other? \nPatient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. \nDoctor: Anything else that you noticed? \nPatient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that. \nDoctor: Are you seeing anyone for that? \nPatient: Yeah, Doctor X is trying to help me, uh, with that without surgery. His methods are good it and it is helping me with my neck pain, but not hand. \nDoctor: Are you having any issues with your bowel movements? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any pain in the lower side of your back or in your legs? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any problem with walking or stability? \nPatient: Nope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects. I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom.

This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.

Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.

Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. \nDoctor: What eyelid was drooping? \nPatient: I don't remember? \nDoctor: What is your dominate hand? \nPatient: I am right handed. \nDoctor: And how old are you? \nPatient: I am sixty seven. \nDoctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?\nPatient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.<|eot_id|>"}

She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.
