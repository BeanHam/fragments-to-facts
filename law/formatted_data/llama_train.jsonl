Defendant was thereafter sentenced, pursuant to the plea agreement, to a term of imprisonment of two years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal is unpersuasive. Our review of the plea colloquy and the written waiver executed by defendant reveals that he was apprised of and clearly understood the rights that he was forfeiting, including the right to appeal his sentence (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013]; People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1108 [2012]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Defendant\u2019s sole remaining contention on appeal, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Marshall, 108 AD3d 884, 884 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 957 [2013]; People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).\nLahtinen, J.E, Stein and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree after he pleaded guilty.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered January 6, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nWaiving his right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to two years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals contending that his plea was involuntarily procured and that his sentence was harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of the plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Vanguilder, 32 AD3d 1110, 1110 [2006]; People v Missimer, 32 AD3d 1114, 1114-1115 [2006]). Nevertheless, a review of the plea minutes reveals that defendant\u2019s plea was entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily (see People v Jones, 30 AD3d 633, 633 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]). Moreover, while defendant\u2019s valid waiver of appeal precludes his contention that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Alexander, 31 AD3d 885, 886 [2006]), there is no basis in this record for reducing the sentence.\nCardona, EJ., Mercure, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

When it accepted the plea and released defendant from custody pending sentencing, the court informed defendant that it would impose a term of incarceration of I2V2 to 25 years if defendant did not return, and it does not appear that the court gave due consideration to the appropriate sentencing factors when it fulfilled that commitment (see, People v Nicholson, 237 AD2d 973, lv denied 90 NY2d 908). The additional prison time based upon defendant\u2019s failure to appear exceeds the sentence for bail jumping in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 215.57). In our view, the sentence of 12V2 to 25 years imposed upon the conviction of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree is unduly harsh. We exercise our discretion in the interest of justice to reduce the sentence on those counts to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 7 to 14 years. We have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit.

Consequently, the sentence was reduced to concurrent terms of 7 to 14 years for the drug possession counts.<|eot_id|>"}

The unidentified caller stated that the man was black and was wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and white sneakers. Police proceeded to the area and observed defendant, who largely fit that description, getting into a taxi. The taxi was followed and, several minutes later, was pulled over by a marked patrol car. Defendant bolted from the taxi and was pursued by police, who eventually apprehended him and found him to be in possession of a stun gun and a magazine of ammunition for a .45 caliber handgun. A further search of the area disclosed a .45 caliber handgun approximately 15 to 20 yards from where defendant had been taken into custody.\nSubsequently, defendant was indicted on various weapons charges as a result of the incident, and sought to suppress the physical evidence recovered. County Court conducted a suppression hearing and denied that application. Thereafter, pursuant to an agreement resolving the weapons charges as well as an unrelated indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. In March 2011, County Court sentenced defendant, as agreed, to an aggregate prison term of six years to be followed by post-release supervision of five years. After learning that defendant should have been sentenced as a second felony offender, County Court summoned defendant before it for resentencing in September 2012. County Court then denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, found him to be a second felony offender, and resentenced him to a sentence identical to that originally imposed.\nDefendant now appeals from the resentencing, solely arguing that County Court\u2019s suppression ruling was erroneous. Inasmuch as \u201cdefendant never filed a timely notice of appeal from the original judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the propriety of the suppression ruling on his appeal from the resentence[ ]\u201d (People v Anderson, 151 AD2d 684, 685 [1989]; see CPL 450.30 [3]; People v Jordan, 16 NY3d 845, 846 [2011]; People v Henriquez, 112 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1021 [2014]). Defendant\u2019s remedy, if any, lies in filing an application for a writ of error coram nobis (see People v Syville, 15 NY3d 391, 399-401 [2010]; People v Henriquez, 112 AD3d at 1061 n 3).\nMcCarthy, J.E, Garry and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the resentencing of the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance and attempted criminal possession of a weapon. The defendant's appeal challenged the suppression of evidence, but the court ruled that he could not contest this issue on appeal since he did not file a timely notice of appeal from the original conviction. The court noted that the appropriate remedy for the defendant would be to seek a writ of error coram nobis.<|eot_id|>"}

We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was based upon an unrelated assault charge. Defendant\u2019s contention arises from the fact that the People rejected defendant\u2019s request that he be placed in extensive rehabilitation instead of serving a prison term based in part upon defendant\u2019s admission that he had been convicted of prior felonies and had recently been released on parole at the time of the instant offense. Furthermore, inasmuch as defendant was sentenced in accordance with the favorable plea agreement to the most lenient sentence permitted by statute (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] [b]), we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed (see People v Sczepankowski, 293 AD2d 212, 215-216 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 564 [2002]).\nPeters, J.P, Mugglin, Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

The terms of the plea agreement further provided that if defendant successfully completed a six-month period of interim probation, she would be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea and enter a plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and be sentenced to five years of probation. However, if defendant failed to successfully complete the period of interim probation, she was advised that she would be subject to a prison sentence of up to 5V2 years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant also waived her right to appeal as a part of the plea agreement. After defendant was found to be in violation of the terms of the plea agreement based upon her admitted failure to comply with the terms of her interim probation, County Court imposed a prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nContrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that she made a valid waiver of the right to appeal. County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited upon defendant\u2019s guilty plea and defendant signed a written appeal waiver in open court acknowledging that counsel discussed the waiver with her and that she was waiving the right knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently (see People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011]; People v Wicks, 83 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]). To the extent that defendant argues that her guilty plea was involuntary, the record contains no indication that defendant preserved this argument by a motion to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and there is nothing in the record that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Secore, 102 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2013]; People v Wicks, 83 AD3d at 1224). Finally, in light of defendant\u2019s valid waiver of the right to appeal, her complaints regarding counsel\u2019s representation are precluded, except to the extent that they implicate the voluntariness of her plea and, to that extent, they are unpreserved and meritless (see People v Walker, 84 AD3d 1643, 1643-1644 [2011]; People v Belle, 74 AD3d 1477, 1480 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 918 [2010]). Her assertion that the sentence was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by her valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]).\nRose, J.E, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the County Court of Warren County upheld the defendant's conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, following a guilty plea under a negotiated agreement.

As so modified, the judgments are affirmed.\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, there was no requirement that the Trial Judge be disqualified from presiding over the trial (see, People v Tartaglia, 35 NY2d 918, 919; People ex rel. Stickle v Fay, 14 NY2d 683; People v Harris, 117 AD2d 881, 882), notwithstanding our earlier decision which reversed the conviction of the defendant\u2019s accomplice (People v Smith, 120 AD2d 753). This is especially so since the defendant and Smith were tried separately, before juries (cf. People v Corelli, 41 AD2d 939; People v Vetrano, 42 AD2d 987), and while the Trial Judge, before assuming his judicial office, had, as an Assistant District Attorney, prosecuted Smith, he did not prosecute this defendant.\nWe do find, however, that the defendant\u2019s sentences were excessive to the extent indicated, as it appears that he was impermissibly penalized for asserting his right to a trial (see, People v Patterson, 106 AD2d 520). Mangano, J. P., Niehoff, Lawrence and Kunzeman, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed his convictions for multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, which resulted in sentences of 8 \u00bd to 25 years of imprisonment.

The court also ruled that there was no requirement for the trial judge's disqualification, and it found the sentences excessive, indicating that the defendant had been penalized for exercising his right to a trial.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of seven years to life. Following an unsuccessful appeal (28 AD3d 872 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 758 [2006]) and various postconviction motions, County Court granted defendant\u2019s application for resentencing pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (L 2005, ch 643, \u00a7 1), and scheduled a resentencing hearing. At the conclusion thereof, County Court resentenced defendant to determinate prison terms of five years on each count, to run consecutively, with five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we now modify, by vacating the sentence imposed.\nOur analysis starts by recognizing that County Court failed to follow the proper procedures when resentencing defendant pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005. Although defendant failed to preserve this argument for appellate review, we conclude that modification in the interest of justice is warranted (see CPL 470.15 [1]). Once it is determined that a defendant is eligible to be resentenced pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005, the sentencing court must \u201cspecify and inform such person of the term of a determinate sentence of imprisonment it would impose upon such conviction . . . and shall enter an order to that effect\u201d (L 2005, ch 643, \u00a7 1; see People v Love, 46 AD3d 919, 920-921 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 842 [2008]). The court must then notify the defendant that unless he or she either withdraws the application to be resentenced or appeals from the order, the court will vacate the previous sentence and impose the determinate sentence (see L 2005, ch 643, \u00a7 1; People v Love, 46 AD3d at 921).\nHere, County Court proceeded to resentence defendant without issuing an order specifying the determinate sentence that would be imposed upon resentencing and without ensuring that defendant was aware of his right to withdraw his resentencing application or appeal the resentence order (cf. People v Bennett, 31 AD3d 298, 299 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 846 [2006]). Inasmuch as the new sentence is not \u201ca much more favorable sentence than the one originally imposed\u201d (People v Paniagua, 45 AD3d 98, 102 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 992 [2007]), we vacate the resentence and remit to give defendant an opportunity to make an informed decision regarding whether to withdraw his resentence application or appeal the resentence order (see People v Love, 46 AD3d at 921).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments are rendered academic by our decision.\nSpain, Lahtinen, Kane and Malone Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court modified the County Court's resentencing of the defendant for two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, vacating the new sentence due to procedural errors.

The case was remitted to the County Court for further proceedings, allowing the defendant to make an informed decision about his options.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant was promised a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison on the drug sale charge and a concurrent definite one-year term on the weapon charge. Claiming that she was innocent of the drug sale and was suffering from postpartum depression when she entered her guilty plea, defendant moved to withdraw the plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea survived her waiver of the right to appeal and was preserved by her motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806). A review of the plea allocution discloses that defendant, who was represented by counsel, was fully informed of the rights she was waiving, understood the nature and consequences of her plea, was acting of her own free will without any coercion, had no mental health problems, and admitted that she committed the drug sale and weapon possession crimes at the time and place alleged in the superior court information. Accordingly, the allocution was sufficient to demonstrate that her plea was the result of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent choice (see, e.g., People v Bolden, 289 AD2d 607; People v Dashnaw, 260 AD2d 658, lv denied 93 NY2d 968). Whether to permit defendant to withdraw the guilty plea was a matter within County Court\u2019s sound discretion and, absent an abuse of that discretion, the court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed (see, People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746). In view of the absence of any evidence in the record to substantiate defendant\u2019s subsequent claims of innocence and postpartum depression, claims which are inconsistent with her sworn statements at the time of the plea, we see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of the motion (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; People v Hunter, 246 AD2d 913).\nIn light of our resolution of defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea, her final claim regarding the severity of the sentence is encompassed by her waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v McCann, 289 AD2d 703). In any event, we find neither an abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed nor any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification.\nMercure, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Subsequently, defendant was charged in an indictment with multiple counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance after cocaine was found in his pocket when police executed a no-knock warrant on the apartment of an acquaintance. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the second indictment. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the bargained for prison term of four years and three years of postrelease supervision on the first charge and 21h years and two years of postrelease supervision on the second charge, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution regarding the offense charged in the second indictment is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d 853, 854 [2009]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1133 [2008]). We also find that the narrow exception to the preservation rule does not apply because defendant made no statements during the allocution that served to cast doubt upon his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d at 854; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d at 1133; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]). In any event, contrary, to defendant\u2019s contention, it was not necessary that he recite every element of the crime or engage in a factual recitation, inasmuch as his affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s questions established the elements of the crime charged (see People v Kaszubinski, 55 AD3d 1133, 1136 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 855 [2009]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d at 1133-1134; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d at 967).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that County Court erred because it did not advise him at the time of his guilty plea that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender is similarly unpreserved by defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mayers, 74 NY2d 931, 931-932 [1989]; People v Kopy, 54 AD3d 441, 441 [2008]; People v Granan, 48 AD3d 975, 975-976 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 959 [2008]).\nMercure, J.E, Kane, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur.

The defendant's appeal was rejected as he failed to preserve his claims regarding the sufficiency of his plea and the court's advisement on his status as a second felony offender, as he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the conviction. The court found that his plea allocution adequately established the elements of the crimes charged.<|eot_id|>"}

In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must overcome the presumption of effectiveness and show that counsel failed to provide meaningful representation (People v Jackson, 70 NY2d 768, 769). The defendant\u2019s claim that shock incarceration was part of the plea agreement rests upon matters which are dehors the record and may only be raised upon a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (see, People v Lebrun, 234 AD2d 392). Additionally, the defendant does not allege that he is actually innocent of the charges to which he voluntarily pleaded guilty (see, People v Hayes, 186 AD2d 268, 269).\nAs the People correctly concede, the court imposed an illegal sentence of SVe to 9V3 years imprisonment under Indictment No. 96-00210. The court should have imposed a minimum term of imprisonment of one-third of the maximum term (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [b]). However, we otherwise decline to modify the sentence as we do not find it to be excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Rosenblatt, J.

The plea was entered with the express understanding that defendant would receive a prison term of six years to life if sentenced as a second felony offender or three years to life if not sentenced as a second felony offender, and accepted only upon the condition that defendant waive her right to appeal. Having entered the plea and waived her right to appeal, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to six years to life. Defendant now appeals contending that County Court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle in which she was a passenger and in adjudicating her as a second felony offender. We affirm.\nIn our view, defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived her right to appeal (see, People v Collier, 226 AD2d 923, lv denied 88 NY2d 935; People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958, lv denied 87 NY2d 1025; see also, People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, 830, cert denied 423 US 873). County Court\u2019s statement on the record that defendant was waiving all her appellate rights except those constitutional issues that survive such a waiver under the principles enunciated in People v Seaberg (74 NY2d 1) neither preserved defendant\u2019s right to appeal the denial of her suppression motion (see, CPL 710.70 [2]; see also, People v Dixon, 210 AD2d 532) nor gave her any reason to believe that she was not in fact waiving such right (see, People v Williams, supra, at 830; People v Scott, supra). Under these circumstances, the waiver of defendant\u2019s right to appeal the denial of her suppression motion will be enforced.\nAs a final matter, in the absence of any substantiation that defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction was unconstitutionally obtained (see, CPL 400.21 [7] [a], [b]), her sentence as a second felony offender was appropriate (see, People v Robare, 226 AD2d 832; People v Stevens, 218 AD2d 678, lv denied 87 NY2d 908).\nMikoll, J.

In full satisfaction of these charges, he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. As part of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to the agreed-upon prison term of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, together with an order directing his enrollment in a shock incarceration program.\nDefendant appeals.\nFirst, defendant contends that the evidence against him should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. However, such contention does not survive a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Santalucia, 19 AD3d 806, 807 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 856 [2005]; People v Hodge, 4 AD3d 676, 677 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 800 [2004]). Defendant does not claim that his waiver was invalid, and the record reveals that County Court explained the nature and consequences of the waiver in detail, distinguished this aspect of defendant\u2019s plea agreement from the other rights forfeited by his guilty plea, and ascertained that defendant understood these explanations (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1131-1132 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]). Accordingly, the waiver of the right to appeal was valid, and defendant\u2019s challenge to the legality of his arrest is foreclosed (see People v Hodge, 4 AD3d at 677).\nDefendant also contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s failure to request a suppression hearing. To the extent that this claim implicates the voluntariness of his plea and thus survives his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Wicks, 83 AD3d 1223, 1225 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]), it is nevertheless unpreserved for appellate review, as the record does not reveal that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014]; People v White, 122 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2014]; People v Moses, 110 AD3d 1118, 1118-1119 [2013]). In any event, the failure to request a sup pression hearing, standing alone, does not establish that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2010]; People v Jackson, 67 AD3d 1067, 1068 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 801 [2010]). Here, nothing else in the record casts doubt on the effectiveness of defense counsel, who, among other things, secured an advantageous plea bargain for defendant. Defendant affirmed during the plea colloquy that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation, and if the issue had been preserved, we would have concluded that he received meaningful representation (see People v Aitken, 101 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1040 [2013]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]; People v Gentry, 73 AD3d at 1384).\nPeters, P.J., McCarthy and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court upheld the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty, waiving his right to appeal. His claims regarding the suppression of evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel were found to be invalid, as he did not contest the validity of his waiver and failed to preserve the ineffective assistance claim for review. The court affirmed the sentence of two years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision.<|eot_id|>"}

Following an investigation which revealed that fraudulent claims had been filed by the corporation for Medicaid reimbursement, defendants pleaded guilty to the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree as charged in a superior court information. On November 21, 1997, County Court sentenced defendants to 1 to 3 years in prison. In addition, defendants were ordered, along with other codefendants, to pay restitution in the amount of $76,608. On appeal, defendants argue that the sentences imposed by County Court are harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. We acknowledge that there are considerations which support more lenient sentences herein, such as the valuable services provided by defendants to the community as evidenced by the numerous letters written on their behalf, defendants\u2019 expressions of remorse for their actions and the recommendations contained in the presentence reports. Nevertheless, inasmuch as County Court considered appropriate factors in imposing sentence, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion nor do we find that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a reduction (see generally, People v Hearn, 248 AD2d 889; see, People v Torres, 237 AD2d 650, 652; People v Scotti, 232 AD2d 775, 777, lv denied 89 NY2d 946).

He also waived the right to appeal. Sentenced to the agreed-upon parole supervision in an intensive drug treatment program, defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in accepting his plea.\nAccording to defendant, the People had no laboratory report to establish that the substance he sold was a controlled substance and he was unaware of that deficiency in the People\u2019s proof when he entered his plea. To the extent that defendant\u2019s argument constitutes a challenge to the knowing, intelligent and voluntary nature of his plea, that challenge has not been preserved for our review as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment (see, People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 832). County Court conducted an appropriate plea allocution and the record establishes that this is not one of those rare cases where the court had a duty to inquire further to ensure that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666). To the extent that defendant\u2019s argument constitutes a challenge relating to one of the factual elements of the crime charged, that challenge was forfeited by the guilty plea, which removed the issue of factual guilt from the case (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5). There is only a \u201climited group of questions which survive a plea\u201d (People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993) and defendant\u2019s argument does not involve the type of fundamental matter that is preserved despite the guilty plea (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 5). Finally, defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal precludes review of his claim regarding the severity of the sentence (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733), a claim which we would find without merit in any event.\nCrew III, J.

Defendant now appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and, further, that County Court erred in summarily denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved of her assignment.\n\u201cIn the absence of an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances, the sentence imposed by the sentencing court will not be disturbed\u201d (People v Flint, 66 AD3d 1245, 1246 [2009] [citations omitted]). Given defendant\u2019s criminal history, we discern no reason to disturb the sentence imposed. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the fact that the instant offense represents his first felony conviction does not establish extraordinary circumstances (see People v Bonelli, 41 AD3d 972, 974 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 921 [2007]). Similarly, the fact that other individuals who committed the same crime may have received lesser sentences is of no moment, as \u201cno two defendants are quite alike even if they have committed, in legal definition, identical offenses\u201d (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 234 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]).\nTurning to the assigned counsel issue, \u201c[t]he right of an indigent criminal defendant to the services of a court-appointed lawyer does not encompass a right to appointment of successive lawyers at defendant\u2019s option\u201d (People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]). Rather, a defendant seeking new assigned counsel must demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution (see id,.; People v Davenport, 58 AD3d 892, 895 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 782 [2009]). No such showing was made here.\nWhen defendant requested a change of counsel in July 2008, County Court questioned defendant extensively as to the basis for his application, summarized counsel\u2019s efforts on defendant\u2019s behalf and ultimately concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution. Two months later, when the Assistant Public Defender representing defendant sought to be relieved of the assignment, County Court again denied the request for new counsel. Based upon our review of the record as a whole, we cannot say that County Court failed to carefully evaluate this request. While the record reflects some dissatisfaction with counsel (see People v Davenport, 58 AD3d at 895), County Court had the opportunity to observe the \u201congoing dialogue\u201d between defendant and counsel during the course of this action and concluded that the relationship between the two was \u201cconducive to providing meaningful representation during the course of the trial.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Malone Jr. and Kavanagh, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant's appeal from a conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree was denied, as the court found no abuse of discretion in the six-year prison sentence imposed, despite the defendant's claims of harshness and excessive nature.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered October 29, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn satisfaction of a multiple-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, executed a written waiver of the right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison term of 4I/s to 82/s years. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and, therefore, his challenge to his sentence is preserved. Assuming arguendo, that the colloquy between defendant and County Court was insufficient to establish a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, we, nevertheless, find that the sentence was neither harsh nor excessive. In that regard, we note that defendant was accorded a significant measure of leniency when County Court accepted his plea to a single reduced charge in satisfaction of a number of serious charges pending against him. In addition to being a second felony offender, defendant was on probation when he committed the instant crime, had prior misdemeanor drug convictions, and failed to complete drug treatment programs provided for him. Given these circumstances and the fact that the sentence was within statutory guidelines, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances which would warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Clark, 263 AD2d 551, lv denied 93 NY2d 1016).\nMercure, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

County Court thereafter imposed concurrent sentences of two years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision for the criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction and lVs to 4 years in prison for the grand larceny conviction. County Court also ordered defendant to pay restitution to the victim of the grand larceny. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s valid waiver of appeal precludes us from addressing his argument that his agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Houck, 74 AD3d 1476,1477 [2010]; People v Walley, 63 AD3d 1284, 1286 [2009]). While surviving his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant\u2019s contention that his plea was rendered involuntary by the ineffective assistance of counsel is unpreserved for our review due to defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Davis, 74 AD3d 1490, 1490 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 850 [2010]; People v Volfson, 69 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010]; People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251-1252 [2009]).\nCounty Court erred by setting a restitution amount without conducting a restitution hearing because there was insufficient evidence to determine the victim\u2019s loss. Because the plea agreement required defendant to pay restitution but did not contain the specific amount to be paid, defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from challenging the restitution order (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]). Defendant preserved this challenge when counsel questioned the amount of restitution at sentencing (see People v Horne, 97 NY2d 404, 414 n 3 [2002]; People v Empey, 73 AD3d at 1389; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d at 1232).\nAs to the merits of defendant\u2019s argument, a restitution hearing must be held where the record lacks sufficient evidence for a court to determine the amount of restitution ordered or the defendant requests such a hearing (see Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [2]). A trial court may not rely entirely on the Probation Department\u2019s recommendations when ordering restitution (see People v Fuller, 57 NY2d 152, 158-159 [1982]; People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 145 [1996]; People v Pelkey, 63 AD3d 1188, 1190 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 748 [2009]). Here, County Court did just that by ordering \u201crestitution in the amount of $1,460.96, per the probation report.\u201d The only record support for this amount came from the presentence investigation report, which was based solely on a letter received from the victim of the larceny. No other evidence is contained in the record to support the amount of damages requested by the victim. In fact, the victim claimed that he was entitled to $700 to have the barrel of his gun replaced and new fiber optic sights put on, but the felony complaint alleged that defendant stole a shotgun with a slug barrel and glow sights valued at approximately $600. Not only is it unclear why the barrel needs to be replaced but,, at sentenc ing, defense counsel aptly noted that the value of the replacement barrel was higher than the value of the entire gun. Additionally, the victim sought \u2014 and received \u2014 $760.96 for five lost days of work, but it is unclear who lost days from work, what that person\u2019s daily wage was, and how those days were related to defendant\u2019s offense. For example, the victim\u2019s letter, attached to the presentence investigation report, states that the victim\u2019s wife took at least one day off from work before even discovering that the shotguns were missing. As County Court relied solely on the presentence investigation report, which is itself based on insufficient evidence to uphold the restitution ordered, a hearing is required to determine the appropriate amount of restitution (see People v Travis, 64 AD3d 808, 808-809 [2009]; People v Pelkey, 63 AD3d at 1190-1191; People v Monette, 199 AD2d 589 [1993]).\nPeters, J.P., Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reversing so much thereof as ordered restitution; matter remitted to the County Court of Cortland County for a restitution hearing; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nAlthough defendant agreed, as part of his plea bargain, \u201cto make any reasonable amount of restitution that may be requested by the victim without the necessity of a hearing,\u201d we do not consider defendant to have given up his right to a hearing here because it is unclear whether the amount requested was reasonable (see People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 144-145 [1996]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's guilty plea for criminal sale of a controlled substance and grand larceny but reversed the restitution order due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support the amount. The County Court had relied solely on the Probation Department's report without conducting a hearing to determine the appropriate restitution, which the appellate court deemed necessary. The case was remitted for a restitution hearing to properly assess the victim's losses.<|eot_id|>"}

The defendant was removed from the vehicle and placed in the back of a State Police vehicle. Two State Troopers testified that they observed the defendant, while seated in the back of the State Police vehicle, attempting to conceal or dispose of a package containing white powder. That substance was subsequently determined to be cocaine. During a search of the defendant at a State Police station, a State Trooper recovered a small amount of marijuana from his clothing.\nThe County Court did not err in excusing a certain prospective juror, in effect, for cause on the ground that the juror\u2019s statements indicated that she \u201cha[d] a state of mind that [was] likely to preclude [her] from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial\u201d (CPL 270.20 [1] [b]; see People v Scott, 16 NY3d 589, 595 [2011]; People v Johnson, 94 NY2d 600, 614 [2000]). The challenge for cause to the subject juror was not untimely (see CPL 270.15 [4]; see also People v Harris, 57 NY2d 335, 350 [1982]).\nThe County Court improperly conducted an ex parte conference with the prosecutor as to whether the subject prospective juror should be excused. Nonetheless, the court subsequently disclosed to the defense the substance of that conference. Further, as the subject prospective juror was ultimately properly excused for cause, the action of the court in conducting the ex parte conference did not result in prejudice, and does not warrant reversal under the circumstances (see People v Christie, 241 AD2d 699, 701 [1997]; People v Williams, 162 AD2d 649 [1990]).\nThe County Court erred in finding that the defendant\u2019s Batson application (see Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79 [1986]) was untimely. A Batson challenge is timely where it is made prior to the commencement of trial, as was done here (see People v Scott, 70 NY2d 420, 425 [1987]; People v Ramirez, 295 AD2d 542 [2002]; People v Campos, 290 AD2d 456, 457 [2002]). The defendant properly preserved for appellate review his contention as to the allegedly improper use of peremptory challenges by the People (see People v Ramos, 91 AD3d 674 [2012]; People v Davis, 253 AD2d 634, 635 [1998]). However, the defendant failed to meet his prima facie burden of setting forth facts supporting an inference of discrimination (see People v Hecker, 15 NY3d 625, 653 [2010]; People v Green, 141 AD3d 1036 [2016]; People v Fryar, 29 AD3d 919, 920-921 [2006]).\nThe County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion nor violate the defendant\u2019s right of compulsory process in denying his motion to subpoena a certain witness pursuant to CPL 650.20 or to depose that witness pursuant to CPL 680.10 (see People v Bradford, 300 AD2d 685, 686 [2002]; People v Rosenthal, 207 AD2d 364 [1994]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention, raised in his pro se supplemental brief, that the County Court failed to comply with the procedure for handling jury notes set forth by the Court of Appeals in People v O\u2019Rama (78 NY2d 270, 277-278 [1991]) is without merit. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the court did not fail to meaningfully respond to the jury note in question (cf. People v Kisoon, 8 NY3d 129, 133, 135 [2007]).\nHowever, the sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated herein.\nRivera, J.P., Austin, Hinds-Radix and Maltese, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of marijuana, resulting in a 15-year prison sentence.

The appeal raised issues regarding jury selection, the handling of juror challenges, and whether the court properly responded to jury notes, but ultimately, the court found no reversible errors.<|eot_id|>"}

Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court imposed a one-year term of interim probation supervision and ordered defendant to comply with the terms and conditions thereof, warning him that, if he violated the conditions, he faced up to eight years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. In August 2014, following a hearing, County Court found that defendant had violated the terms of interim probation and resentenced him to an additional year of interim probation. In March 2015, defendant was indicted on various drug charges and ultimately convicted of six felonies in January 2016. As a result, County Court found that defendant had again failed to comply with the conditions of his interim probation and sentenced him, as a second felony drug offender, to a five-year prison term to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that his combined oral and written waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). The plea minutes demonstrate that defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea and that he understood and voluntarily agreed to this condition, and County Court made clear that the waiver of appeal was separate and distinct from the trial-related rights that he automatically forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Belile, 137 AD3d 1460, 1461 [2016]). Defendant then signed a detailed written waiver in open court that outlined his rights and the consequences of the waiver, that specifically waived his right to challenge the severity of the sentence and that indicated that defendant had discussed the waiver with counsel and understood it. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver precludes his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive given that he was informed of the sentence that could be imposed if he did not successfully complete the term of interim probation (see People v Tulip, 150 AD3d 1564, 1565-1566 [2017]; People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]).\nPeters, P.J., McCarthy, Rose, Devine and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of St. Lawrence County convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal.

The appellate court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the defendant's appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, thus barring any challenge to the severity of his sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree on the understanding that she would be sentenced as a second felony drug offender to a prison term of three years and postrelease supervision of two years, to run concurrently to the sentence imposed in a separate proce\u00e9ding. She further waived her right to appeal and, reinforcing her earlier Parker warnings, was told that her failure to appear for sentencing could result in an enhanced sentence of up to eight years of imprisonment to be followed by postrelease supervision.

During the plea proceeding, the People informed County Court that, pursuant to the negotiated agreement, it recommended concurrent sentences of 4V2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision on both counts. At sentencing, the People recommended concurrent sentences of 4V2 years in prison and three years of post-release supervision. Thereafter, County Court proceeded to sentence defendant, as a second felony offender, to two concurrent sentences of 44/2 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant contends that her plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered because she was informed at the time of her plea that she would be sentenced to two years of postrelease supervision. Although the terms of postrelease supervision imposed by County Court differed from the terms stated at the plea proceeding, defendant\u2019s claim that her plea was involuntary on that basis is unpreserved for our review due to her failure to bring it to County Court\u2019s attention, either when she was made aware of the terms at the outset of the sentencing proceeding (see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Lee, 80 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 832 [2011]) or when the sentence was imposed (see People v Davis, 79 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 797 [2011]).\nPeters, J.P., Spain, Lahtinen and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony, in exchange for a promised sentence of 3 to 6 years in prison. The agreement presupposed that defendant qualified as a predicate felon. During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged giving heroin to one Reynolds. On May 8, 1987, the scheduled sentencing date, defendant moved to vacate his guilty plea, indicating that he was now aware of certain defenses. The matter was adjourned pending County Court\u2019s review of the plea minutes. On May 18, 1987 the court, after review of the plea minutes, rejected the withdrawal motion but acceded to defense counsel\u2019s request to submit a memorandum of law. On May 26, 1987 defendant submitted a written motion to vacate, contending that the agreed-upon sentence was unauthorized since the People failed to establish the existence of a prior felony conviction. On June 8, 1987, while again denying the vacatur motion, County Court recognized that the agreed sentence could not be imposed because defendant\u2019s status as a predicate felon had not been confirmed. Upon a conviction of a class D felony, the minimum component of an indeterminate sentence may not exceed one third of the maximum term imposed (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [b]X Consequently, the court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 2 to 6 years in prison.\nOn this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate the plea inasmuch as the bargained-for sentence was unauthorized. At first glance, the argument seems implausible for defendant actually received a lesser sentence than bargained for. However, \"[i]t is fundamental that the breach of a promise made to induce a guilty plea entitles a defendant to either withdraw his plea or be resentenced\u201d (People v Felman, 137 AD2d 341, 343; see, People v Jones, 99 AD2d 1). The question here is whether any promises were in fact breached. It is evident that the plea agreement was premised on defendant\u2019s potential status as a predicate felon. At sentencing, the People acknowledged that they were not able to demonstrate the existence of a prior felony conviction (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15; cf., People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142) and thus the bargained-for sentence, which set the minimum at one half the maximum, was unauthorized (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [bJX\nWe do not, however, agree that a lesser sentence served to breach the plea agreement. The inability to impose a predicate sentence did not undermine the very basis of the plea agreement since the benefits remained intact (cf., People v Traynor, 101 AD2d 898). Defendant was charged with a class B felony with a maximum exposure of 8 Vs to 25 years in prison (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and sought to minimize his prison exposure. This objective was clearly achieved. Moreover, it is difficult to perceive how defendant was misled into believing he qualified as a predicate felon. In our view, the sentence was appropriately reduced to reflect defendant\u2019s correct status, and was in accord with the plea agreement.\nNor did defendant otherwise establish a viable basis for vacating the plea. The plea minutes show that defendant, a college graduate, voluntarily entered the plea and specifically discussed any potential defenses, including agency and entrapment, with counsel (see, People v Pratt, 99 AD2d 909).\nWe further conclude that defendant was accorded a reason able opportunity to advance his challenge to the plea at the various appearance dates. There is no precise formula for entertaining a motion to withdraw, provided the applicant is accorded a reasonable opportunity to advance his claim (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 524-525; People v Stubbs, 110 AD2d 725, 727). While County Court might better have conducted a more specific interrogation of defendant, the basis for his motion was presented, i.e., that the sentence was illegal and that certain defenses had been discovered (cf., People v White, 137 AD2d 859). As indicated, however, the plea minutes confirm that defendant discussed potential defenses with counsel, and further belie any claim of duress. In the final analysis, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea (see, CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Benoit, 142 AD2d 794; People v Howard, 138 AD2d 525).\nJudgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Weiss, Mikoll, Levine and Mercure, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Columbia County affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, following a guilty plea made under a negotiated agreement. The defendant attempted to vacate the plea, arguing that the agreed sentence was unauthorized due to a lack of confirmed prior felony status, but the court found that the reduced sentence still aligned with the plea agreement benefits. Ultimately, the court determined that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to present his claims and did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.<|eot_id|>"}

After the indictments were consolidated, he pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, in full satisfaction, with the understanding that he would receive a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years to life. The plea agreement included a waiver of his right to appeal, which County Court discussed with defendant on multiple occasions, describing the nature of the right and eliciting agreements of defendant\u2019s understanding of that right. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate sentence of 7 years to life in prison and defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal encompasses his challenges to County Court\u2019s audibility ruling, the severity of his sentence and the propriety of the People\u2019s motion to consolidate the indictments (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 769-770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Jimenez, 277 AD2d 956, 956 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 784 [2001]; People v Rodriguez, 238 AD2d 150, 151 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 897 [1997]).

Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, claiming that he had not had enough time to consider the offer and that he was innocent. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and proceeded to sentence him as agreed. Defendant now appeals.\nReview of the record confirms that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. County Court informed defendant of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and the ramifications thereof. Defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights, that he had not been threatened or coerced into entering the plea and that he had been afforded adequate time to discuss his choice with counsel representing him on each of the indictments. Additionally, during the plea colloquy defendant unequivocally admitted the alleged conduct and his subsequent claims of innocence were not substantiated by anything other than his own conclusory statements. Under these circumstances, County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was proper (see People v King, 20 AD3d 580, 581 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 829 [2005]; People v Coss, 19 AD3d 943, 943-944 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 805 [2005]; People v Watson, 8 AD3d 911, 911-912 [2004]). Given defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review his contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Mondore, 18 AD3d 961, 962 [2005]; People v Frazier, 17 AD3d 869, 869 [2005]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804-805 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant pleaded guilty to the criminal sale count in November 2004, and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 41/2 to 9 years in April 2005. In January 2005, following defendant\u2019s conviction, but prior to imposition of his sentence, new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 became effective (see L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]). Defendant now appeals seeking a reduced sentence pursuant to the new sentencing provisions.\n\u201c[T]o the extent that defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to how he was sentenced survived his plea of guilty and the waiver of his right to appeal\u201d (People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 596 [2005]), we find his challenge to be without merit. \u201cWhile, in the absence of evidence of contrary intent, the general rule is to retroactively apply remedial or ameliorative amendments, explicit legislation setting forth a prospective effective date \u2018is sufficient to overcome any presumption of retroactivity\u2019 \u201d (People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676, 677 [2006], quoting People v Sutton, 199 AD2d 878, 879 [1993]). The Legislature specifically addressed the retroactive application of the new sentencing provisions when it directed \u201cthat the new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 \u2018shall take effect on the thirtieth day [January 13, 2005] after [the Act] shall have become a law, and . . . shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof \u201d (People v Walker, supra at 677, quoting L 2004, ch 738, \u00a7 41 [d-1]). Here, defendant committed the acts which are the basis for his conviction prior to the effective date of the new sentencing provisions and, therefore, the new provisions were not applicable (see People v Milner, 28 AD3d 873, 874-875 [2006]).\nCardona, EJ., Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance, rejecting his appeal for a reduced sentence based on new sentencing provisions that became effective after his offense.

Consequently, his constitutional challenge to the sentencing was deemed without merit.<|eot_id|>"}

In return for his acceptance into the judicial diversion program, defendant pleaded guilty as charged (in full satisfaction of both the superior court information and another pending charge) and waived his right to appeal \u2014 both orally and in writing. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement and the judicial diversion contract executed by defendant, defendant was advised that, if he failed to complete the program, he could be sentenced as a second felony offender to a maximum period of 4V2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Following defendant\u2019s two failed attempts at completing the program, the matter was set down for sentencing, and County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s assertion that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. County Court explained the rights that defendant was forfeiting by pleading guilty and distinguished the right to appeal from the trial-related rights that defendant was forgoing; defendant, in turn, communicated his understanding thereof and signed a detailed written waiver in open court (see People v Jakob, 147 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]). \u201cWhile the better practice would have been for the court to specifically ask defendant if he had discussed the appeal waiver with counsel and establish that he had read the written waiver before signing it, considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver, including defendant\u2019s experience, we are satisfied that the oral colloquy, combined with the written waiver, demonstrate his understanding and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal\u201d (People v Empey, 144 AD3d 1201, 1202-1203 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 1144 [2017]; see People v Lavalley, 150 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2017]). Accordingly, the valid waiver precludes defendant\u2019s present claim that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice (see People v McRae, 150 AD3d 1328, 1328 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1093 [2017]; People v White, 96 AD3d 1299, 1300 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1029 [2012]).\nEgan Jr., J.P., Lynch, Aarons, Rumsey and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of St. Lawrence County convicted the defendant of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree following his guilty plea, which included a waiver of his right to appeal. Despite the defendant's claims regarding the validity of this waiver, the court found it to be valid based on the thorough explanation of rights provided and the defendant's understanding of the plea agreement. As a result, the appellate court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the waiver precludes any claims regarding the harshness of the sentence imposed.<|eot_id|>"}

As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal and the People agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 2 to 6 years with diversion to a drug treatment program. Despite a Parker admonition, defendant abandoned the residential drug program and failed to appear for sentencing. Defendant was sentenced in absentia to the promised period of imprisonment. Defendant appeals, contending that his plea was not voluntary, that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel and that the sentence was excessive.\nWe affirm. Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or otherwise vacate the judgment of conviction, any attack on the voluntariness of the plea is unpreserved (see People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914, 915 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 580 [2003]; People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]). Were we to reach defendant\u2019s argument concerning the entry of his plea, we would find it unpersuasive since the record clearly supports the conclusion that the plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see People v Smith, 305 AD2d 853, 854 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 624 [2003]; People v Sampson, 301 AD2d 677 [2003]; People v Keyes, 300 AD2d 909, 909-910 [2002]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]).\nNext, many of the alleged failings defendant points to as supporting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relate to sentencing, not to the voluntariness of the plea, and are precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v De Berardinis, supra at 915; People v Camp, supra at 630). Further, failure of defendant\u2019s attorney to persuade County Court to impose a lighter sentence (particularly in view of defendant\u2019s abandonment of the drug treatment program and his disappearance prior to sentencing) does not constitute ineffectiveness (see People v Smith [Jones] [Tree], 300 AD2d 745, 746 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 616, 620 [2003]).\nFinally, any challenge to the sentence as excessive is precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal (see People v Rea, 305 AD2d 802 [2003]). He waived his right to be considered for youthful offender treatment by failing to request it and, given the totality of defendant\u2019s conduct, no basis exists upon which to exercise our interest of justice powers to consider the issue now (see People v McGowen, 42 NY2d 905, 906 [1977]; People v Richardson [Cheeks], 295 AD2d 704, 704 [2002], lvs denied 98 NY2d 709, 713 [2002]; People v Chaplin, 178 AD2d 685 [1991], lv denied 79 NY2d 945 [1992]).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Spain and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty, waiving his right to appeal as part of a plea deal. The defendant's subsequent claims that his plea was involuntary, he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the sentence was excessive were rejected, as he did not move to withdraw his plea and waived his right to appeal these issues. The court found that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily, and the defendant's failure to adhere to the plea agreement further undermined his claims.<|eot_id|>"}

She pleaded guilty to this charge and waived her right to appeal. She was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to five years of probation. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the SCI is jurisdictionally defective because it does not contain sufficient factual allegations of the material elements of the crime in question. Preliminarily, we note that this claim is not precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of her right to appeal or her guilty plea (see People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]; People v Binns, 82 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2011]). Nevertheless, we find it to be without merit. A charging instrument that incorporates by reference the statutory provisions applicable to the crime charged has been held to allege the material elements of the crime sufficiently to survive a jurisdictional challenge (see People v D'Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 734-735 [2002]; People v Mitchell, 94 AD3d 1252, 1252-1253 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]; People v Binns, 82 AD3d at 1450; People v Downs, 26 AD3d 525, 526 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 847 [2006]). Here, not only does the SCI specifically refer to Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 220.39 (1), but it also contains factual references to the date and location of the incident as well as the specific drug involved. Accordingly, there is no jurisdictional defect and defendant is precluded by her guilty plea from otherwise challenging the factual sufficiency of the SCI (see People v Morales, 66 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2009]).\nRose, J.R, Lahtinen, Spain and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

Consequently, the defendant's plea precluded her from challenging the SCI's sufficiency.<|eot_id|>"}

Under the terms of the plea bargain, the prosecution and defense counsel agreed to a joint sentencing recommendation providing that defendant would be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 10 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. In addition, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court deviated from the joint sentencing recommendation and sentenced defendant as a predicate felony offender to an aggregate prison term of 18 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we note that although defendant waived his right to appeal as part of the plea bargain, the People concede that the waiver included an exception that would permit review of the claims now advanced before us. Specifically, the written waiver provided, as relevant here, that defendant has \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence to be imposed should it be harsher than the sentence the District Attorney and I negotiated and jointly recommended.\u201d Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s arguments implicate only the exception to his waiver of the right to appeal, we address the substance of defendant\u2019s claims.\nPreliminarily, we note that defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2008]; People v Farrington, 51 AD3d 1221, 1222 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 736 [2008]). Nevertheless, even if we were to consider it, we would find it to be without merit. Defendant\u2019s claim that his attorney failed to adequately investigate his mental health history concerns matters outside the record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]; People v Sterling, 57 AD3d 1110, 1113 [2008]). Moreover, the record belies defendant\u2019s assertion that his counsel failed to zealously advocate for imposition of the joint sentencing recommendation as it discloses that defense counsel made a cogent argument to County Court, but that the court chose to impose a greater sentence due to defendant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for his actions. Under these circumstances, we do not find that defendant was denied meaningful representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).\nLikewise, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was not bound to follow the joint sentencing recommendation (see People v Mills, 17 AD3d 712, 713 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]), and the court made defendant aware of this fact during the plea proceedings, also informing him of the maximum potential prison exposure. Notably, the presentence investigation report discloses that defendant has a lengthy criminal record and that he blamed the incident in which he tried to assault his wife on others\u2019 interference in their relationship. Under these circumstances, we do not find that there exists either an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Carter, 40 AD3d 1211, 1213 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 864 [2007]; People v Sieber, 26 AD3d 535, 536 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 853 [2006]).\nCardona, EJ., Mercure, Rose, Malone Jr. and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

She pleaded guilty to that charge in exchange for a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probation. Defendant also agreed to waive her right to appeal and was administered Parker warnings advising her that the agreed-upon sentence would not be honored if she committed another crime prior to sentencing. When it was discovered that the agreed-upon sentence could only be imposed with respect to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant pleaded guilty to that charge.\nThereafter, defendant testified at the trial of her boyfriend against whom various drug charges were pending and indicated that it was her, rather than him, who sold drugs to the undercover police officer on the date in question. As a result of her testimony, the District Attorney requested that defendant\u2019s sentence be enhanced to 2 to 6 years in prison. Upon finding that the plea agreement had not been fulfilled, County Court granted the request and sentenced defendant to 2 to 6 years in prison.\nDefendant asserts that County Court improperly enhanced her sentence based upon her failure to cooperate in the prosecution of her boyfriend, a condition not specified in the plea agreement. Initially, we note that while waivers of appeal are generally enforceable, defendant\u2019s waiver does not preclude her challenge here inasmuch as it \u201cwas predicated upon the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence and should not be enforced where certain conditions or terms were never clearly set forth at the plea proceeding\u201d (People v Haslow, 20 AD3d 680, 680-681 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 828 [2005]; see People v Branch-El, 12 AD3d 785, 786 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 761 [2005]). Furthermore, although defendant did not properly preserve her claim by moving to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]; People v Baxter, 302 AD2d 950, 951 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]), we, nevertheless, exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction given the particular circumstances herein (see CPL 470.15 [6]). Nowhere in this record does it indicate that defendant\u2019s cooperation in the prosecution of her boyfriend was a condition of the plea agreement. Although Parker warnings were administered, they did not include any requirement by defendant with respect to the proceedings against her boyfriend. Consequently, there is no basis for the finding that defendant breached a term of the plea agreement resulting in the imposition of an enhanced sentence (see People v Caldwell, 308 AD2d 658, 659 [2003]; People v Covell, 276 AD2d 824, 826 [2000]). Defendant is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.\nMercure, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Clinton County for resentencing in accordance with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nWe note that, although defendant has been released from prison, she is nonetheless on parole and her appeal is therefore not moot (see People v Stewart, 185 AD2d 381, 382 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 977 [1992]; see also People v Rowell, 5 AD3d 1073 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 806 [2004]; compare People v Wemette, 285 AD2d 729, 731-732 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 689 [2001]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court overturned the enhanced sentence imposed on the defendant for not cooperating in her boyfriend's prosecution, as this condition was not part of her plea agreement. The court ruled that the defendant was entitled to be sentenced according to the original agreement, which involved a six-month jail term and five years of probation, and remitted the case for resentencing. Despite her release from prison, the appeal remains valid since she is still on parole.<|eot_id|>"}

According to the plea agreement, defendant would be sentenced to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision; however, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea in the event the sentence imposed in a pending criminal matter in Washington County did not run concurrently with the proposed sentence in the instant matter. Thereafter, based upon the consecutive nature of the sentence imposed in Washington County, the instant sentence was renegotiated and defendant was sentenced to a prison term of seven years\u2014to run concurrently with the Washington County sentence\u2014followed by two years of post-release supervision.\nInitially, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalidated by the renegotiation of the instant sentence. The record belies defendant\u2019s contention that he withdrew his plea of guilty inasmuch as the sentencing minutes specify that defendant was \u201cnot looking to withdraw the plea.\u201d\nAlthough defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea is not precluded by the waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]), his contention that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 701 [2002]). To the extent that his claim of inef fective assistance of counsel survives the appeal waiver, it is similarly unpreserved (see People v Anderson, 63 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2009]).\nFinally, the appeal waiver precludes defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed (see People v Platero, 63 AD3d 1446, 1446 [2009]; People v Tabbott, 61 AD3d 1183, 1184 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 750 [2009]).\nPeters, Lahtinen, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur.

He also waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to two years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. County Court agreed to release defendant on his own recognizance pending sentencing and advised him that if he violated the conditions of his release, which included testing positive for the use of drugs, the court would not be bound by the sentencing commitment and could sentence him to 2V2 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, defendant tested positive for drug use and County Court sentenced him to 2V2 years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, defendant contends that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he was not advised of potential sentencing consequences prior to entering his plea. Defendant, however, is foreclosed from raising this claim as it does not appear from the record that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Buck, 136 AD3d 1117, 1118 [2016]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]). Moreover, we do not find that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable here given that defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that negated his guilt (see People v Buck, 136 AD3d at 1118; People v Butler, 134 AD3d at 1350). Defendant\u2019s alternative argument that his sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal as County Court advised him of the consequences of violating the release conditions as well as the maximum sentence that could be imposed (see People v Perkins, 125 AD3d 1045, 1047 [2015]; People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 935 [2015]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Clark and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine was affirmed. The defendant argued that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary due to a lack of information on potential sentencing consequences; however, this claim was not preserved as he did not make a necessary postallocution motion. Additionally, his argument regarding the harshness of the sentence was barred by his valid waiver of the right to appeal, which included an understanding of the consequences for violating release conditions.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant and several others were indicted on various drug charges as the result of an investigation conducted in the Greene County area. Defendant was tried and convicted of two sales of heroin and possession of a hypodermic needle. He was sentenced to 3 to 15 years on each of the heroin sales, and received one year on the possession of a hypodermic needle. The sentences were to run concurrently. All of the others indicted, after pleas of guilty, received probationary sentences. The sole issue raised by defendant on this appeal is that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive, particularly in view of the fact that the others were all placed on probation. The imposition of sentence rests with the discretion of the trial court and we should not reduce the sentence unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. (People v. Oaputo, 13 A D 2d 861.) An examination of the instant record reveals testimony that defendant was not an addict, had a substantial job and was a supplier of drugs. Two of the counts were felonies, the other a misdemeanor. Under all of these circumstances we cannot say the court abused its discretion in the sentences imposed. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

However, the court found no abuse of discretion, noting the defendant's role as a drug supplier and lack of addiction, leading to the conclusion that the sentences were appropriate under the circumstances.<|eot_id|>"}

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered October 10, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of driving while ability impaired by drugs.\nIn satisfaction of various charges against him, defendant pleaded guilty in October 2011 to the crime of driving while ability impaired by drugs (see Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [4]). The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would enter, upon acceptance, into the Judicial Diversion Program and that, if he failed to successfully complete the program, he would be sentenced to a prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. In August 2013, after waiving his right to a hearing and admitting that he had absconded from his treatment program in November 2012 and used an illegal drug, he was terminated from the program (see CPL 216.05 [9]). County Court sentenced defendant, as previously agreed to in the Judicial Diversion Program contract, to 2V3 to 7 years in prison.\nDefendant contends that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because, at the time of his plea, County Court failed to explain a direct consequence of his plea\u2014 specifically, the \u201cspecified period\u201d of time that he was required to participate in \u201calcohol or substance abuse treatment\u201d as part of the judicial diversion program (CPL 216.05 [5]; see People v Monk, 21 NY3d 27, 32 [2013]; People v Harnett, 16 NY3d 200, 205-206 [2011]). However, inasmuch as the duration of his treatment regimen was not an \u201cimmediate, definite or automatic result\u201d of his guilty plea but, rather, was fashioned by the judicial diversion program outside of County Court\u2019s control in response to defendant\u2019s particular treatment needs and his ongoing response to that treatment, it was a collateral consequence of his plea subject to the preservation requirement (People v Donovan, 94 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2012] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 184 [2013], cert denied 574 US \u2014, 135 S Ct 90 [2014]; People v Monk, 21 NY3d at 32; cf. People v Colley, 121 AD3d 523, 524 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1161 [2015]; but cf. People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]). Here, defendant made no effort before County Court to call into question the voluntariness of his plea or the Judicial Diversion Program contract and said nothing during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1471 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]). Notably, defendant did not challenge the voluntariness of his plea until this appeal and after having admitted to failing to comply with the terms of the judicial diversion program (see People v Donovan, 94 AD3d at 1231). Thus, defendant failed to preserve his claim for our review (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 182; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231-1232 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1162 [2015] ).\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence as excessive, County Court properly distinguished the waiver of the right to appeal from the rights that defendant had automatically forfeited by virtue of his guilty plea, ensured that defendant understood the rights that he was waiving and had defendant execute a detailed written waiver in open court that indicated, among other things, that he had an opportunity to discuss the waiver with counsel. Accordingly, we find that the appeal waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Jackson, 128 AD3d 1279, 1280 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 930 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1430-1431 [2014]), and, given the valid waiver of appeal, defendant is precluded from challenging his negotiated sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256).\nGarry, Egan Jr., Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of driving while impaired by drugs is affirmed. The defendant contended that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary due to a failure to explain the specifics of his treatment program, but the court found this was a collateral consequence and not preserved for review, as he did not challenge the plea's voluntariness until after admitting to failing the program. Additionally, the court upheld the validity of the defendant's waiver of appeal, which precludes him from contesting the severity of his sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nJudgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed, in accordance with the following memorandum: Upon his plea of guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years and was ordered to pay $1,510 in restitution to the Rochester Police Department. The $1,510 represented unrecovered drug \"buy\u201d money ex pended by the police in effecting defendant\u2019s arrest. For reasons that follow, we conclude that the order of restitution is not authorized by Penal Law \u00a7 60.27, and we vacate that part of defendant\u2019s sentence.\nPenal Law \u00a7 60.27 (1) provides that the sentencing court \"shall consider restitution to the victim of the crime and may require restitution as part of the sentence imposed\u201d. It is the policy of the State \"to encourage restitution by a person convicted of a criminal offense to the victims of his or her criminal activities in appropriate cases and to the extent that the defendant is reasonably able to do so\u201d (legislative findings, L 1983, ch 397, \u00a7 1).\nThe term \"victim\u201d is not defined in Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 and the issue of whether a law enforcement agency is a victim qualified to receive restitution of drug \"buy\u201d money has not been decided at the appellate level in this State. Other jurisdictions have considered the issue. A Nebraska statute expressly provides for the recoupment of \"buy\u201d money from a defendant convicted of a drug offense (see, Neb Rev Stat \u00a7 28-427 [1985]). North Carolina expressly prohibits restitution to government agencies for normal operating costs (see, NC Gen Stat \u00a7 15A-1343 [d]). In jurisdictions where the term \"victim\u201d has specifically been defined, courts have found that a police department is a victim for purposes of restitution (see, e.g., State v Pettit, 73 Ore App 510, 698 P2d 1049, review denied 299 Ore 522, 702 P2d 1112; Commonwealth v Mourar, 349 Pa Super 583, 504 A2d 197, vacated on other grounds 517 Pa 83, 534 A2d 1050). In Illinois, however, where, as here, the applicable statute contains no definition of the term \"victim\u201d, it has been held that a drug enforcement agency is not a victim for purposes of restitution: \"While certainly we would be remiss were we to hold that unlawful delivery of a controlled substance is a victimless crime, we would be blinking reality were we not to acknowledge that many, if not most, offenders are brought to justice through the efforts of undercover agents making buys with public monies. We will not, however, strain the commonly accepted understanding of the word Victim\u2019 so as to include the public drug enforcement agency, MEG, in the case before us. Where public monies are expended in the pursuit of solving crimes, the expenditure is part of the investigating agency\u2019s normal operating costs. The governmental entity conducting an investigation is not therefore considered a Victim\u2019 to the extent that public monies are so expended. Evans v. Garrison (4th Cir. 1981), 657 F.2d 64.\u201d (People v Evans, 122 111 App 3d 733, 740, 461 NE2d 634, 639.)\nHaving found in this State no expression of legislative intent to the contrary, we adopt the compelling analysis of the Illinois appellate court and conclude that defendant was improperly sentenced to make restitution to the Rochester Police Department. That part of the sentence must be vacated. (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court, Marks, J.\u2014 criminal possession of controlled substance, third degree.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P.

Therefore, defendant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s decision was against the weight of the evidence is rejected (see, supra). Furthermore, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the prison sentence of 6 to 12 years as a second felony offender was harsh and excessive. In view of his criminal record and the fact that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines, we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by the court (see, People v Lipinski, 159 AD2d 860, lv denied 76 NY2d 860; People v Hoag, 94 AD2d 921).\nJudgment affirmed.

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years. It was further agreed that sentencing would be delayed for a considerable period of time (apparently because defendant was a few months pregnant). County Court, however, twice advised defendant that if she were arrested during the ensuing time period, it would reserve the right to impose a harsher sentence. She was specifically advised that another arrest could result in consecutive, 5 to 15-year prison sentences.\nWhile awaiting sentencing, defendant was again arrested and charged with additional drug-related crimes. At sentencing on the original charges, County Court was initially willing to accept a plea to the new charges and sentence her to an aggregate prison term of 4 to 12 years for all charges. During a plea allocution on the new charges, however, defendant indicated that she had not had sufficient time to confer with her attorney. County Court therefore refused to accept a plea to the new charges, ignored apparent attempts by defendant and her attorney to revisit the matter and proceeded to sentence her on the original charges. In light of her violation of the no-arrest condition of the plea, County Court sentenced her to consecutive, 2 to 6-year prison terms. She now appeals, and we affirm.\nFirst, having failed to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant\u2019s present argument that her plea was not knowing, intelligent or voluntary is not properly preserved for this Court\u2019s review (see e.g. People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 895 [2006]). In any event, were we to reach the issue, our review of the plea colloquy convinces us that, despite certain misstatements by County Court, defendant indeed knew and understood the precise crimes to which she was pleading guilty, admitted the elements of these offenses and understood the consequences of her plea.\nDefendant next argues that her sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice because it constituted retribution on the part of County Court for her statement during the plea allocution on the new charges that she had not had enough time to confer with her attorney. We are unconvinced that County Court\u2019s imposition of the enhanced sentence\u2014which could have been far greater\u2014was an exercise of retribution. Defendant had been clearly warned that County Court could impose a harsher sentence than that initially agreed upon if she were arrested while out on bail awaiting sentence (cf. id. at 894; People v Donnelly, 23 AD3d 921, 922 [2005]). Moreover, despite the opportunity to do so, neither defendant nor her attorney in any way challenged the validity of her postplea arrest or denied defendant\u2019s involvement therein (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Schnackenberg, 269 AD2d 618, 619 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 925 [2000]; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, 854-855 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 880 [1999]; People v Jackson, 221 AD2d 740, 740-741 [1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 974 [1996]; cf. People v Jenkins, 29 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2006]). Under these circumstances, enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence was certainly appropriate and not the product of vindictiveness on the part of the County Court (see People v Outley, supra).\nMercure, J.E, Peters, Spain and Kane, JJ., concur.

Upon defendant\u2019s demand, the People served a bill of particulars which alleged that the sale and possession crimes both occurred at one specific address in the City of Rensselaer, Rensselaer County. During his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that the possession crime charged in count two of the indictment occurred at a location in Rensselaer that was different from the address specified in the bill of particulars. Defendant moved to dismiss count two of the indictment and the People moved to amend the bill of particulars to allege that the crime charged in count two of the indictment occurred at both locations in Rensselaer. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and granted the People\u2019s motion.\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of the crime charged in count one of the indictment and not guilty of the crime charged in count two. Defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict was denied and he was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years.\nOn this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in permitting the People to amend the bill of particulars in regard to the location of the crime charged in count two of the indictment. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the People changed the theory of the prosecution by altering the address in Rensselaer where the criminal possession of the controlled substance allegedly occurred (see, People v Parker [Clinton], 186 AD2d 157, lv denied 80 NY2d 1029). Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad faith, County Court properly permitted the amendment unless it resulted in undue prejudice to defendant (see, CPL 200.95 [8]; People v Parker [Clinton], supra). County Court offered the defense a continuance and defendant was ultimately acquitted of the crime charged in count two. Nevertheless, defendant maintains he was prejudiced because the amendment insulated count two from dismissal and, therefore, defendant elected not to testify to establish an agency defense as to the crime charged in count one because he did not want to testify about the events encompassed by count two. The argument is meritless.\nEven if count two had been dismissed and defendant had elected to testify, he could have been questioned about his subsequent possession of drugs packaged similar to those sold as part of the crime charged in count one. Such evidence is relevant to defendant\u2019s intent and is admissible to rebut the defense of agency (see, People v Phillips, 197 AD2d 793, lv denied 82 NY2d 929; People v Castaneda, 173 AD2d 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 963; see also, People v Ingram, 71 NY2d 474, 480-481). County Court properly permitted the amendment to the bill of particulars, which also establishes the propriety of County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss count two of the indictment and to set aside the verdict.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention concerns the severity of the sentence, but the sentence was substantially less than the harshest possible, and we see no clear abuse of discretion or other extraordinary circumstances (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\nMercure, J. P., White, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur.

The defendant contended that the County Court erred by allowing the prosecution to amend the bill of particulars regarding the location of the alleged crime, but the court found no undue prejudice and ruled that the amendment was proper. Additionally, the court determined that the sentence imposed was not excessively harsh and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.<|eot_id|>"}

He pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 1 to 3 years in prison. Defendant appeals, contending that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to sentence him as a youthful offender and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive.\nInitially, it was within County Court\u2019s discretion to sentence defendant as a youthful offender and we do not find that the court abused its discretion in declining to do so (see, People v Chapman, 227 AD2d 665, lv denied 88 NY2d 934; People v Young, 224 AD2d 949; People v Diaz, 221 AD2d 749, lv denied 87 NY2d 921). County Court considered the negative recommendation of the Probation Department as well as the serious nature of the crime in making its determination. These were appropriate factors for the court to consider in denying youthful offender status to defendant (see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 334). In addition, we do not find that the sentence imposed is either harsh or excessive given the extent of defendant\u2019s involvement in selling drugs and that defendant specifically agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain (see, People v Young, supra). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb County Court\u2019s judgment.\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, Casey and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Defendant disposed of all three indictments with a plea of guilty to a single count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 12 years and a $5,000 fine. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the sentence imposed by County Court.\nInitially, we reject the contention that the prison sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive (see, People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838), particularly in view of the fact that defendant was on probation for a prior drug offense at the time of commission of the current crime and that, by pleading guilty to a single class C felony, he avoided exposure to consecutive prison terms of 8 Vs to 25 years. We agree with defendant, however, that County Court erred in imposing the $5,000 fine without complying with the requirement of Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 (1) (c) that it \"consider the profit gained by defendant\u2019s conduct, whether the amount of the fine is disproportionate to the conduct in which defendant engaged, its impact on any victims, and defendant\u2019s economic circumstances\u201d. We are not persuaded by the People\u2019s argument that the statutory requirement is inapplicable because defendant was not convicted of a felony defined in Penal Law article 220 but, rather, one defined in Penal Law articles 220 and 110 (see, Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 [1] [c]).\nCardona, P. J., White, Casey and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reversing so much thereof as imposed a $5,000 fine; matter remitted to the County Court of Franklin County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn the case of Mercure, J., the defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

The judgment was modified by reversing the fine and remitting the case for further proceedings.<|eot_id|>"}

The plea was entered with the express understanding that defendant would receive the shortest legally permissible sentence, a prison term of six years to life, and accepted only upon condition that defendant waive her right to appeal. Having been sentenced pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, contending that County Court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle in which she was a passenger.\nThe record provides no basis for a finding that defendant\u2019s waiver of her right to appeal was not knowingly and intelligently made (see, People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958) and we are not persuaded that a defendant\u2019s right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress tangible evidence will survive a valid waiver of appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7; People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, cert denied 423 US 873; People v Scott, supra).

Similar charges were also filed against defendant in Rensselaer County in connection with other drug sales. In satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison, to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision ranging from IV2 to 3 years. The sentence was to run concurrently to the sentence imposed by Rensselear County Court in connection with the charges pending there. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and a three-year period of postrelease supervision was imposed. He now appeals.\nInitially, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, we find that defendant entered a valid waiver of the right to appeal. Although County Court ambiguously stated that the waiver forfeited defendant\u2019s right to appeal \u201ceither the plea or sentence,\u201d the written waiver, which defendant executed in open court, clarified that it encompassed the plea as well as the sentence and defendant indicated that he had discussed it with counsel and understood the consequences of the waiver (see People v Fling, 112 AD3d 1001, 1002 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1020 [2014]). Moreover, County Court properly advised defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Fate, 117 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2014]). Accordingly, under the circumstances presented, we find that the waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Fligger, 117 AD3d 1343, 1344 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1061 [2014]).\nDefendant maintains that County Court failed to comply with an important condition of the plea agreement, which was that his sentence include a provision that he serve time in the Willard drug treatment program just as Rensselear County Court had directed as part of the sentence it imposed. Based upon this, he argues that his guilty plea was not voluntary. Although defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea, he has failed to preserve this claim for review by making an appropriate postallocution motion or by objecting at the sentencing (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]; People v Fate, 117 AD3d at 1328; People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790-791 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]). In any event, there is no support in the record for defendant\u2019s assertion that the plea agreement implicitly included a provision that, upon his incarceration, defendant would participate in the Willard drug treatment program. To the contrary, County Court specifically made it clear that this was not a component of the sentence, a point expressly acknowledged by defense counsel. Lastly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Fligger, 117 AD3d at 1344; People v Fling, 112 AD3d at 1002).\nStein, J.E, Garry, Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance following a guilty plea. Despite the defendant's claims regarding the voluntariness of his plea and the alleged failure to include a drug treatment program in his sentence, the court found that he had validly waived his right to appeal and did not preserve his claims for review. The court concluded that the plea agreement was clear and that the waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, upholding the imposed sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, County Court agreed to place defendant on interim probation for a period of one year and explained that, if successful, he would be sentenced to felony probation. Defendant was advised, however, that if he failed to abide by the terms of his interim probation, he could be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to as much as four years in prison. County Court thereafter placed defendant on interim probation and sentencing was adjourned to January 2014.\nIn January 2014, defendant was charged with violating the terms of his probation by consuming alcohol and being arrested for a new crime. Defendant then appeared before County Court for sentencing and was sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he was not advised of the mandatory postrelease supervision component of his sentence.\nWe reverse. Initially, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his otherwise valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Bolivar, 118 AD3d 91, 93 [2014]; People v Brown, 107 AD3d 1303, 1304 [2013]). Moreover, it was not necessary for defendant to preserve his challenge to the imposition of postrelease supervision under these circumstances (see People v Turner, 24 NY3d 254, 258 [2014]; People v Cornell, 16 NY3d 801, 802 [2011]; People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]). Turning to the merits, it is well settled that, for a defendant\u2019s plea to be knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered into, a court must advise him or her of the direct consequences of a plea prior to sentencing, including the existence and duration of any postrelease supervision requirement (see People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; People v Brewington, 127 AD3d 1248, 1249 [2015]; People v Thomas, 68 AD3d 1445, 1446-1447 [2009]). Here, as the People concede, at the time of his plea, defendant was not properly made aware of the postrelease supervision component of his sentence. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was not a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one and, therefore, the judgment of conviction must be reversed (see People v Brown, 107 AD3d at 1304).\nIn light of this result, we need not reach defendant\u2019s alternative claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nMcCarthy, Egan Jr., Devine and Clark, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of St. Lawrence County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reversed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance, finding that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent because he was not informed of the mandatory post-release supervision component of his sentence. The court ruled that the defendant's challenge to the plea's voluntariness could be raised despite his waiver of the right to appeal, and thus the case was remitted for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<|eot_id|>"}

However, after reviewing the presentence investigation report, the court (Williams, J.) determined that the Willard program was not appropriate and indicated that it would instead sentence defendant to an aggregate term of four years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision. After defendant declined the court\u2019s subsequent offers to allow her to withdraw her plea, the court sentenced her accordingly. Defendant now appeals.\nWhere a court determines that the negotiated sentence is not appropriate, it may impose an enhanced sentence if it first offers the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea (see People v Wilson, 69 AD3d 970, 971 [2010]; People v Haslow, 20 AD3d 680, 681 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 828 [2005]; see also People v Bonville, 69 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2010]). Here, defendant, who was fully informed at the sentencing proceeding of the sentence that County Court intended to impose, repeatedly declined the court\u2019s offers to withdraw her plea and elected to proceed with sentencing. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence (see People v Washburn, 76 AD3d 1120, 1120-1121 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 864 [2011]; People v Wilson, 69 AD3d at 971). Furthermore, given defendant\u2019s criminal history and inability to comply with supervision, we are not persuaded that her substance abuse problems constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of her sentence (see People v Jones, 9 AD3d 686, 687 [2004]; People v Kane, 6 AD3d 986, 987 [2004]; People v Vansickle, 301 AD2d 963, 964 [2003]).\nRose, Malone Jr., Kavanagh and Garry, JJ., concur.

The plea agreement contemplated that, in lieu of sentencing, defendant would enter into the judicial diversion program and that, if she failed to complete the program, she could be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant later admitted to violating the conditions of the judicial diversion program with the understanding that she would be sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of nine years. County Court instructed defendant, however, that she must follow all the rules of county jail pending sentencing, and if she violated those rules, the court would not be bound by the agreement and that she could be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, defendant was found to have violated jail rules. At sentencing, County Court informed defendant that, based upon the rule violations, it was no longer bound to impose the agreed-upon concurrent sentences of nine years. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender, to two consecutive prison terms of nine years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. We reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of her appeal waiver. County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea and informed defendant of the rights that survive the waiver. Defendant confirmed her understanding of the waiver and that she was voluntarily waiving the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]). Defendant also signed written waivers affirming that she had been given sufficient time to discuss the waiver of the right to appeal with counsel (see People v McKenzie, 136 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]). Accordingly, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal her convictions and sentence (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Beverly, 140 AD3d 1400, 1400-1401 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]; People v Murdie, 134 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2015]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, her valid appeal waiver precludes from our review her sole remaining contention on appeal, that the imposed sentence is harsh and excessive, inasmuch as she was informed that a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison could be imposed if she violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Garrow, 147 AD3d 1160, 1162 [2017]; People v Deprosperis, 132 AD3d 692, 693 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1108 [2016]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 970 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 1153 [2016]).\nEgan Jr., J.P., Devine, Clark, Mulvey and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of St. Lawrence County convicted the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, following her guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal.

Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, challenging County Court\u2019s determination of his suppression and Sandoval motions.\nWe affirm. As a preliminary matter, we note that a plea of guilty works a forfeiture of nonjurisdictional defects (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1), including adverse rulings on a Sandoval application (see, People v Otero, 184 AD2d 484, lv denied 80 NY2d 976; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 259-260, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026; People v Crouch, 161 AD2d 834). Therefore, by pleading guilty, defendant has removed from the case any appealable issue concerning the propriety of County Court\u2019s Sandoval ruling (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 7).\nTurning now to the suppression issue, which has been preserved for our consideration by express statutory provision (CPL 710.70 [2]), we conclude that County Court did not err in its determination. The record of the suppression hearing provides ample support for County Court\u2019s conclusion that the challenged statement, made in Hudson City Court at the time of defendant\u2019s arraignment on the felony complaint, was not the product of any questioning but, rather, was spontaneously volunteered after defendant had been fully apprised of his rights (see, e.g., People v Rivers, 56 NY2d 476; People v Wimberly, 145 AD2d 823, 824-825, lv denied 73 NY2d 1024).\nCardona, P.

The charge stemmed from a controlled buy that occurred in the City of Kingston, Ulster County on September 11, 2012, during the course of which defendant allegedly was found to be in possession of 110 glassine envelopes of a substance that field tested positive for heroin. When the parties appeared before County Court in February 2013 for a suppression hearing and jury selection, defense counsel indicated that, despite having rejected prior offers, defendant was interested in accepting a plea. Following an extensive colloquy with County Court, defendant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment and waived his right to appeal in exchange for a sentence of nine years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant\u2019s subsequent pro se motion to withdraw his plea was denied, and County Court thereafter sentenced defendant in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, contending that the waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.\nWe affirm. \u201cWhen an appeal waiver is challenged, the operative question is whether the trial court has confirmed on the record that the defendant understands the terms and conditions of his or her plea agreement\u201d (People v Pope, 129 AD3d 1389, 1389 [2015] [citations omitted]). To that end, the court is \u201cnot obliged to engage in any particular litany or catechism in satisfying itself that a defendant has entered a knowing, intel ligent and voluntary appeal waiver\u201d (People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1131 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). As long as the record reflects \u201cthat there was some judicial examination of the waiver itself\u201d (People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and that the defendant had \u201ca full appreciation of the consequences of such waiver\u201d (People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]), the challenged waiver may be upheld.\nHere, although County Court should have more clearly distinguished defendant\u2019s right to appeal from the remainder of the rights that defendant forfeited upon pleading guilty, the record nonetheless reflects that County Court reviewed the waiver with defendant and obtained the required assurances that defendant fully appreciated the appellate rights that he was waiving (see People v Waite, 120 AD3d 1446, 1447 [2014]; People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1141 [2014]). Notably, during the course of the colloquy between County Court and defendant, defendant \u2014 evidencing his knowledge of the criminal justice system \u2014 inquired as to whether the waiver encompassed only those issues that could be raised upon a \u201cdirect appeal\u201d or extended to CPL article 440 motions and habeas corpus proceedings as well. Following additional discussions with County Court, defendant indicated that he had no further questions and, when County Court urged defendant to pose any inquiries that he may have to counsel prior to proceeding, defendant replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Defendant was presented with a copy of the detailed written waiver of appeal, which was amended to address defendant\u2019s concern regarding his right to pursue certain postplea applications, and was questioned as to his understanding thereof. Again, defendant indicated that he understood everything that had been discussed. Defendant then executed the written waiver \u2014 the text of which expressly delineated the separate and distinct nature of defendant\u2019s appellate rights and confirmed that defendant had been afforded \u201cample opportunity to discuss such rights and [the] waiver with [his] attorney and to address and ask questions of [County] Court regarding them.\u201d Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the record reflects that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his conviction and sentence was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 982-983 [2014]; People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v White, 96 AD3d 1299, 1299-1300 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1029 [2012]; compare People v Pope, 129 AD3d at 1389-1390; People v Ritter, 124 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2015]; People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]).\nAs to defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, certain of the arguments raised by defendant in this regard\u2014 including his assertion that defense counsel failed to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation (see People v Bahr, 96 AD3d 1165, 1166 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1024 [2012]), seek out and interview alibi witnesses (see People v Varmette, 70 AD3d 1167, 1172 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 845 [2010]), pursue certain discovery demands and/or available defenses (see People v Davis, 114 AD3d 1003, 1003 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 962 [2014]), seek sanctions for alleged prosecutorial misconduct (cf. People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]) and explain the collateral consequences of his plea (cf. People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014])\u2014involve matters outside of the record and, as such, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion. To the extent that the balance of defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts upon the voluntariness of his plea, such claim survives the valid appeal waiver but must be preserved by an appropriate postallocution motion (see e.g. People v Moses, 110 AD3d 1118, 1118 [2013]). In this regard, the record reflects that defendant made a pro se motion to withdraw his plea claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that she conspired with the People to procure an \u201cexcessive sentence,\u201d failed to adopt four of defendant\u2019s five pro se motions and neglected to advocate for and secure a favorable plea deal. Accordingly, the additional grounds now advanced by defendant in his pro se brief\u2014 including his assertions that counsel failed to bring certain pretrial motions, neglected to correct inaccurate information relative to defendant\u2019s criminal history and failed to object to County Court\u2019s alleged bias \u2014 are unpreserved for our review, as defendant did not advance these specific grounds in his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Delarosa, 104 AD3d 956, 956 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]; People v Escalante, 16 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]).\nIn any event, \u201c[d]efense counsel was not required to support defendant\u2019s various pro se motions\u201d (People v Blackwell, 129 AD3d 1690, 1691 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 926 [2015]; see People v Jones, 261 AD2d 920, 920 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 972 [1999]; see also People v Adams, 66 AD3d 1355, 1356 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]), and \u201cthe failure to make a particular pretrial motion does not \u2014 per se \u2014 constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d (People v Alnutt, 107 AD3d 1139, 1145 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014]; see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1235 [2012]). Additionally, counsel did endeavor to clarify and correct certain information contained in the presentence investigation report (see People v Orengo, 286 AD2d 344, 344-345 [2001], affd 97 NY2d 739 [2002]) and, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the record falls far short of establishing any colorable claim of judicial bias, thereby obviating any need for counsel to take corrective action in this regard. The record is similarly bereft of any evidence of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to subject defendant to an \u201cexcessive\u201d sentence. In short, inasmuch as defendant \u201creceive [d] an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Vonneida, 130 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; accord People v Jenkins, 130 AD3d 1091, 1091 [2015]), we are satisfied that defendant was afforded meaningful representation.\nFinally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the perceived severity of his sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]), and his assertion that County Court should have assigned substitute counsel to represent him is unpreserved for our review. Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nAlthough the cover sheet of the indictment contains references to crimes with which defendant was not charged and County Court mistakenly inquired as to whether defendant was pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, it is otherwise clear from the record that defendant was charged with and pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Ulster County sentenced the defendant to nine years in prison after he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, related to a heroin possession charge from a controlled buy. The defendant's appeal, claiming that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, was denied, as the court found that the waiver was validly executed and that the defendant was adequately represented. The court affirmed the judgment, stating that the record demonstrated a clear understanding of the plea agreement and rejected claims of counsel's deficiencies as unpreserved or lacking merit.<|eot_id|>"}

On appeal, he contends that County Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the investigator\u2019s identification of him and relatedly argues that such error tainted his subsequent guilty plea. We are unpersuaded.\nUpon our review of the testimony at the Wade hearing, as well as the photographic array utilized by the police in this matter, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied. Testimony at that hearing revealed that approximately three weeks after the investigator purchased cocaine from defendant in a well-lit apartment in the middle of the afternoon, she immediately identified him in a photo array. The investigator testified that she was face to face with defendant that afternoon and was able to clearly observe his facial features. Moreover, the photo array consisted of six males of comparable age and with similar skin tones, facial characteristics and hair styles. In sum, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the photo array was conducted according to proper police procedure and was not unduly suggestive (see People v McDonald, 306 AD2d 696, 697 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661 [2002]).\nFinally, we are also unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence as a second felony offender to 7 to 14 years in prison is harsh and excessive. As part of the plea bargain in this case, the People agreed not to seek persistent felony offender status against him. Moreover, County Court stated on the record during sentencing that it had fully intended to impose the maximum sentence on defendant, but that it would accede to the People\u2019s recommendation of 7 to 14 years. Given these factors, as well as defendant\u2019s criminal history (see People v Fulford, supra), the record discloses no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed and we decline to disturb it.\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

The basis for sentencing defendant as a second felony offender was a February 1993 conviction of reckless endangerment in the first degree, which he admitted. On appeal, defendant claims that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender because neither the predicate felony statement filed by the People nor the sentencing minutes reflects the date he committed his prior felony or served his four-year period of incarceration.\nDefendant correctly states that the second felony offender statement recites that defendant was previously convicted of reckless endangerment in the first degree in February 1993 without referencing the commission date of the prior offense or defendant\u2019s ensuing period of incarceration. At sentencing, however, defense counsel readily acknowledged that he reviewed the presentence report, which clearly reflects that defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment in 1993 for a crime committed in September 1992 and that he was incarcerated between June 1993 and May 1997. Notably, defense counsel denied that the presentence report contained any errors or omissions.\nDefense counsel further acknowledged at sentencing that he had received, and reviewed with defendant, the second felony offender statement and that defendant admitted this prior offense. No objection was raised to any omission in the statement, namely, its failure to state the commission date or defendant\u2019s incarceration. Furthermore, at sentencing, County Court addressed defendant himself, specifically inquiring if he was convicted of reckless endangerment in February 1993 and if he was \u201ca predicate offender for purposes of sentencing.\u201d Defendant answered each inquiry in the affirmative.\nIn our view, the second felony offender statement, coupled with the undisputed facts set forth in the presentence report and all answers to County Court\u2019s inquires by both defense counsel and defendant, establish that defendant had been convicted of a felony offense within the relevant statutory period as tolled by an intervening period of incarceration (see People v McDowell, 56 AD3d 955 [2008]; see also CPL 400.21 [2]; Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]). In other words, there being no actual dispute that defendant indeed served nearly four years in prison between June 1993 and May 1997 and that this period of incarceration adequately tolled the statutory period (compare People v Hilts, 25 AD3d 1019 [2006]), defendant\u2019s sentence will not be disturbed.\nMercure, J.P., Lahtinen, Kane, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

The defendant appealed, arguing that he was illegally sentenced because the predicate felony statement did not include specific dates of the prior offense or incarceration; however, the court found that these details were sufficiently established through the presentence report and the defendant's admissions at sentencing.

He was sentenced to a prison term of IOV2 years to life. Defendant appeals, challenging the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal made in connection with the plea, as well as the severity of his sentence. The record reveals, however, that defendant signed a comprehensive written acknowledgment of his right to appeal and waiver of that right, and that defendant informed County Court during the plea colloquy that his attorney had explained the meaning of the written waiver to him and he understood it. In light of his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the severity of his sentence are precluded (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708 [2005]).\nCrew III, Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to the agreed-upon indeterminate prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals.\nOn appeal defendant claims that his prior felony conviction was not properly admitted into the record (see, CPL 400.21), that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that his sentence is unconstitutional and that County Court erred in sentencing him without ordering a presentence report (see, CPL 390.20 [1]). We find no merit to any of defendant\u2019s claims and affirm his judgment of conviction.\nInitially, the record reflects that County Court received a CPL 400.21 statement from the People reciting defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery in the third degree and reviewed the allegations in that statement with defendant who thereafter admitted through his attorney that he had been legally convicted of that crime. We find that this provided defendant with sufficient notice and an opportunity to controvert the allegations in that statement (see, People v Chrysler, 260 AD2d 945, 945-946; see also, People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142) and does not vitiate defendant\u2019s conviction as a second felony offender.\nNext, defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not previously raised by a motion to withdraw defendant\u2019s plea or to vacate his conviction and thus it is not preserved for our review (see, People v Knoblauch, 275 AD2d 477) and the record reveals nothing which would cause us to invoke an exception to the preservation doctrine (see, People v Alicea, 264 AD2d 900, 901, lv denied 94 NY2d 876).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that his sentence is unconstitutional because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment was also raised for the first time on this appeal and is not preserved for our review (see, People v Harris, 198 AD2d 570, lv denied 82 NY2d 925). Nevertheless, defendant fails to point to any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant our interference with the negotiated sentence (see, People v Smith, 263 AD2d 676, 677, lv denied 93 NY2d 1027).\nFinally, defendant claims that he was improperly sentenced because County Court did not have a presentence report as required by CPL 390.20 (1). Defendant was sentenced on the same day he entered his guilty plea. The record reflects that County Court stated, \u201cI have the probation report and am prepared for sentencing.\u201d Defendant did not object to proceeding with his sentencing and admits in his brief that there was a preplea report from the Probation Department. That document, entitled \u201cPre-Dispositional/Pre-Plea/Pre-Sentence Investigation Report,\u201d contains sufficient information regarding defendant and the charged crime to meet the requirements for such reports set forth in CPL 390.30 (3). Given all these circumstances, we find that defendant\u2019s sentencing was proper and shall not be disturbed.\nCrew III, J. P., Spain, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur.

Defendant argues on appeal that the sentence is harsh and excessive in light of the fact that he received the harshest sentence permissible and would have been eligible for a less severe sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1995 (see, L 1995, ch 3). Given defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal record and the fact that he agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we find this argument to be unpersuasive. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.\nMikoll, J. P., Casey, Yesawich Jr., Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

As a consequence, defendant was arrested and ultimately indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. Following defendant\u2019s unsuccessful motion to suppress the cocaine seized in the search of his vehicle, he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and, as part of the negotiated plea, waived his right to appeal. Defendant thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of 4V2 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nOur review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal, which included the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion (see, People v Collier, 232 AD2d 878, lv denied 89 NY2d 863). Accordingly, we decline to entertain the merits of defendant\u2019s assertion that\" County Court erred in denying his suppression motion. While defendant\u2019s contentions that his plea was not voluntary and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel indeed survive his waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; People v Epps, 255 AD2d 840), we find each assertion to be without merit and, accordingly, affirm.\nMercure, J.

Defendant agreed to plead guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a joint sentencing recommendation of consecutive 1 to 3-year prison terms. During the plea allocution, however, defendant indicated that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the April 30, 1998 sale and could not recall whether he sold the individual one or two packets of cocaine. After further questioning defendant and advising him that his allocution raised a possible issue of criminal intent, County Court adjourned the matter to enable defendant to further discuss his options with defense counsel. Upon returning to court, defendant recited sufficient facts to establish each \u00e1nd every element of the pleaded crimes and, in response to County Court\u2019s inquiries, indicated his understanding that by pleading guilty he was waiving any issues relating to his intoxication or criminal intent. County Court thereafter accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of 1 to 4 years on each conviction. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and, accordingly, his challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review (see, People v Chappelle, 250 AD2d 878, lv denied 92 NY2d 894; People v Stockwell, 243 AD2d 992). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine is inapplicable here because, even assuming that defendant\u2019s initial factual recitation raised a question concerning his criminal intent or the availability of an intoxication defense, County Court satisfied any duty of further inquiry by advising defendant that an issue of criminal intent may have been raised, adjourning the matter to permit further consultation with counsel and subsequently ascertaining that defendant knowingly waived the potential defense (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Pink, 265 AD2d 191, lv denied 94 NY2d 865; People v Williamson, 165 AD2d 686; cf., People v Maldonado, 254 AD2d 574). In any event, were we to review the merits, we would find that County Court properly accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea following the second plea allocution inasmuch as the record reveals that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Snow, 253 AD2d 985, 986, lv denied 93 NY2d 858).\nFinally, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive in view of his young age. We disagree. County Court was not bound by the joint sentencing recommendation of defense counsel and the prosecutor (see, People v Dopp, 261 AD2d 715) and, considering defendant\u2019s significant juvenile and adult criminal history, we discern no basis to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Shabazz, 242 AD2d 764, lv denied 91 NY2d 836).\nCrew III, J. P., Peters, Spain and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance based on his guilty plea. Despite concerns raised about his intoxication and criminal intent during the plea allocution, the court found that he knowingly waived these issues after further consultation with counsel. The court also upheld the consecutive prison sentences imposed, finding them appropriate given the defendant's criminal history, despite his age.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court sentenced defendant to 3V2 years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nFollowing his arrest, defendant was arraigned in City Court without an attorney and remanded to jail. The next day, while still unrepresented by counsel, defendant was given written notice that the grand jury presentment was scheduled for that day and that defendant should notify the District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cas soon as possible\u201d if he wanted to appear before the grand jury. Defendant was indicted within hours on the felony charges and, three days later, he was assigned counsel during his arraignment by County Court. More than nine months later and following numerous court appearances, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to provide proper written notice of the right to appear before and provide evidence to the grand jury pursuant to CPL 190.50 (5) (a), which motion was denied as untimely. Defendant now asserts that, because he was denied his constitutional right to counsel at the time of his arraignment by City Court and during grand jury proceedings, his guilty plea must be vacated and the indictment dismissed.\nThe People maintain that defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal precludes our consideration of defendant\u2019s claim that his right to counsel was violated. A trial court must ensure that a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal is knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1141 [2014]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1259-1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]). After the People informed County Court that defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal, the court asked defendant whether that contention was accurate, to which defendant replied affirmatively. Thereafter, the court questioned defendant about his understanding of the terms of the plea bargain, but failed to confirm that he fully understood that his waiver of appeal was not automatic and that it was, in fact, \u201cseparate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1265 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]). Defendant signed a written waiver of appeal outside of court and County Court made no inquiry about \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the document\u2019s execution\u201d or confirm that defendant had been fully advised by counsel of the document\u2019s significance (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 265). As such, the appeal waiver was invalid (see People v Burgette, 118 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2014]).\nOn the merits of defendant\u2019s appeal, a criminal defendant\u2019s right to receive the assistance of counsel attaches at arraignment \u201cand entails the presence of counsel at each subsequent critical stage of the proceedings\u201d (Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d 8, 20 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Hilliard, 73 NY2d 584, 586 [1989]). Further, whether an accused individual facing felony charges should elect to appear before and present evidence to the grand jury or, as equally relevant here, object to the timeliness or reasonableness of the notice of grand jury proceedings, raises questions necessitating consultation with legal counsel (see Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d at 21; see also People v Chapman, 69 NY2d 497, 500 [1987]; People v Settles, 46 NY2d 154, 164 [1978]; Matter of Trudeau v Cantwell, 31 AD3d 844, 846 [2006]). The People correctly observe that, by pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his claim that he was denied the statutory right to testify before the grand jury (see People v Straight, 106 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2013]; People v Dennis, 223 AD2d 814, 815 [1996], lv denied 87 NY2d 972 [1996]; People v Lasher, 199 AD2d 595, 595 [1993], lv denied 83 NY2d 855 [1994]) or, as defendant now argues on appeal, that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel where, as here, such assertion does not relate to the voluntariness of the plea or the integrity of the plea bargaining process (see People v Mercer, 81 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 999 [2012]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]). Here, however, it is uncontroverted that defendant was denied the right to counsel prior to and during the grand jury proceedings, a critical stage of the instant criminal prosecution and, therefore, the forfeiture rule should not be applied (see People v Hunt, 277 AD2d 911, 913 [2000]; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d 704, 705 [1989]). Further, we observe that, while defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was based solely on the denial of his right pursuant to CPL 190.50 (5) (a) to testify before the grand jury, the \u201cclaimed deprivation of the [s]tate constitutional right to counsel may be raised on appeal, notwithstanding that the issue was not preserved\u201d before County Court (People v Kinchen, 60 NY2d 772, 773 [1983]). Inasmuch as defendant was not afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel \u201cand make an informed decision as to whether to appear before the [g]rand [j]ury\u201d (People v Sawyer, 274 AD2d 603, 606 [2000], affd 96 NY2d 815 [2001]; see People v Fields, 258 AD2d 593, 594 [1999]; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d at 705; People v Lincoln, 80 AD2d 877, 877 [1981]; compare People v Gainer, 73 AD3d 1385, 1386 [2010]), the resulting deprivation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel requires the dismissal of the indictment (see People v Hunt, 277 AD2d at 913; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d at 704).\nLahtinen, J.P, Stein, McCarthy and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and indictment dismissed, without prejudice to the People to re-present any appropriate charges to another grand jury.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court reversed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, citing the denial of his constitutional right to counsel during critical stages of the proceedings, specifically the grand jury process. The defendant's waiver of appeal was deemed invalid due to inadequate confirmation of understanding by the court, and his lack of legal representation at the arraignment and grand jury led to the dismissal of the indictment without prejudice, allowing for the possibility of re-presenting charges to another grand jury.<|eot_id|>"}

In satisfaction thereof, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree without any agreement being made as to sentence. Sentencing was adjourned for six months, during which time defendant was charged with another similar crime. He was ultimately sentenced to three years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nDefendant contends that his counsel was ineffective because he did not set forth on the record the mitigating factors that County Court should have considered with respect to sentencing. Although defense counsel did not specifically enumerate the mitigating factors at sentencing, he brought them to County Court\u2019s attention during the plea proceedings and advocated for the imposition of a one-year jail term. Moreover, pertinent information concerning defendant\u2019s past, including his substance abuse history, was set forth in the presentence investigation report provided to the court. In view of this, and considering that defendant received a favorable plea agreement exposing him to less prison time than he could have received had he been convicted after trial, we find that he was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Watson, 152 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2017], lv denied 30 NY3d 954 [2017]; People v Case, 139 AD3d 1239, 1240 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]). Given defendant\u2019s prior convictions, his commis sion of another drug-related, offense while awaiting sentencing and the fact that no particular sentence was promised as part of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mondolfi, 309 AD2d 975, 975 [2003]).\nLynch, Devine, Clark and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance after waiving indictment and pleading guilty. He claims ineffective counsel for failing to present mitigating factors at sentencing; however, the court determined that his attorney sufficiently addressed these factors and that relevant information was included in a presentence report. The court affirmed the sentence of three years in prison, noting the defendant's prior convictions and a new offense committed while awaiting sentencing did not warrant a reduction.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to four years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. The terms of the plea agreement included the requirement that defendant cooperate with the Probation Department in its preparation of the presentence investigation report, which included answering its inquiries in conformity with his representations during the plea allocution and accepting responsibility for his crime. County Court warned defendant that he could receive an enhanced sentence of up to 12 years in prison if he violated the terms of the plea agreement. At sentencing, defendant acknowledged that he made statements to the Probation Department that were inconsistent with those made during the plea allocution. County Court thereafter found him in violation of the plea agreement and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to 5V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, as the record demonstrates that County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea and defendant acknowledged his understanding of the ramifications of the waiver and executed a written waiver in open court (see People v Fate, 117 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2014]; People v Sczepankowski, 110 AD3d 1115, 1115 [2013]). Defendant\u2019s contention that his guilty plea was involuntary, which survives his appeal waiver, is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Lewis, 118 AD3d 1125, 1125 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1003 [2014]; People v Vandemark, 117 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]). Moreover, defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation rule (see People v Wasley, 119 AD3d 1216, 1216-1217 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1048 [Nov. 25, 2014]; People v Santiago, 118 AD3d 1032, 1033 [2014]). To the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea, it also survives his appeal waiver, but is likewise unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Wiley, 112 AD3d 998, 998 [2013]; People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012]).\nContrary to defendant\u2019s contention, County Court was justified in imposing an enhanced sentence, inasmuch as defendant admittedly violated an explicit condition of the plea agreement (see People v Coffey, 77 AD3d 1202, 1203-1204 [2010], lv denied 18 NY3d 882 [2012]; People v Faulkner, 54 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 854 [2008]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, inasmuch as County Court informed him of the plea conditions and the maximum sentence that could be imposed if he violated the plea agreement (see People v Thomas, 81 AD3d 997, 998 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 900 [2011]; People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 813 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]).\nPeters, P.J., Stein, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement. The defendant violated the terms of the agreement by providing inconsistent statements during the presentence investigation, leading to an enhanced sentence of 5.5 years in prison. The court found that the defendant knowingly waived his right to appeal and that his claims regarding the voluntariness of his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel were unpreserved for review.<|eot_id|>"}

A trial was scheduled but, prior to jury selection, defendant, assisted by counsel, indicated to County Court that he wished to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant subsequently entered a plea of guilty to these charges and also waived his right to appeal. However, he later made a motion to withdraw this plea. Defendant principally claimed in his motion that he agreed to plead guilty under the mistaken belief that he would not be deported following the completion of his sentence. Specifically, he claimed, inter alia, that he had been the target of coercive \"psychological and scary legal tricks and terrorization by the District Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s determination denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. There is no support in the record for defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Slack, 177 AD2d 754, 755, lv denied 79 NY2d 953). Despite defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of coercion and deceptive tactics, the plea minutes make it absolutely clear that defendant\u2019s immigration status was not a condition of the plea that defendant was entering. Moreover, even if, as defendant alleges, he was not advised prior to the entry of his plea of the possibility of deportation, the validity of his plea is not affected (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 401-403). Finally, we have examined defendant\u2019s argument in his pro se brief that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and conclude that he was afforded meaningful representation since he received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the effectiveness of his counsel\u2019s representation (see, supra, at 404).\nCardona, P.

Additionally, the court concluded that the defendant received effective assistance of counsel throughout the process.<|eot_id|>"}

At the hearing, testimony was taken from a representative of the St. Lawrence County Department of Social Services as to the excess amounts received by defendant in public assistance and food stamps; the total amount calculated as being owed was $6,132. Defendant also testified as to his monthly expenses. County Court determined that defendant owed the sum of $6,132 and ordered him to pay it at the rate of $75 per month, with credit for what he had already paid.\nOn appeal, relying on People v Turco (130 AD2d 785, lv denied 70 NY2d 755) and similar cases, defendant contends that County Court erred in not considering any efforts by the Department of Social Services to collect moneys from his girlfriend and that any sums collected from her should have been subtracted from his restitution. Significantly, however, defendant\u2019s girlfriend was not a codefendant. In People v Turco (supra) the Court held that an official designated to receive restitution payments from codefendants in a criminal case is required to report amounts paid by other defendants so as to avoid \"duplicative or inequitable apportionment of restitution payments\u201d among codefendants (see, id., at 787). Here, County Court properly refused to consider evidence with respect to any obligations of the girlfriend or payments by her because she was not before the court and, unlike a codefendant, was not legally responsible for paying restitution. As for the amount of restitution ordered, the issue was explored at length at the hearing, as was the question of defendant\u2019s ability to pay. On the record before us, it cannot be said that the amount or the method of payment was improper or unfair (see, People v Hendrickson, 227 AD2d 801).\nMercure, J.

Defendant was sentenced to 180 days in jail and five years\u2019 probation. We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention on appeal that the condition of probation precluding any contact with the inmate to whom she tried to smuggle the drugs violates her constitutional right of freedom of association. A court has broad discretionary powers to set the conditions of probation which it \u201cdeems reasonably necessary to insure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him [or her] to do so\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [1]) and which are \u201cnecessary or appropriate to ameliorate the conduct which gave rise to the offense\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [5]). Defendant\u2019s relationship with the inmate in question marked the onset of her criminal activity and the record establishes that defendant planned to continue the relationship despite the inmate\u2019s manipulation and negative influence. Under these circumstances, it is our view that the no-contact condition of defendant\u2019s probation was reasonably related to her rehabilitation (see People v Page, 266 AD2d 733, 735 [1999]; People v Griffith, 239 AD2d 705 [1997]; People v Howland, 145 AD2d 866 [1988]).\nCrew III, J.P., Carpinello, Mugglin, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nMain, J.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered February 13, 1974, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony, and sentencing him, pursuant to section 70.06 of the Penal Law, as a second felony offender.\nOn September 17, 1973, defendant was arrested in the City of Albany and charged with criminal possession of marijuana in violation of subdivision 10 of section 220.09 of the Penal Law, a class C felony. Following his indictment and arraignment, he entered a plea of not guilty and moved to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. When this motion was denied, he changed his plea to one of guilty and came on for sentencing.\nPrior to the imposition of sentence, it was established that defendant had been convicted of possession of marijuana in Harris County in the State of Texas on March 9, 1972 and that he had been sentenced therefor to five years in prison with the period of confinement suspended and probation imposed for five years. In view of this fact and in an obvious reference to section 70.06 of the Penal Law, the trial court stated at the time of sentencing that it was \"obliged under the circumstances of this case * * * by virtue of the prior felony conviction in the State of Texas\u201d to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to a maximum term of six years and a minimum term of three years in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services.\nOn this appeal, defendant argues that section 70.06 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional as applied to him because its application denies him the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by both the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const, 14th Arndt; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 11) and also results in the delegation of legislative authority by the Senate and Assembly to Legislatures of other jurisdictions in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution. We agree.\nEnacted as part of a crime-controlling legislative package aimed at eliminating the illicit trafficking in and consumption of narcotics in this State, the questioned statute herein deals with the sentencing of second felony offenders. In pertinent part it provides that, to be a predicate felony, a prior conviction in a jurisdiction other than New York must have been for an offense for which a term of imprisonment in excess of one year or a sentence of death was authorized, irrespective of whether such sentence was imposed (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [i]).\nAs becomes readily apparent upon a perusal of some of the unusual laws on the statute books of other jurisdictions, the implementation of this provision would serve to deprive defendants with prior out-of-State convictions of the equal protection of the laws. For example, convictions for vagrancy (RI Gen Laws, \u00a7 11-45-1), blasphemy (NJ Stat, \u00a7 2A: 140-2), or the theft of a turkey (Ark Stat, \u00a7 41-3916.1), if obtained in the proper jurisdiction, would mandate second felony offender status under the present statute for one later convicted of a New York felony. That such a result would be purely arbitrary and without a basis in reason is amply demonstrated by the fact that, had defendant fortuitously performed these very same earlier acts in the State of New York, he would still be entitled to first offender status upon his sentencing for his subsequent New York felony conviction.\nDefendant\u2019s further argument, that this statute violates the constitutional provision vesting the legislative power of the State of New York in the Senate and Assembly (NY Const, art III, \u00a7 1), is likewise persuasive. This power includes the responsibility for prescribing the proper punishment for the various criminal offenses (People v Blanchard, 288 NY 145) and, since it cannot be delegated to any other legislative body (Burke v Kern, 287 NY 203), the term of imprisonment authorized for an offense in another jurisdiction cannot serve as the basis for determining the extent of the punishment to which a defendant is subject upon his felony conviction in New York.\nBy virtue of the above considerations, we are compelled to declare section 70.06 of the Penal Law unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void, insofar as it. provides that the extent of punishment for a convicted New York felon is dependent upon the authorized sentence for an offense of which he has previously been convicted in another jurisdiction. In so holding we note that the constitutional questions considered herein were previously discussed in a well-reasoned and carefully researched opinion with which we are in complete agreement (People v Mazzie, 78 Misc 2d 1014), and that defendant did not waive his right to mount his constitutional challenge by failing to proceed under CPL 400.21 for a determination as to whether or not he was a second felony offender. Those procedures involve factual determinations as to defendant\u2019s past history of convictions which is not in dispute and has no bearing on the constitutionality of section 70.06 of the Penal Law.\nThe judgment should be reversed, on the law, to the extent of vacating the sentence imposed on February 13, 1974, and the matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for resentencing defendant as a first felony offender.\nSweeney, J, P., Kane, Larkin and Reynolds, JJ., concur.\nJudgment reversed, on the law, to the extent of vacating the sentence imposed on February 13, 1974, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for resentencing defendant as a first felony offender.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court reversed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County that convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and sentenced him as a second felony offender. The court found section 70.06 of the Penal Law unconstitutional, as it violated the principles of equal protection and improperly delegated legislative authority, resulting in arbitrary sentencing based on out-of-state convictions. The case was remitted for resentencing as a first felony offender.<|eot_id|>"}

On appeal defendant claims that the sentence to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum of not less than four years and a maximum of natural life, as mandated by section 70.00 of the Penal Law for violation of subdivision 1 of section 220.39 of the Penal Law, violates his constitutional rights under the United States and New York Constitutions as cruel and unusual punishment and in violation of due process and the equal protection of the law; that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel; that prosecution witnesses gave inadmissible evidence and that the Assistant District Attorney made unwarranted and prejudicial statements in his summation. This court recently decided in People v Venable (46 AD2d 73) that the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under section 70.00 of the Penal Law for the criminal sale of narcotic substances does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions. The defendant was represented on the trial by counsel retained by him. The record discloses a vigorous defense. Counsel made motions to inspect the Grand Jury minutes, to suppress identification testimony and to suppress oral statements and real evidence. The transcript demonstrates lengthy and penetrating cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel. Defendant was adequately represented (People v Tomaselli, 7 NY2d 350). The court finds no reversible error in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses concerning the statements made by the defendant at the time of the transaction or in the summation of the Assistant District Attorney. The defendant is entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect trial (People v Kingston, 8 NY2d 384). Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J.

Pursuant to a plea agreement that required his cooperation with the investigation and satisfied all 21 felony counts against him in the indictment, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under count 92 and waived his right to appeal. Consistent with County Court\u2019s promise that the sentence would be capped at seven years with three years of postrelease supervision, the court imposed a prison sentence of 6V2 years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, defendant\u2019s argument that his waiver of appeal was not knowing, voluntary or intelligent is contradicted by the record, which reflects that County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the trial rights automatically extinguished by the guilty plea, and confirmed that defendant understood the waiver, had voluntarily agreed to it, and had read and signed a written waiver of appeal after discussing it with counsel (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Martinez, 130 AD3d 1087, 1088 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]). While defendant\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea as involuntary survives his waiver of appeal, it was not preserved for our review given the absence of any evidence that he raised this claim in an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Hudson, 130 AD3d 1320, 1320 [2015]; People v Dozier, 115 AD3d 1001, 1001 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1083 [2014]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was not triggered, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or that called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 364 [2013]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). In any event, were we to consider this claim, we would find that it is unsupported by the record.\nDefendant\u2019s allegations regarding what counsel advised him or investigated are outside the record on appeal and, as such, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion to vacate (see People v Trimm, 129 AD3d 1215, 1216 [2015]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed, which was below the promised cap, was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Estrada, 102 AD3d 1064, 1065 [2013]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea as part of a plea agreement. The defendant's appeal was dismissed due to a valid waiver of appeal, which was deemed knowing and voluntary, and his challenge to the plea's voluntariness was not preserved for review. The court also found no merit in claims regarding ineffective counsel or the harshness of the sentence, which was below the agreed cap.<|eot_id|>"}

Prior to the commencement of a Dunaway/Mapp/Huntley hearing, defendant was offered a prison term of 41/2 to 9 years which would be withdrawn once the suppression hearing began. After confer ring with his attorney, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, acknowledging that he had an opportunity to speak with his attorney and was satisfied with his representation. The colloquy reflects that defendant understood that he was giving up certain rights associated with a jury trial, acknowledged that he was not forced or threatened into pleading guilty, and specifically understood that he was giving up his right to a suppression hearing. County Court also elicited an appeal waiver from defendant, and defendant admitted that he possessed more than one eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years, defendant appealed. This Court rejected a previous Anders brief (9 AD3d 740 [2004]), new counsel was assigned, and we now affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea, while not encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal, is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Hughes, 3 AD3d 736, 736 [2004]; People v Ward, 2 AD3d 1219, 1219 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 808 [2004]). Even considering defendant\u2019s challenge, we find that the plea was in all respects knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Willis, 3 AD3d 793, 793-794 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 766 [2004]; People v Hughes, supra at 736). The fact that County Court would not extend the offer once the suppression hearing began does not support the inference that the plea was coerced (see People v Coleman, 8 AD3d 825, 826 [2004]).\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that his arrest was unlawful does not survive his knowing and intelligent guilty plea and unqualified waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911 [1990]; People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688 [1986]; People v Atwood, 9 AD3d 512, 513 [2004]). Moreover, defendant was specifically advised that his plea would waive his right to a suppression hearing (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d 746, 747 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 650 [2004]). Similarly, his challenge to the sentence, which was imposed exactly as agreed in the plea, does not survive his waiver of appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Kalenak, 2 AD3d 902, 903 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 629 [2004]; People v Bier, 307 AD2d 649, 651 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]).\nWe have reviewed defendant\u2019s remaining claims, including those raised in his pro se submission, and find that they are precluded by his valid appeal waiver and otherwise lack merit.\nCarpinello, Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

The terms of the plea agreement called for a sentence of 2 Vi to IV2 years\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, however, defense counsel implored County Court to consider imposing a more lenient sentence, emphasizing that the presentence report recommended a term of probation. The court declined the request stating, in substance, that it was bound by the terms of the plea agreement. Defendant was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain.\nOn this appeal, defendant urges that we reduce the sentence in the interest of justice since this is her first offense, she is the 21-year-old mother of three children and she is the victim of a cocaine addiction. Instead, however, we are required to vacate the sentence imposed due to County Court\u2019s failure to exercise its independent discretion at sentencing (see, People v Graybosch, 139 AD2d 664; People v Montoya, 138 AD2d 528). It is fundamental that a court retains discretion to impose an appropriate sentence notwithstanding the terms of a plea agreement and must exercise that authority (see, People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302). As such, the case must be remitted to County Court for resentencing. Given the procedural posture of this case, should County Court deem a more lenient sentence appropriate, the People must be accorded an opportunity to withdraw their consent to the waiver of indictment (see, CPL 195.10 [1] [c]; cf., People v Farrar, supra, at 307-308).\nJudgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed, and matter remitted to the County Court of Rensselaer County for resentencing.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered January 7, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).\nThe issue here is whether County Court can enhance a sentence when defendant breaches a specific condition of a plea negotiation, which, in this instance, was to pay a fine. In satisfaction of three indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree. Defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender on all three counts. Specifically, with regard to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, defendant was promised a prison sentence of 316 to 7 years conditioned on him paying a $2,000 fine at sentencing. On the remaining drug-related count and the firearm count, defendant was promised a prison sentence of 2 to 4 years and 3 Vi to 7 years, respectively; all sentences were to run concurrently with one another. Defendant was also to pay $270 in restitution. County Court ordered a presentence investigation and instructed defendant that if it were unable to fulfill the agreed-upon sentence, it would allow defendant to withdraw his plea.\nAt sentencing, defendant\u2019s counsel informed County Court that defendant was unable to pay the $2,000 fine and requested that the court permit a withdrawal of defendant\u2019s plea. The request was denied and, as a result of his inability to pay the fine, defendant\u2019s sentence on one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was increased from 3Vi to 7 years\u2019 imprisonment to &\\6 to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced on the remaining two charges as agreed upon and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $270.\nIt has been held that a sentence can be enhanced if defendant violates explicit conditions of plea negotiation (see, People v Dickerson, 110 AD2d 846, lv denied 66 NY2d 762). If a court is unwilling or unable to sentence a defendant in accordance with its promise, the defendant must be given an opportunity to withdraw the plea (see, People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). The record does not indicate that defendant was advised that a harsher sentence would ensue should he be unable to fulfill the financial conditions of the plea, nor can it be implied otherwise from the record. County Court conducted no inquiry as to the reason for defendant\u2019s failure to pay the $2,000 fine. We note that the probation report indicates that defendant is indigent. County Court deprived defendant of an opportunity to explain the factor that caused the court to increase his prison sentence, a practice of which this Court does not approve (see, People v Banks, 161 AD2d 957).\nMercure, Crew III, White and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentences imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Clinton County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reviewed a case where the defendant\u2019s sentence was increased due to his inability to pay a $2,000 fine, a condition of his plea agreement.

Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (six counts) and money laundering in the fourth degree. In return, he was promised that if he cooperated with the People and testified against his codefendants, the prison sentence to be imposed would not exceed 12 years. However, the terms of the plea agreement provided that, if defendant failed to fully cooperate and, in particular, refused to testify against any codefendant, he could receive up to 24 years on his conviction for one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count two), as well as an aggregate prison term of 12 years for his remaining convictions. Subsequently, defendant indicated that he would not testify at any trial of his codefendants and, prior to sentencing, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to a 24-year prison term on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count two), and directed that it run consecutively to the aggregate 12-year prison term it imposed for defendant\u2019s remaining convictions, plus five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant claims that his plea was involuntarily entered because he was coerced into entering a guilty plea and, in particular, was never advised by County Court that his sentence would include a term of postrelease supervision. Initially, we note that while defendant executed a valid waiver of his right to appeal, he may still challenge the integrity of his guilty plea on the ground that it was involuntarily entered (see People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010]; People v Turner, 27 AD3d 962, 962 [2006]).\nAs for his plea, even though County Court conducted the plea allocution in two separate court appearances with defendant over a four-day period, it never advised defendant that a term of postrelease supervision would be part of his sentence. Instead, the court chose to rely on a letter by the District Attorney sent to defendant\u2019s counsel to outline the parameters of the sentence to be imposed pursuant to this plea agreement. Notably, nowhere in this letter is there any indication that postrelease supervision would be part of defendant\u2019s sentence. And, while the District Attorney made brief reference to postrelease supervision during the plea proceedings and defendant may, at some level, have been aware at the time he entered his plea that he would be placed on postrelease supervision at the end of his prison sentence, County Court remained obligated, prior to accepting his guilty plea, to conduct a plea allocution during which defendant agreed and understood that postrelease supervision would be part of the proposed sentence (see People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]; People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; People v Raymond, 81 AD3d 1076, 1076 [2011]; People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010]).\nFurther, while a court need not follow any particular litany when taking a guilty plea, it should conduct a plea allocution that, at the very minimum, identifies the fundamental rights that a defendant is forfeiting by entering such a plea and detail the essential terms of the sentence to be imposed pursuant to any plea agreement (see generally People v Green, 82 AD3d 1453 [2011]; People v Taylor, 82 AD3d 1291, 1292 [2011]; People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011]; People v Rush, 79 AD3d 1522, 1522-1523 [2010]; People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Strickland, 77 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2010]). Here, County Court limited its description of the proposed sentence to a blanket reference to the District Attorney\u2019s letter and a statement that if defendant failed to abide by the obligations he assumed under the agreement, the court would \u201cbe free to sentence [him] to any sentence up to 24 years in prison.\u201d The court never indicated during the plea allocution that the prison sentences to be imposed in such a circumstance could be served consecutively, or that it retained the right, if defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement, to impose a prison sentence not to exceed 36 years. As a result, defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction must be reversed.\nPeters, J.P, Spain, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, plea vacated, and matter remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.\nWe note that we have previously had to vacate pleas and reverse underlying convictions in other cases where County Court similarly accepted guilty pleas without being assured, as a result of the plea allocutions, that defendants were fully aware of and agreed to the proposed sentences (see People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court reversed the judgment convicting the defendant of multiple crimes, including conspiracy and drug possession, due to the inadequate plea allocution process. The County Court failed to properly inform the defendant that his sentence would include postrelease supervision and did not clearly outline the terms of the plea agreement, leading to the conclusion that his guilty plea was involuntary. The case has been remitted for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crime charged and subsequently was sentenced, as a predicate felon, to the agreed-upon prison term of 3\u00bd to 7 years. Defendant now appeals, contending that his plea was involuntary and his sentence is harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. By failing to make the appropriate motion before County Court (see CPL 220.60 [3]; 440.10), defendant has neglected to preserve for our review any issues concerning the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Moore, 8 AD3d 750 [2004]; People v Leabo, 2 AD3d 1213, 1213 [2003]). Regardless, our review of the minutes of the plea colloquy persuades us that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Defendant affirmatively admitted to committing acts constituting the charged crime (see People v Rivera, 266 AD2d 576, 577 [1999]; People v Partridge, 242 AD2d 788, 789 [1997]) and expressed a cogent understanding of the rights he was relinquishing by operation of his plea. Finally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his bargained-for sentence has been waived by execution of his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Bishop, 8 AD3d 691 [2004] ; People v Wagoner, 6 AD3d 985, 986 [2004]).\nPeters, Carpinello, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738) seeking leave to withdraw as counsel on grounds that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal.\nWe agree. A review of the record establishes that the minimum term on the criminal sale convictions, i.e., 8 Vs years in prison, was less than the harshest possible, that defendant knew he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed and raised no objections to it at the time of sentencing. In light of this, along with the fact that the crimes to which defendant pleaded guilty establish his involvement in an ongoing criminal narcotics enterprise, we find no basis to disturb the sentences imposed (see, People v Porter, 197 AD2d 728; People v Gonzalez, 178 AD2d 850, lv denied 79 NY2d 948; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Accordingly, the application for leave to withdraw as counsel is granted (see, People v Franklin, 173 AD2d 960) and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\nMercure, J.

On August 18, 1978, the defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class AI felony, and one count of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, a class D felony. Following his arraignment on this indictment on August 24, 1978, to which defendant entered a plea of not guilty, he was released on $25,000 bail. Subsequently, on March 23, 1979, the defendant was indicted for robbery in the first degree, in two counts (class B felonies), which were allegedly committed while the defendant was on bail pending trial of his prior offenses. Prior to June 11, 1979, the trial date set for the indictment for robbery, the defendant\u2019s competent and capable retained attorneys commenced negotiations with the District Attorney\u2019s office for a bargained plea in satisfaction of both indictments. The District Attorney\u2019s office required a plea to one count of robbery in the first degree on the second indictment and a reduced plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree plus a waiver of a suppression issue that was pending in connection with the first indictment. In return, the District Attorney\u2019s office would recommend sentences of one year to life on the first indictment and 5 to 15 years on the second, the sentences to run consecutively. This offer was fully explained to the defendant as an affidavit signed by the defendant and prepared by his attorneys attests. On June 11, 1979, the date scheduled for trial on the robbery charges, the defendant informed the court he wished to plead guilty. The prosecutor set forth the prior negotiations on the record and the defendant detailed his participation in the crimes, the voluntariness of his plea and his waiver of a jury trial thereby. In the colloquy with the court, the defendant admitted certain details of the robbery, but denied active participation with intent to forcibly steal. The defendant indicated, however, that he wished to plead. The court, however, refused to accept it, as did the prosecution who urged the case to proceed to trial.The defendant and his attorneys then retired to the privacy of a room for consultation and thereafter the defendant returned to court and admitted his full participation in Count No. 1 of the robbery indictment; that he had discussed the plea with his attorneys; that he realized the maximum that could be imposed and he desired to plead guilty. Upon doing so, he was sentenced to a term of one year to life on the first indictment and 5 to 15 years on the second. The sentences, however, were ordered to be served concurrently, an additional benefit to the defendant who bargained for consecutive sentences. The defendant\u2019s contention now that he was denied effective representation of counsel; that his plea of guilty to robbery should not have been accepted since the defendant disclosed facts inconsistent with such plea; that the sentence imposed was excessive and should be vacated; all lack merit or factual substantiation (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338; People v St. Mary, 55 AD2d 968). Judgment affirmed. Sweeney, J. P., Staley, Jr., Main, Mikoll and Casey, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Broome County affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and robbery in the first degree, following his guilty plea. The defendant had initially pleaded not guilty to prior charges but later negotiated a plea agreement that resulted in a reduced charge and a concurrent sentence of one year to life for the robbery and 5 to 15 years for the drug charge. The court rejected the defendant's claims of ineffective counsel and excessive sentencing, finding them to lack merit.<|eot_id|>"}

As part of his negotiated plea, defendant signed a stipulation forfeiting $337,720 that was allegedly seized in relation to the crimes charged. Sentenced pursuant to his plea agreement to a prison term of eight years with two years of postrelease supervision, defendant now appeals.\nDefendant initially contends that his plea was not voluntary, as he was rushed into agreeing to its terms without fully understanding the rights that he was giving up or the ultimate consequences of the plea. This contention is unpreserved for our review, given defendant\u2019s failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Royce, 122 AD3d 1008, 1009 [2014]; People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]). In any event, the transcript of the plea colloquy establishes that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pleaded guilty, after being provided with sufficient time to discuss the plea with his counsel and to consider its implications (see People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [Apr. 9, 2015]; People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1229-1230 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [Apr. 23, 2015]). Defendant further contends that he did not understand the consequences of his appeal waiver and it is therefore invalid. While defendant was not required to preserve his challenge to the voluntariness of his appeal waiver (see People v Crump, 107 AD3d 1046, 1046-1047 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1014 [2013]), we conclude that defendant likewise knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal, and that he understood the consequences of the waiver (see People v Kormos, 126 AD3d 1039, 1039 [2015]; People v Sibounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1059-1060 [2015]).\nWe also find without merit defendant\u2019s argument that the funds forfeited as part of his guilty plea should be returned to him due to the People\u2019s failure to follow the procedure required by Penal Law \u00a7 480.10. As an initial matter, defendant\u2019s challenge to the forfeiture is waived both by his written forfeiture stipulation and his valid appeal waiver (see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2012]; People v Sczepankowski, 293 AD2d 212, 214-215 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 564 [2002]; see also People v Abruzzese, 30 AD3d 219, 220 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 784 [2006]). Furthermore, defendant incorrectly argues that this is a criminal forfeiture pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 480.10, although he was clearly advised during his plea colloquy of the civil nature of the forfeiture and he stipulated to a release of the subject funds pursuant to CPLR article 13-A as a negotiated aspect of his plea agreement (see CPL 220.50 [6]; People v Carmichael, 123 AD3d 1053, 1053 [2014]). Finally, \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver precludes his argument [ ] that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive\u201d (People v Toback, 125 AD3d at 1061; see People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014]).\nLahtinen, J.P., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court convicting the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea. The defendant's claims that his plea was involuntary and that he did not understand the appeal waiver were deemed unpreserved and without merit, as the plea colloquy demonstrated that he made the plea knowingly and voluntarily. Additionally, challenges to the forfeiture of funds and claims regarding the harshness of the sentence were also dismissed due to the valid appeal waiver.<|eot_id|>"}

She thereafter failed to complete the program and, as a result, County Court sentenced her to a prison term of 2V2 to 7 years. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nDefendant argues, and the People concede, that the sentence of 2V2 to 7 years is illegal. Based upon our review of the record and Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 (1) and (3) (b), as it read in November 2003 when defendant committed her crime, we agree. The sentence imposed was impermissible inasmuch as the minimum period of imprisonment was greater than one third of the maximum (see Penal Law former \u00a7 70.00 [1], [3] [b]). Accordingly, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing. In light of our disposition, we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining claim that the sentence was harsh and excessive.\nMercure, J.P., Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

On appeal, this Court found the sentence to be illegal and, consequently, vacated the sentence and remitted the matter to County Court for resentencing (People v Warren, 74 AD3d 1639 [2010]). Thereafter, defendant withdrew his previous plea and entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 10 years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s contention that County Court abused its discretion in not updating defendant\u2019s presentence investigation report prior to sentencing is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not request an updated report or move to vacate resentencing (see People v Cerohe, 75 AD3d 835, 836 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 850 [2010]; People v Sander, 47 AD3d 1012, 1013 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 844 [2008]). In any event, defense counsel specifically requested that the court proceed to sentencing without an updated presentence report, stating that nothing had changed from the time the court initially sentenced defendant on his prior plea \u2014 other than defendant\u2019s participation in certain programs that defense counsel placed on the record. Furthermore, upon our review of the record, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive or that extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant a reduction thereof (see People v Dolison, 23 AD3d 844, 845 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention has been considered and found to be without merit.\nSpain, J.E, Rose, Kavanagh, Stein and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Defendant now appeals.\nAppellate counsel for defendant requests that he be relieved of his assignment on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be advanced on appeal. Having reviewed the record, however, we are instead required to vacate the unauthorized sentence imposed. Specifically, defendant, who is not a predicate felon, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1]), and a determinate sentence of three years was thereafter imposed pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 (2) (a) (i). As a result, the permissible period of postrelease supervision could not be \u201cless than one year nor more than two years\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.45 [2] [b]) and, therefore, the three-year period imposed herein is illegal (see e.g. People v Therrien, 78 AD3d 1331, 1331-1332 [2010]).\nWhile this issue was not raised before County Court or on appeal, we nevertheless must vacate the illegal sentence and remit the matter \u201cfor resentencing with the opportunity for both parties to withdraw from the plea agreement\u201d (People v Warren, 74 AD3d 1639, 1640 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).

Defendant, however, has failed to preserve this claim for our review in light of the fact that he specifically waived his right to appeal the sentence as part of his guilty plea (see, People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673; People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893). Notably, defendant does not contend, nor would the record support a contention that his plea was entered into involuntarily. In any event, were we to consider the merits, we would find that the sentence is neither harsh nor excessive in view of defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, which includes a drug-related conviction, and the fact that the sentence agreed upon relieved defendant of significant jail time exposure.\nCardona, P.

As part of the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a term of 15 years to life in prison. He raises a number of claims on appeal, the most prominent of which is that the plea allocution was insufficient because it failed to establish that defendant knowingly possessed four ounces or more of cocaine. Initially, insofar as the record discloses that defendant entered into a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal in connection with the plea agreement, we find that defendant may not now seek to challenge the sufficiency of the plea allocution. In any event, even if defendant did not waive his right to appeal, defendant failed to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the plea allocution for review. Significantly, he did not raise an objection to the adequacy of the plea as to his knowledge of the weight of the cocaine or to County Court\u2019s inclusion of the drug analysis report in the record (see, People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10).

Upon defendant\u2019s plea, it was understood that he should receive an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 6 to 12 years and pay restitution in the amount of $180. Defendant acknowledged in open court, in response to County Court\u2019s question, the rights that he was forfeiting by his plea. Defendant further acknowledged that he had discussed the matter thoroughly with his attorney, that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation and that he had not been persuaded, threatened or coerced into pleading guilty. Defendant further accepted the proposed sentence which was offered and which was imposed after his plea. Defendant, after conferring with his attorney, stated that he was willing to waive his right to appeal and all other rights that the court informed him of.\nOn this appeal, defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary. We find this claim untenable. Defendant made no effort to preserve his claim at the time of his plea and failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction. Defendant, therefore, failed to preserve his claim (see, People v Negron, 193 AD2d 976, lv denied 82 NY2d 757). In any event, the record establishes a knowing and intelligent waiver of defendant\u2019s right to appeal.\nDefendant also attempts to raise for the first time on this appeal a claim that his legal representation was ineffective. Having expressed his satisfaction with his attorney at the time of his plea, defendant has failed to show any conflict of interest on his attorney\u2019s part that \"affected, or operated on, or [bore] a substantial relation to the conduct of the defense\u201d (People v Ortiz, 76 NY2d 652, 657). Defendant received the prison sentence of 6 to 12 years he agreed to, and the plea and sentence were beneficial to defendant. We find no reason to disturb it (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nDefendant also objects to the restitution ordered by the judgment. Prior to November 1, 1991, County Court lacked the authority to order restitution to a law enforcement agency for unrecovered funds used in the purchase of drugs as part of an investigation leading to a conviction (see, People v Rowe, 75 NY2d 948). Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9) was added to authorize such restitution. Defendant contends that the law enforcement agency seeking restitution in this case failed to file the affidavit required by Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9). We conclude, however, that the filing of the affidavit is not a matter that affects the court\u2019s authority to order restitution, but relates to the amount of the restitution. After defense counsel noted that he had seen no restitution figures other than those stated by the District Attorney, defendant was advised that he had a right to a hearing on the amount of the restitution and that one would be held if he disputed the $180 figure stated by the District Attorney to have been expended by the undercover officers in the investigation of defendant\u2019s drug-selling activities which resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction. Defendant expressly consented to the amount. In these circumstances, we conclude that County Court did not err in ordering restitution in an amount to which defendant consented (see, People v Lugo, 191 AD2d 648). We reach a contrary conclusion as to the 5% surcharge ordered by the court, which is expressly prohibited by Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9).\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by deleting so much thereof as imposed a 5% surcharge on the $180 amount of restitution, and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court upheld a guilty plea by the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance, affirming the sentence of 6 to 12 years and restitution of $180. The defendant's claims regarding the waiver of the right to appeal and ineffective legal representation were found to be unpreserved and without merit, as he had previously expressed satisfaction with his attorney. However, the court modified the judgment by removing a 5% surcharge on the restitution amount, which was not permitted under the applicable law.<|eot_id|>"}

Ward, J.), rendered May 18, 2009, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony drug offender, to concurrent terms of two years for each of the three counts, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision for third-degree possession and drug sale, and two years of post-release supervision for fifth degree drug possession, unanimously affirmed.\nWe perceive no basis for reducing the sentence. However, defendant\u2019s purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid. At the plea proceeding, defendant agreed to plead guilty to the three charges contained in the indictment in exchange for the promised sentence. After defendant acknowledged the various trial rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, the court stated: \u201cYou also give up your right to appeal. Had you gone to trial in this case and been convicted, you could have appealed the sentence as well as the conviction, by pleading guilty you give up that right too. Understood?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d No mention was made of the appeal waiver at sentencing, and there was no written waiver executed.\nThe purported appeal waiver was invalid because defendant \u201cmay have erroneously believed that the right to appeal is automatically extinguished upon entry of a guilty plea\u201d (People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 893 [2006] [invalid waiver of appeal where court advised defendant that \u201cby pleading guilty you give up your right to appeal the conviction\u201d]). In this circumstance, and in the absence of a written waiver, there is no indication in the record that defendant understood the distinction between the right to appeal and the trial rights that are automatically forfeited as a result of a guilty plea (id.).\nWe previously have pointed out the problem with \u201cthe recurrent fusing, during allocution, of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal . . . with those rights waived by a guilty plea in cases where waiving the right to appeal is a condition of the plea bargain\u201d (People v Williams, 59 AD3d 339, 340 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 861 [2009]). Although \u201c[a] court need not engage in any particular litany\u201d to find a valid appeal waiver (People v Burney, 306 AD2d 173, 173 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 641 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), the better practice is for the court to secure a written waiver, along with a colloquy to ensure the defendant\u2019s understanding of its contents, dr, at a minimum, to specifically articulate that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the \u201cpanoply of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]). A separate allocution on the waiver of the right to appeal is critical because \u201c[b]y waiving the right to appeal in connection with a negotiated plea and sentence, a defendant agrees to end the proceedings entirely at the time of sentencing and to accept as reasonable the sentence imposed\u201d (id. at 255). Concur\u2014Andrias, J.P., Catterson, Renwick, Richter and Rom\u00e1n, JJ.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Supreme Court of New York County affirmed the conviction of the defendant for multiple drug offenses, sentencing him to two years for each count and subsequent post-release supervision. However, the court found the defendant's waiver of his right to appeal invalid, as there was no written waiver and the court's explanation conflated the right to appeal with rights forfeited by pleading guilty, potentially leading to confusion for the defendant. The ruling highlights the importance of clearly distinguishing between these rights during the plea process to ensure a valid appeal waiver.<|eot_id|>"}

At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea. Based upon some confusion as to whether the prosecutor had mentioned at the plea hearing the potential for persistent felony offender sentencing \u2014 which was not applicable in this case \u2014 and whether that statement may have improperly induced defendant\u2019s plea, County Court offered defendant a reduced sentence if he waived the right to appeal that issue. When defendant attempted to bargain for an even lower sentence, the court stated, \u201cIf [defendant] wants to withdraw his plea today, that\u2019s fine, it goes back on the trial calendar. We are through negotiating. It\u2019s the original offer or nothing.\u201d Defense counsel then informed the court that defendant would proceed with the five-year sentence. Counsel acknowledged defendant\u2019s status as a second felony offender and the court sentenced him to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant contends that County Court should have permitted him to withdraw his plea. The court did permit him to do so, but defendant instead chose to adhere to the original offer. Thus, he cannot now complain of the court\u2019s actions in that regard. Having abandoned his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant did not preserve the argument that his plea was involuntary (see People v Miller, 70 AD3d 1120, 1120-1121 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 890 [2010]; People v Watson, 62 AD3d 1032, 1033-1034 [2009]).\nDefendant was properly sentenced as a second felony offender. By not controverting the legitimacy of his prior conviction at sentencing or moving to vacate the judgment or sentence, he failed to preserve this argument (see People v Bynum, 68 AD3d 1348, 1350 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 798 [2010]). We decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction with respect to this aspect of the sentence because County Court and the prosecutor substantially complied with CPL 400.21 (see id.). Finally, County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence, which we do not find harsh or excessive considering that defendant has a serious criminal history and absconded after his arraignment on the present indictment.\nSpain, J.P, Lahtinen, Kavanagh and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDefendant appealed his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree after pleading guilty in exchange for a five-year prison sentence. He sought to withdraw his plea due to confusion over sentencing implications, but ultimately chose to accept the original offer, which precluded him from later arguing that the plea was involuntary. The court affirmed the conviction, stating that the sentence was appropriate given the defendant's criminal history and lack of challenges to his prior felony status.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant further waived his right to appeal from the conviction and sentence. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the promised prison term of four years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.\nAs an initial matter, defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant during the plea colloquy that, while he would ordinarily retain the right to appeal to a higher court after pleading guilty, he would be expected to give up that right so long as the sentence imposed was the one contemplated by the plea agreement. Defendant stated that he understood and agreed to waive his right to appeal. He then conferred with defense counsel and executed a detailed written waiver in open court that he acknowledged he understood. Therefore, \u201cin view of the whole colloquy, particularly given this defendant\u2019s background, including his extensive experience with the criminal justice system and multiple prior guilty pleas that resulted in terms of\u201d incarceration, we find that his appeal waiver was valid (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 342 [2015]; see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1332-1333 [2016]).\nDefendant next contends that the voluntariness of his guilty plea was impaired by the deficient performance of defense counsel but, while that challenge survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 214 [2016]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d at 1333). In any case, to the extent that his claim is not belied by the record, it involves \u201cmatters that are outside the record on appeal, such as what counsel advised him or investigated, [that are] more properly raised in a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL article 440\u201d (People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016]; see People v Hughes, 134 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 966 [2016]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver precludes him from arguing that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255; People v Renert, 143 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Rose and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment from the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance after he waived indictment and pled guilty. The defendant's waiver of his right to appeal was deemed valid, and although he claimed that his plea was involuntary due to ineffective assistance of counsel, this issue was unpreserved for review and should be raised in a separate motion. Additionally, the valid appeal waiver prevented him from contesting the severity of his sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

The defendant was indicated on March 5, 1975 in a two-count indictment charging the sale to which he pled guilty and possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.16). Both charges were classified as A-III felonies and the sentence therefor had to be a minimum of \"not less than one year nor more than eight years four months\u201d with a mandatory maximum of life (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00). The indictment charged the defendant with both the possession and sale as having occurred on January 17, 1975. On May 19, 1975 the defendant and his assigned counsel appeared in County Court and recited an agreement whereby the defendant would enter a plea of guilty to the first charge (selling) and the second count (possession) would be dismissed with the District Attorney to recommend a minimum of three years. The District Attorney confirmed the agreement and the court stated that it would follow the recommendation of three years. After the foregoing occurred in chambers, the proceedings were formalized in open court. The defendant was 23 years of age and he acknowledged that he understood the prior negotiations and agreements. The court asked him if he had sold heroin on January 17, 1975 to someone and he said \"yes\u201d and that he was saying yes because it was true. The court accepted the guilty plea and set August 13, 1975 for sentencing. The sole issue is whether or not the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On August 13, 1975 the defendant and his counsel advised the court that since pleading guilty the defendant had learned that many drug offenders had been given minimum sentences of only one year and, therefore, he felt the sentence agreed to was harsh. The defendant then recited that he did not sell the drugs but was only an agent, but he did admit to receiving consideration and giving the drugs to someone else. Upon the present record it appears that the sole reason the defendant wanted to withdraw his plea of guilty was because he had then come to believe the agreed sentence was harsh. He had not been misled by anyone and while he now thought he might dispute his guilt, no facts had changed. This is not a case where the agreed sentence is upon its face improvident and it is well established that the plea of guilty was voluntarily and knowingly entered. While the court at the time of accepting the plea did not elicit the underlying facts in great detail, subsequent events at the time defendant wanted to withdraw that plea made it apparent that he was intimately aware of all the facts relevant to guilt. Upon the present record, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P. J., Kane, Main, Herlihy and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a judgment from the County Court of Ulster County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance after he pleaded guilty. The defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming the agreed sentence was harsh based on new knowledge of minimal sentences given to other offenders, and argued he was merely an agent in the drug sale. However, the court upheld the guilty plea, determining it was entered voluntarily and knowingly, and denied the motion to withdraw, affirming the judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Prior to sentencing, defendant moved pro se to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and, in accordance with the plea agreement, sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of seven years followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claim that the SCI charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree was jurisdictionally defective survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver (see People v Brothers, 123 AD3d 1240, 1240 [2014]; People v Martinez, 106 AD3d 1379, 1379 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 957 [2013]). Here, the SCI erroneously denominated the crime charged as Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 (1), rather than Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 (12). Upon our review, however, we find that the record establishes that this was solely a typographical error as the facts alleged in the SCI made clear that the crime intended to be charged was Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 (12) (see People v Ashley, 89 AD3d 1283, 1285 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 955 [2012]; People v Sterling, 27 AD3d 950, 951-952 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 898 [2006]; People v Miller, 23 AD3d 699, 701 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 815 [2006]).\nDefendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, to the extent that it implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea, survives his appeal waiver and has been properly preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Ramey, 123 AD3d 1290, 1290 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 953 [2015]; People v Cavallaro, 123 AD3d 1221, 1223 [2014]). Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s specific claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are without support in the record. In this context, \u201ca defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Wares, 124 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [Apr. 21, 2015]; People v Ramey, 123 AD3d at 1290-1291). Here, the record discloses that defense counsel, among other things, secured a favorable plea deal for defendant and vociferously advocated against sentencing defendant as a second felony offender. Further, nothing in the record \u2014 from the commencement of his criminal case to the completion of his advantageous plea \u2014 casts doubt upon counsel\u2019s effectiveness. Defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel should have made various motions amounts to no more than second-guessing his counsel\u2019s legitimate legal strategy given that such motions would likely have been denied as without merit (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712-713 [1998]; People v Wares, 124 AD3d at 1081; People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1241, 1242-1243 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 944 [2013]). Accordingly, we find that defendant received meaningful representation.\nDefendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver \u2014 which he does not take issue with on appeal \u2014 precludes his challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution (see People v Sihounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2015]; People v Devault, 124 AD3d 1140, 1141 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 989 [Apr. 22, 2015]), his claim of prosecutorial misconduct (see People v Debberman, 113 AD3d 929, 929 [2014]) and his assertion that his agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Hall, 125 AD3d 1095, 1097 [2015]; People v Campo, 125 AD3d 1058, 1059 [2015]).\nEgan Jr., Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.

In exchange for defendant\u2019s guilty plea, he was promised a prison sentence of 7V2 years plus a period of postrelease supervision between 2V2 and 5 years. Following defendant\u2019s plea, County Court imposed sentence in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, setting the period of postrelease supervision at five years. Thereafter, counsel for defendant advised the court that the period of postrelease supervision authorized by law was actually between IV2 and 3 years and defendant moved to withdraw his plea. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea and resentenced him to a period of postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant argues that he was denied due process because he was not properly advised of the duration of the applicable period of postrelease supervision at the time he entered his guilty plea. We disagree. It is clear that \u201ca defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the post-release supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alterna tive courses of action\u201d (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; accord People v Hill, 9 NY3d 189, 191 [2007], cert denied 553 US 1048 [2008]; People v Rivera, 51 AD3d 1267, 1268 [2008]). Here, as required by People v Catu (supra), defendant was advised that he would be subjected to a period of postrelease supervision between 2V2 and 5 years. In fact, the legally authorized period of postrelease supervision was between IV2 and 3 years. Inasmuch as the duration of the postrelease supervision authorized by law and ultimately imposed fell within the range of which defendant was advised and to which he agreed at the time he entered his plea, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was a knowing, voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives, and County Court properly denied his motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Sheils, 288 AD2d 504, 505 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 733 [2002]; compare People v Miller, 62 AD3d 1047, 1048 [2009]).\nMercure, J.E, Malone Jr., McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Judgment affirmed. Although no medical examination was conducted to determine whether defendant was a narcotic addict, in our opinion, under the circumstances herein, strict and literal compliance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law was unnecessary. As indicated by the probation report which was before the court at the time of sentencing, defendant had a long history of drug-related arrests and convictions. He had previously been certified to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission pursuant to section 210 of the Mental Hygiene Law and had been released from that custody to aftercare only two weeks prior to his arrest on the instant charge. It is perfectly clear that there was a tacit understanding by all parties concerned during these proceedings that defendant was an addict. At the sentencing, defense counsel, in essence, requested that defendant be returned to the custody of the commission. The court, in so many words, responded that such a disposition had previously been unsuccessful and that the court therefore believed that a prison sentence was in order. Thus, the record amply demonstrates that defendant was addicted and that the sentencing court considered defendant\u2019s request for treatment (People v. Carter, 31 N Y 2d 964; cf. People v. Maranez, 31 N Y 2d 828). We have considered and rejected defendant\u2019s other contentions. Hopkins, Acting P.

The court also dismissed the defendant's other arguments.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court agreed to sentence him to no more than five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision, provided that he abide by the terms of his release to probation supervision pending sentencing. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to a prison term of five years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Although defendant\u2019s argument that his plea was not voluntary is not precluded by his waiver of appeal, the record does not reflect that defendant preserved this argument by making a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Whitfield, 94 AD3d 1238, 1238 [2012]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]).

He moved to suppress the evidence seized as well as certain statements he made to the police. Following a suppression hearing, County Court granted suppression of the statements, but not of the tangible physical evidence. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal.

Defendant also purports to appeal from an order of the same court dated February 2, 1981, which denied his motion for resentencing. Sentence affirmed. Appeal from the order dated February 2, 1981, dismissed. On November 13, 1979 defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, in violation of section 220.41 of the Penal Law. The incident to which he pleaded guilty involved the sale of cocaine and occurred on January 19, 1979. On January 18, 1980, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years to life. His subsequent application to have the court vacate his plea (CPL 440.10) or, in the alternative, to be resentenced (Penal Law, \u00a7 60.09) was denied. On appeal defendant only questions his sentence. Because the crime for which he was convicted occurred prior to September 1, 1979, the effective date of the 1979 amendments to this State\u2019s drug laws (L 1979, ch 410, \u00a7 29), the statutory range of defendant\u2019s sentence was from six years to life up to eight and a third to life (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 3, par [a], cl [ii]). He received the minimum permissible sentence, and therefore there is no excessive sentence issue for this court to decide. Defendant was eligible on his application for resentencing to receive a reduction of his sentence to as low a term as three years to life (Penal Law, \u00a7 60.09, subd b, par [ii]). The sentencing court\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying a motion for resentence under section 60.09 of the Penal Law is not subject to review (People v De Jesus, 54 NY2d 447; People v Stephens, 55 NY2d 778; Matter of Watson v Thorp, 89 AD2d 918).

He was sentenced to two five-year terms of imprisonment, to run consecutively to one another and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving on another conviction, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nDefendant argues that his sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record that includes a number of drug-related convictions. Notably, the convictions at issue stem from defendant\u2019s involvement in two incidents in which he sold cocaine to a confidential informant. Under the circumstances presented, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]; People v Burroughs, 64 AD3d 894, 898-899 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 794 [2009]).\nLikewise, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s two assertions raised in his supplemental pro se brief in support of his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Phillips, 96 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]).\nPeters, EJ., Mercure, Lahtinen and Stein, JJ., concur.

Under the plea agreement, defendant agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the People\u2019s recommendation of a three-year prison sentence and two years of post-release supervision with the understanding that County Court would consider him for placement in the Willard Drug Treatment Program or a shock incarceration program (see Correc tion Law art 26-A). At sentencing, County Court declined to place defendant in either the Willard program or a shock incarceration program and sentenced defendant to a prison term of three years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that his sentence is harsh and excessive because County Court rejected his request for placement in the Willard program or a shock incarceration program. The record reflects that County Court honored its commitment to consider defendant for placement in the Willard program and ultimately determined that it was not appropriate in this case given defendant\u2019s criminal history (see People v Patterson, 119 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1046 [2014]; People v Tollman, 92 AD3d 1082, 1083 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1065 [2013]; compare People v Muhammad, 132 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2015]). Inasmuch as County Court found that a drug treatment program would not be appropriate or warranted given defendant\u2019s criminal history, and defendant received the promised sentence, we find that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive (see People v Patterson, 119 AD3d at 1158-1159).\nPeters, P.J., Lynch, Rose, Rumsey and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Broome County convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea under a negotiated agreement for a three-year prison sentence and two years of post-release supervision.

In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review of the evidence pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).\nThe defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137 [1981]).\nThe sentence of imprisonment imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).

His counsel subsequently made an omnibus motion seeking, inter alia, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he was deprived of his statutory right to testify before the grand jury. County Court declined to dismiss the indictment on this basis. While incarcerated on the stated charges, defendant was involved in an altercation with two other inmates. He subsequently waived indictment, and was charged in a superior court information with two counts of assault in the second degree as a result of this incident.\nThereafter, defendant agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of assault in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, superior court information and other then pending weapons charges. The plea agreement included a waiver of defendant\u2019s right to appeal and the imposition of an indeterminate prison term of 5 to 10 years on the criminal sale charge and determinate three-year prison terms on each of the assault charges, all to run concurrently. Defendant proceeded to enter his plea and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement.\nDefense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant, asserting that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, in his pro se brief, argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and that County Court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. Defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal \u201cpreclude [s] review of his claimed denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel except insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea\u201d (People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982). Defendant\u2019s three contentions with regard to ineffective assistance of counsel are either unrelated to the voluntariness of his plea or are directly contradicted by the record which clearly establishes that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into this plea agreement. As for defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant\u2019s plea forecloses consideration of such claim (see People v Harris, 293 AD2d 818, lv denied 98 NY2d 676).\nIn short, our review of the record, the brief submitted by defense counsel and defendant\u2019s pro se brief confirms that there are no nonfrivolous issues that could be raised on appeal (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633).

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to four years in prison on the criminal sale charge, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, 2 to 4 years in prison on the criminal possession of a weapon charge and one year in jail on the drug paraphernalia charge, all of which were to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we note that because defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the voluntariness and facial sufficiency of his plea is unpreserved for our review (see People v Jenks, 69 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 841 [2010]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable here, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that tended to negate a material element of the crimes or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v White, 84 AD3d 1641, 1642 [2011]; People v Davis, 84 AD3d 1645, 1646 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 815 [2011]). As for defendant\u2019s claim that the recitation of the facts in connection with the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 [1]) did not establish that the semi-automatic handgun was operable, \u201cwe note that the exception to the preservation rule applies only where a recitation of facts casts significant doubt on a defendant\u2019s guilt and not, as here, where \u2018the sufficiency of the articulation of the element is challenged\u2019 \u201d (People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011], quoting People v Vonderchek, 245 AD2d 979, 980 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 945 [1998]). To the extent that any of defendant\u2019s arguments are preserved, we find that defendant\u2019s responses to County Court\u2019s inquiries sufficiently established both defendant\u2019s guilt and that he entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea.\nMercure, A.EJ., Peters, Malone Jr. and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

The defendant and one Mancini were charged with crimes as the result of a sale of heroin on February 7, 1976 to a \"friend\u201d of the defendant. The \"friend\u201d was acting as an informant because he had been arrested on February 6, 1976 by the police on various charges and he was offered immunity if he co-operated as to Manos. All three (defendant, Mancini and informant) were represented by one law firm in their criminal difficulties with Mancini and defendant being represented by the same lawyer in the early stages of the proceedings against them. The District Attorney, perceiving a conflict of interest between Mancini and the defendant, moved the trial court for an order directing either of the defendants to obtain independent counsel. A hearing was held at which the problem was fully explored upon the record with both defendants present. The trial court held an off the record discussion with the defendants and subsequently noted in its decision denying the motion: \"In spite of all this, the defendants continue to express a desire to be represented by defense counsel of their choice.\u201d Upon this appeal the defendant contends that the trial court should have ordered that the law firm (or attorney) withdraw from the case and that the continued representation by that law firm was a denial of the right of the defendant to effective counsel. County Court Judge Johnson rendered a written decision on August 24, 1976 denying the District Attorney\u2019s motion and that decision fully considered the constitutional rights (US Const., 6th Amdt., NY Const., art I, \u00a7 6) of the defendants) to the effective assistance of counsel. Further, the trial court fully considered and applied the rationale of People v Gomberg (38 NY2d 307) to the case before it. Subsequent to the hearing before Judge Johnson, a Huntley hearing was held and at that hearing it was established that the defendant\u2019s counsel not only represented Mancini, but had also represented the informant. In the brief on appeal this is alleged to be a surprise to defendant, and it is further alleged that defendant then sought to discharge his counsel but did not do so because he could not get back his retainer. However, the record is silent as to any \"surprise\u201d or any dissatisfaction with counsel by this defendant. It is worthy to note the sequence of events concerning the alleged representation of counsel. The charge against the informant was dismissed on July 26, 1976. Mancini pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, fourth degree, on May 31, 1977. However, he never testified in the Manos trial as a result of which the defendant\u2019s counsel argued that Mancini was the only seller, which argument apparently was not accepted by the jury. Any attempt to formulate a lack of effective counsel upon this record is pure speculation. The case meets all the requirements of People v Gomberg (supra) for a waiver by the defendant of any possible prejudice, which prejudice is not, in any event, apparent in this record. Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J. P., Kane, Main, Mikoll and Herlihy, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Tompkins County upheld the conviction of the defendant for third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term.

The court found no evidence of prejudice or ineffective assistance of counsel, affirming the judgment based on the defendants' waiver of any potential conflict and the lack of dissatisfaction with their representation.<|eot_id|>"}

His sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court agreed to impose a prison sentence of at least IV2 years followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision but no more than eight years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Moreover, it was agreed that this sentence was to run concurrently to a sentence imposed upon defendant\u2019s conviction on a separate charge pending in Albany County. The court adhered to the plea agreement and imposed a prison sentence of six years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to the previously specified sentence. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not preserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that defendant moved to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Musser, 106 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2013]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not triggered, as nothing said during the plea colloquy cast doubt upon defendant\u2019s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2012]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]).

On appeal, defendant contends that the consecutive prison sentences of lYa to 4 years and 3Ys to 10 years that he received upon his guilty pleas are harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was allowed to plead to a lesser offense in satisfaction of the superior court information and to one of two counts in satisfaction of the indictment. In addition, the sentences defendant received were less than the harshest possible. Further, defendant knew that he would receive the sentences ultimately imposed at the time of his plea in satisfaction of the indictment and declined to withdraw his guilty plea in satisfaction of the information at that time.

Judgment affirmed. No opinion. Cohalan, J. P., Hawkins and Suozzi, JJ., concur; Titone, J., dissents and votes to vacate the sentence and remand the case to Criminal Term for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: It is evident from a reading of the change of plea minutes that the sentence imposed on the defendant-appellant was not prompted by the exercise of sound discretion by the Criminal Term but, rather, was foisted upon that court by the prosecutor. When asked by the defendant why he could not receive a minimum sentence of three years in return for pleading guilty to a class A-III felony, the court answered: \"Because the District Attorney will not let you plead to an A-III felony to get three years.\u201d Later, the court reiterated that it was completely up to the District Attorney to say, \"Okay, let him go down to the A-III, providing he does a minimum of four years.\u201d Such statertients as to the power of the District Attorney\u2019s office to fix the term of sentence are totally at variance with our judicial system. Sentencing is a judicial responsibility and any attempt to undermine judicial control in the sentencing process must be rejected, as must any attempt to undermine the prosecutor\u2019s responsibility in recommending lesser pleas (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert den 419 US 1122). Accordingly, I dissent and vote to vacate the sentence and remand the case to the Criminal Term to allow defendant, if he wishes, to withdraw his plea and have the indictment reinstated. If the defendant at that time chooses to let the plea stand, then the Criminal Term should resentence defendant in accordance with what it believes to be proper within the statutory limits (see People v Ruggiero, 56 AD2d 569).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance, and the judgment was affirmed without opinion.

At trial, a jury found defendant guilty of five counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of 15 years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision.\nIn a separate matter, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment pertaining to an incident where he assaulted a man with a tire iron. After his trial on the drug charges, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted assault in the second degree in satisfaction of that indictment. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison, to be served concurrently with his sentence on the drug charges. Defendant appeals.\nThe jury\u2019s verdict on the 10 drug counts was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. Defendant argues that the evidence did not adequately establish his identity as the person involved in any of these transactions, or that he acted in concert with Pickett for three alleged sales. The undercover officer testified and identified defendant as the individual who personally sold him crack cocaine on two occasions. The officer also testified regarding numerous phone calls with defendant to arrange sales of cocaine. During the calls, the undercover officer or a confidential informant referred to defendant by his street name. After three of those calls, wherein defendant indicated that he was not in the area but \u201chis people\u201d were available or Pickett was holding his supply, the officer proceeded to the selected location and engaged in drug purchases from Pickett at the price and amount agreed upon with defendant (see Penal Law \u00a7 20.00). Audio recordings of the phone calls and the drug transactions themselves were entered into evidence and played for the jury. Two other police officers testified that they knew defendant\u2019s voice from previous contact and recognized the voice on the phone as defendant\u2019s. This evidence adequately established that defendant personally possessed and sold cocaine on two occasions, and that he acted in concert with Pickett to possess and sell cocaine on three other occasions (see People v Wilkins, 75 AD3d 847, 848 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 857 [2010]; People v Vargas, 72 AD3d 1114, 1117-1118 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]; People v Wilson, 71 AD3d 1333, 1334-1335 [2010]).\nCounty Court gave the jury a missing witness charge concerning the confidential informant. Defendant did not preserve any argument concerning the wording of that charge because he did not object to the charge that was given or request different language (see People v Hawkins, 110 AD3d 1242, 1244 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1041 [2013]; People v Burdick, 266 AD2d 711, 713 [1999]).\nDefendant asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his assault matter. To the extent that his claim relates to the voluntariness of his plea, the record does not indicate that he preserved the argument by making an appropriate postallocution motion; to the extent that his claim is unrelated to the voluntariness of the plea, he forfeited such claim by pleading guilty (see People v Lohnes, 112 AD3d 1148, 1150 [2013]).\nLahtinen, J.E, Rose, Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgments are affirmed.\nCounty Court later resentenced defendant to reflect the correct counts of the indictment, but the aggregate sentence remained the same.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Ulster County convicted the defendant of multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, leading to a 15-year prison sentence as a second felony offender, along with three years of postrelease supervision.

The defendant was advised that if he successfully completed the program, the current charges against him would be dismissed. Additionally, the defendant was warned that if he failed to complete the TASC program he would be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of three to six years. When the defendant appeared for sentencing, however, it was revealed that the TASC program to which he was sent would not permit him to take Prozac for his pre-existing psychiatric condition, and as a result, he was terminated from the program without completing it. The defendant thereupon asked that he be allowed to withdraw his plea on the ground that the drug treatment program was not suitable for him. The County Court rejected the defendant\u2019s application, and proceeded to sentence the defendant to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of three to six years.\nWhile the decision to allow a defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty generally rests in the sound discretion of the trial court (see, CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Brown, 251 AD2d 677), it is well settled that a plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert denied 419 US 1122). Under the circumstances herein, the defendant did not truly receive the benefit of his plea agreement. Thus, the County Court should have allowed the defendant to withdraw his plea. Mangano, P. J., Santucci, Krausman and Florio, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court reversed the judgment against the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, because he was not provided with the promised drug treatment program suitable for his psychiatric condition, leading to his termination from the program. The court ruled that since the plea was based on an unfulfilled promise, the defendant should have been allowed to withdraw his plea, and the case was remitted for further proceedings.<|eot_id|>"}

He subsequently pleaded guilty to the charges and waived his right to appeal. In exchange, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to prison terms of 2 to 4 years on the drug charge and 3 to 6 years on the weapons charge, to run consecutively, and was also ordered to pay restitution of $240 and a forfeiture of $270. The basis for sentencing defendant as a second felony offender was his conviction on September 4, 1991 of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, which he admitted. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea bargain and now appeals.\nDefendant challenges the legality of the sentence, arguing that his 1991 conviction did not provide a valid basis for his classification as a second felony offender because it occurred more than 10 years prior to the crimes at issue and there are no applicable tolling periods (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]; People v Stanley, 12 AD3d 467 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 891 [2005]). Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant\u2019s adjudication as a second felony offender resulted in a greater sentence than would have otherwise been imposed and, consequently, implicated his right to be sentenced according to law, it is not subject to the preservation requirement (see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52 [2000]; People v Stanley, supra at 467). Turning to the merits, it is clear from the predicate felony statement that the prior crime occurred outside the 10-year window and the People concede that there are no applicable tolling periods. In view of this, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing (see People v Wilsey, 301 AD2d 755, 756 [2003]). Given our disposition, we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining claim.\nCrew III, J.P., Carpinello, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

There was no discussion on the record between the court and the defendant concerning the waiver. Moreover, there is nothing in the record indicating an attempt by the court to ascertain on the record an acknowledgement from the defendant that she had, in fact signed the waiver or that, if she had, she was aware of its contents (see, People v DeSimone, supra). Accordingly, there is no assurance that the waiver was executed under constitutionally acceptable circumstances (see, People v DeSimone, supra).\nAs part of the negotiated plea, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment. The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally low sentence for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that her conviction should be reduced to a class A-II felony, and the People consent to that reduction. Under these circumstances, the conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced, in the interest of justice, to the lesser included offense of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.18) in order to better effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489).\nWe note in conclusion that the sentence imposed was not an excessive one for a class A-II felony (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Bracken, J.

Shortly thereafter, the Judge before whom the plea was taken recused himself. Upon his appearance before a different Judge, defendant availed himself of County Court\u2019s offer to withdraw the plea and restore the case to arraignment status despite the People\u2019s statement that the same recommended sentence would not be promised if defendant decided to plead guilty at a later date. Approximately five weeks later, he again pleaded guilty to the aforementioned two crimes with no sentencing recommendation by the People other than to seek second felony offender treatment rather than persistent felony offender treatment.\nAt the sentencing hearing, defendant unsuccessfully sought to withdraw the second plea on the basis of a \u201csecret agreement\u201d between defense counsel, the District Attorney and County Court whereby he was to receive lifetime probation in exchange for information regarding the Columbia County Drug Task Force. After the District Attorney and defense counsel denied the existence of any such agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to two concurrent inde terminate terms of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years. Subsequently, defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion seeking to vacate his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied and these appeals ensued.\nDefendant now argues that his posttrial motion was erroneously denied and his conviction should be reversed because counsel\u2019s advice to withdraw the first plea deprived him of effective assistance. We disagree. There is no record evidence that defense counsel advised defendant to withdraw his first plea. As defendant had not received a sentencing commitment from County Court regarding the first plea, the sentencing court retained discretion to impose an appropriate sentence notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement (see, People v Jarvis, 233 AD2d 632, lv denied 89 NY2d 943). Therefore, any advice to withdraw such plea and/or failure to ask County Court to accept the joint sentencing recommendation cannot be said to have deprived defendant of meaningful representation (see, People v Hobot, 84 NY2d 1021; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).\nNotably, during the plea allocution conducted before defendant entered his second plea, he affirmatively represented that he was satisfied with counsel. Before the entry of his second plea, counsel reminded defendant that he was prepared to \u201cgo ahead with the hearings and defend him\u201d. Upon further colloquy with County Court, defendant again represented that he did not want to go to trial.\nAt no time during the taking of the second plea, despite County Court\u2019s reminder of his sentencing exposure as a second felony offender and possibly as a persistent felony offender, did defendant indicate his expectation of a specific sentence in exchange therefor or even that he intended to cooperate with the District Attorney in the hope of a preference. Not until sentencing did defense counsel, who defendant now seeks to have branded as \u201cineffective\u201d, advise County Court of defendant\u2019s \u201cconversations\u201d with the District Attorney and his client\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d that he would receive lifetime probation in exchange for his cooperation. While admitting that there were discussions concerning cooperation, the District Attorney denied offering or recommending a sentence of lifetime probation. Defense counsel admitted that while the possibility of lifetime probation was raised in conversations between himself, the District Attorney and defendant, no promise was made. Hence, upon this record we find no support for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, supra; People v Aiken, 45 NY2d 394).\nFinally, under the circumstances presented we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed. Defendant, whose criminal history dates back to 1967, was sentenced within the statutory parameters as a second felony offender (see, People v Van Nordstrand, 238 AD2d 634; People v Dove, 233 AD2d 751, lv denied 89 NY2d 1011).\nMikoll, J.

The court found no evidence that the defense counsel advised him to withdraw his initial plea, and the defendant did not demonstrate expectations of a specific sentence in exchange for cooperation with the District Attorney.

The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification evidence.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by deleting the provision thereof which provides that the defendant\u2019s sentences for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree are to run consecutively to each other and substituting therefor a provision providing that the sentences are to run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, we find that the hearing court did not err in denying suppression of the in-court identifications of the defendant by four of the undercover police officers who had acted as purchasers during the three sales in question. At the Wade hearing, the officers testified that each had observed the defendant for a few minutes at close range, and under very good lighting conditions. The record, therefore, supports the hearing court\u2019s determination that an independent source existed to support the officers\u2019 in-court identifications of the defendant (see, United States v Wade, 388 US 218; see, e.g., People v Rowan, 199 AD2d 546, 547; People v Di Girolamo, 197 AD2d 531, 532-533; People v Brown, 191 AD2d 502; People v Ericsen, 186 AD2d 219; People v Benbow, 180 AD2d 805).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of a fair trial on the ground that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner is unpreserved for appellate review (see, People v Cruz, 200 AD2d 581). In any event, even assuming that the defendant presented a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor articulated racially neutral reasons for excusing the two black prospective jurors in question (see, Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79; People v Kern, 75 NY2d 638, cert denied 498 US 824; People v Hernandez, 75 NY2d 350, affd 500 US 352; People v Okehoffurum, 201 AD2d 508, 509).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish his guilt is also unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Udzinski, 146 AD2d 245). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nContrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, there is no evidence in the record which indicates that the defendant was punished for exercising his right to a jury trial (see, People v Canute, 190 AD2d 745; People v Sherrod, 181 AD2d 700; People v Brown, 157 AD2d 790, 792). Moreover, the sentencing court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing the defendant as a persistent felony offender (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.10 [2]; CPL 400.20 [1] [b]). We find, however, that under all of the relevant circumstances, including the fact that the sentence imposed exceeded that recommended by the prosecutor, the sentence was excessive to the extent indicated (see, e.g., People v Portillo, 190 AD2d 827).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se supplemental brief, are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Mangano, P. J., Thompson, Copertino and Hart, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of multiple counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, resulting in consecutive and concurrent sentences totaling 25 years to life imprisonment. The appellate court modified the judgment to have the sentences for the sale convictions run concurrently, but affirmed the conviction and the denial of the motion to suppress identification evidence, finding sufficient independent sources for the identifications. Other claims by the defendant regarding jury selection and sufficiency of evidence were deemed unpreserved or without merit, and the court found the sentencing appropriate despite being excessive in certain respects.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant waived indictment and, represented by assigned counsel, thereafter entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he would receive six months of interim proba tion and, if successfully completed, a sentence of five years of probation. During the plea colloquy, County Court affirmed that defendant was in good physical and mental health and that he had not been threatened or forced into entering the plea agreement. When asked whether he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s performance, defendant unequivocally stated that he had discussed the case at length with counsel and that he believed that counsel had done a \u201cgood job.\u201d The court thereafter accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to six months of interim probation, which included psychiatric treatment and participation with an assisted outpatient treatment order.\nWhen defendant appeared for sentencing in November 2011, after successfully completing his interim probation, defendant resisted his continued participation with the assisted outpatient treatment order and, for the first time, expressed dissatisfaction with counsel and requested a new attorney. County Court pointed out that counsel had performed well in negotiating probation rather than prison time for defendant, but informed defendant that he had the right to hire different counsel or represent himself, although he did not have a choice of assigned counsel. At counsel\u2019s request, suggesting that defendant \u201cmay not be himself today,\u201d the matter was adjourned.\nWTien the matter came on for sentencing in January 2012, defendant still expressed dissatisfaction with his representation, alleging for the first time that counsel had pressured him into taking the plea agreement while defendant was on medication. County Court reminded defendant that, at the time of the plea, he had stated that he had not been pressured into pleading guilty and the court had taken defendant at his word. Accordingly, the court imposed the agreed-upon five years of probation. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that County Court failed to make adequate inquiry before denying his request for substitute counsel. \u201cAn indigent criminal defendant must demonstrate \u2018good cause\u2019 for the appointment of substitute counsel, such as a conflict of interest or other irreconcilable conflict\u201d (People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d 1483, 1486 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 954 [2010], quoting People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]; see People v Linares, 2 NY3d 507, 510 [2004]). The trial court, in determining whether good cause exists, must consider the timing of the request, the effect on the progress of the case and whether present counsel is capable of providing meaningful assistance (see People v Linares, 2 NY3d at 510; People v Rolfe, 83 AD3d 1219, 1220 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 809 [2011]; People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d at 1486). Here, County Court made ample inquiry into defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with counsel and \u2014 having specifically queried defendant about the claimed deficiencies during the plea colloquy \u2014 found them to be unpersuasive. The court further noted that, considering defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, counsel had performed admirably in convincing both the court and the District Attorney that defendant would be better served by probation. We find no abuse of County Court\u2019s discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel (see People v Phillips, 96 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]; People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d at 1487; People v Breedlove, 61 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 913 [2009]).\nLastly, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the condition of his probation that requires him to take antipsychotic medication. Defendant agreed to voluntarily comply with all treatment recommendations as a requirement of his right to remain at liberty and this requirement is not punitive, but, rather, is reasonably related to his rehabilitation (see People v Hale, 93 NY2d 454, 462 [1999]; People v Franco, 69 AD3d 981, 983 [2010]; People v Brogan, 292 AD2d 781, 782 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 673 [2002]).\nPeters, EJ., Rose and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

The court upheld the conditions of probation, including mandatory antipsychotic medication, stating that these conditions were related to rehabilitation rather than punishment, and ultimately affirmed the original judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 3V2 to 7 years in prison for the weapon charge and one year in prison for the drug charge. Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that his sentence was harsh and excessive, a contention we cannot endorse. Notably, a sentence within permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of sentencing discretion exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872; People v Parson, 209 AD2d 882, 884, lv denied 84 NY2d 1014). Here, the sentence imposed was authorized and, given defendant\u2019s history and the details in the record, we find no reason to disturb the sentence in the interest of justice. Furthermore, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the fact that the sentence imposed after trial was longer than that offered to defendant in a proposed pretrial plea bargain agreement did not establish that the sentence was imposed in retaliation for exercising his right to trial (see, People v Morgan, 253 AD2d 946, lv denied 92 NY2d 950).\nCardona, P.

Defendant admitted to using marihuana and cocaine and failing to report, both in violation of the terms and conditions of her underlying probation. In exchange, she was to be sentenced on the underlying crimes to concurrent prison terms of 2V2 years, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. County Court revoked her probation and resentenced her accordingly. She now appeals from the judgment of conviction and the judgment of resentencing.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the term of imprisonment imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. We disagree. She admittedly continued engaging in drug use and failing to report while on probation, which resulted in its revocation. Moreover, the prison term imposed by County Court was within the parameters specifically agreed to by defendant. Inasmuch as there are no extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the resentence in the interest of justice, we decline to disturb it (see People v Harrison, 93 AD3d 995, 995 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 961 [2012]; People v Cherry, 263 AD2d 683, 683 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1016 [1999]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgments are affirmed.\nAlthough County Court briefly mentioned a waiver of appeal during resentencing, the record does not disclose that defendant actually waived her right to appeal with respect to the resentence, and the People concede that there was no colloquy between County Court and defendant in this regard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appeals from two judgments: one convicting her of drug-related crimes and sentencing her to probation, and another revoking that probation and imposing a prison sentence due to her violations. The court upheld the prison sentence, finding it appropriate given the defendant's continued drug use and failure to comply with probation terms, and determined there were no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction. Although there was a mention of a waiver of appeal, the record does not show that the defendant actually waived her right to appeal the resentencing.<|eot_id|>"}

After County Court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion, he pleaded guilty to the sale and possession counts in the indictment. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to concurrent terms of 7 to 14 years in prison, prompting this appeal.\nInitially, we note that defendant expressly waived his right to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion (see People v Booth, 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005]). Such waiver came in exchange for a sentencing promise by County Court (compare People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]), and otherwise appears to have been knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made (see generally People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-11 [1989]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as defendant failed to allege facts from which the court could conclude that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises subject to the warrant, we cannot conclude that County Court erred in denying his motion to suppress (see CPL 710.60; People v Wesley, 73 NY2d 351, 358-359 [1989]; People v Prodromidis, 276 AD2d 912, 912 [2000]; see also People v Geraghty, 212 AD2d 358 [1995], lv denied 85 NY2d 938 [1995]).\nAs to defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentence, we likewise note that such claim was encompassed within his knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of appeal (see People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 826 [1998]). Moreover, although this Court \u201cmay be divested of its unique interest-of-justice jurisdiction only by constitutional amendment\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; see People v Seaberg, supra at 9; People v Thompson, 60 NY2d 513, 520 [1983]), defendant, as a result of his valid appeal waiver, has relinquished his right to request that we exercise such authority (see People v Lopez, supra at 255).\nCrew III, Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

The court found that the defendant had knowingly waived his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion and the severity of his sentence as part of a plea agreement.

The defendant informed the trial court that assigned counsel had discussed with him the defenses of agency and entrapment and denied that counsel had ever advised him that she would not defend him at a trial of the crimes charged in the indictment if he declined the plea agreement and requested a trial. The record reveals that counsel provided the defendant with \"meaningful representation\u201d (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).\nFurthermore, the indeterminate sentence of from 3 to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment imposed upon the defendant\u2019s conviction of a class B felony was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion and we decline to substitute our discretion for that of the sentencing court. The sentence imposed was the result of a negotiated plea agreement which substantially reduced the defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure. Therefore, he cannot now complain that the sentence was unduly harsh or excessive (see, People v Perkins, 130 AD2d 521, lv denied 70 NY2d 716; People v Carbone, 117 AD2d 612, lv denied 67 NY2d 881; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered April 9, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of grand larceny 'in the fourth degree.\nOn the eve of trial, defendant disposed of a two-count indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to grand larceny in the fourth degree. The plea was entered with the understanding, stated on the record, that defendant would be sentenced as a second felony offender to the shortest permissible sentence, a prison term of IV2 to 3 years, with a recommendation of shock incarceration. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, primarily contending that his guilty plea was not properly entered and that CPL 410.91 is unconstitutional because it deprives him of equal protection of the law. We perceive no merit to defendant\u2019s contentions and accordingly affirm.\nFirst, defendant having failed to move to withdraw or to vacate his guilty plea, his contentions addressed to the voluntariness of his plea have not been preserved for our consideration (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, lv denied 88 NY2d 994; People v Perez, 228 AD2d 821, lv denied 88 NY2d 968; People v Trathen, 227 AD2d 73, lv denied 88 NY2d 996). In any event, the transcript of the plea allocution establishes that defendant\u2019s plea of guilty was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Contrary to defendant\u2019s current assertion, there is no requirement that a defendant personally recite the facts underlying his or her crime (see, People v Trathen, supra).\nSecond, to the extent that the issue survived defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and his qualified waiver of appeal, we are not persuaded that CPL 410.91, which creates the sentencing option of parole supervision for eligible individuals with a history of controlled substance dependence {see, CPL 410.91 [3]), denies defendant (who claims to have a problem with alcohol and nonnarcotic drugs) equal protection of the law. In view of the current nationwide drug crisis and the criminal conduct engendered thereby, it cannot be seriously argued that legislation targeting drug-dependent individuals and providing for intensive drug treatment in lieu of incarceration does not bear a reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective (see, People v Barnes, 62 NY2d 702).\nIn view of our determination that CPL 410.91 is not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, the remaining contention, addressed to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to adequately pursue that issue, need not be considered.\nWhite, Casey, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for grand larceny in the fourth degree after he entered a guilty plea as part of a plea bargain. The defendant's appeal, which challenged the voluntariness of his plea and the constitutionality of CPL 410.91, was rejected because he did not move to withdraw his plea and the record showed that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily. The court also found no merit in the argument that CPL 410.91 violated equal protection rights, affirming the legitimacy of legislative efforts to provide treatment options for individuals with substance dependence.<|eot_id|>"}

He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him, as agreed, to a prison term of four years to be followed by postrelease supervision of five years. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.\nDuring the plea colloquy, defendant stated that he understood the terms of the plea agreement, which included the requirement that he waive his right to appeal the conviction and sentence. He was then advised at sentencing with regard to the separate and distinct rights he was forfeiting by waiving his right to appeal, discussed the issue with counsel to his satisfaction, and both executed a written appeal waiver and professed his continuing willingness to do so if the agreed-upon sentence was imposed. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013]; People v Collins, 53 AD3d 932, 933 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 831 [2008]).\nDefendant\u2019s further contention that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is unpreserved, inasmuch as the record does not indicate that he moved to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gruber, 108 AD3d 877, 877 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 956 [2013]; People v Stroman, 107 AD3d 1023, 1025 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]). He further made no statements during the plea colloquy that called either his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea into question and, accordingly, this case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine (see id.).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining argument, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d at 1045).\nMcCarthy, J.R, Rose and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

In satisfaction of the first, he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced on March 11, 1999 to a prison term of 2V2 to 7V2 years. In satisfaction of the second indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees. On May 25, 1999, County Court imposed two concurrent prison sentences of 5 to 15 years to run consecutively with the earlier sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years.\nDefendant appeals from the second judgment of conviction arguing only that the sentences of 5 to 15 years were harsh and excessive and should, in any event, have been ordered to run concurrently with the earlier prison sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years. We disagree. Our review of the record herein convinces us that there are no extraordinary circumstances that would warrant modification of the sentences in the interest of justice (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, v denied 94 NY2d 917). At the time of his second arrest, defendant was out on bail awaiting trial of the first indictment. He was, nonetheless, found to be in possession of 63 baggies of crack cocaine. Given defendant\u2019s history of involvement in criminal activities, both as an adult and as a juvenile offender, together with his continued participation in drug-related crimes despite prior periods of incarceration, we see no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by County Court (see, People v Moore, 270 AD2d 715, 716, lv denied 95 NY2d 800; People v Cooper, 258 AD2d 815, 816, lv denied 93 NY2d 1016).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Peters, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered July 19, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nOn April 13, 1995, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with various drug-related crimes. At his arraignment on May 1, 1995, defendant entered a plea of not guilty and the People announced their, readiness to proceed to trial. Subsequently, at a conference before County Court on May 19, 1995, the matter was adjourned until June 15, 1995 to allow defendant time to consider a plea offer. Following defendant\u2019s rejection of the plea offer, the matter was adjourned again until late July 1995 to give defense counsel time to make certain pretrial motions. On August 10, 1995, County Court referred the matter to a Judicial Hearing Officer (hereinafter JHO) to conduct all pretrial hearings.\nFollowing various adjournments, the hearings were conducted on December 12, 1995. The JHO subsequently rendered a recommendation which was adopted by County Court in April 1996. Although trial was scheduled for April 24, 1996, it was adjourned at defense counsel\u2019s request until June 3, 1996. Before the matter proceeded, however, defense counsel made a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that defendant had been denied his right to a speedy trial. County Court denied the motion and rendered a judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree upon defendant\u2019s subsequent plea of guilty. In July 1996, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison. He now appeals his conviction.\nDefendant contends that the more than one-year delay between his indictment and sentencing deprived him of his statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial. Based upon the circumstances attending the delays in this case, we find defendant\u2019s claims unavailing. Notably, all of the delay occurred after the People announced their readiness to proceed to trial. \u201cPostreadiness delay may be chargeable to the People [only] where the causes of the delay directly implicate the People\u2019s ability to proceed with trial\u201d (People v Beckett, 215 AD2d 930, 932; see, People v Cortes, 80 NY2d 201, 210; People v Dushain, 239 AD2d 151, 153). Significantly, where the delay is attributable to adjournments requested by the defense (see, People v Dushain, supra, at 153), or occasioned by the necessity of pretrial proceedings (see, People v Reyes, 240 AD2d 165, 166, lv denied 90 NY2d 942) or the demands of the court calendar (see, People v Giordano, 56 NY2d 524, 525; People v Washington, 238 AD2d 263, lv denied 90 NY2d 944), the delay is not chargeable to the People.\nIn this case, the initial delay between the People\u2019s announcement of readiness and County Court\u2019s assignment of the JHO was due to adjournments requested to allow defendant to consider a plea offer and his counsel to file pretrial motions. The delay between the assignment of the JHO and County Court\u2019s adoption of the JHO\u2019s recommendation was a result of pretrial hearings. The adjournment of the April 1996 trial date was done at defense counsel\u2019s request. Absent proof in the record that the People were responsible for any significant amount of postreadiness delay in this case, we conclude that defendant was not deprived of his statutory right to a speedy trial. We further find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. Therefore, we decline to disturb the judgment of conviction.\nWhite, Peters, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court upheld the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance, rejecting his claims of being denied a speedy trial.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal, agreed to be sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison and signed a written \u201ccooperation\u201d agreement requiring him to assist law enforcement officials in certain investigations. At sentencing, defendant admitted that he did not fulfill the terms of the cooperation agreement and, as result, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of 4 to 12 years in prison. No direct appeal followed, but defendant eventually brought the present CPL article 440 motion seeking to vacate the judgment of conviction or, alternatively, to set aside the sentence. County Court denied the motion and this Court granted permission to appeal.\nInitially, defendant claims that the written cooperation agreement cannot be considered part of the plea agreement because it was not referred to by that name at the plea hearing and that, therefore, the enhancement of his sentence based upon his failure to comply with it was improper. Preliminarily, we note that defendant is not precluded by his waiver of appeal from raising this claim (see People v Terrell, 41 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2007]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]). Nevertheless, we find it to be without merit. Viewed in the context of the plea proceedings, the cooperation agreement was signed by defendant and his counsel the same day that defendant entered his guilty plea and it is clearly the agreement referenced at the plea hearing. The fact that it was not identified as such in open court is understandable given the sensitive nature of the subject matter and the need for confidentiality. Significantly, prior to defendant\u2019s entry of his guilty plea, County Court expressly stated that the execution of the written agreement was one of the terms of the plea agreement, and defendant communicated his understanding on the record. County Court informed defendant that if he failed to comply with the terms of the plea agreement, it would not be obligated to impose the promised sentence. In view of the foregoing, we find no error in County Court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence based upon defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement (see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 894-895 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]).\nDefendant further contends that he was deprived of the effec tive assistance of counsel. This claim, however, survives defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal only to the extent that it impacts the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Hall, 16 AD3d 848 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 887 [2005]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 586, 633 [2003]). Of the many assertions advanced by defendant in this regard, the only one that arguably does so is his claim that counsel erroneously failed to make a motion to withdraw the plea after the sentence was enhanced based upon a condition that was allegedly not a part of the plea agreement. However, inasmuch as this argument could have been raised on direct appeal, it is not the proper subject of a CPL 440.10 motion (see CPL 440.10 [2] [c]; People v Hickey, 277 AD2d 511, 511 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 964 [2000]). In any event, given defendant\u2019s admitted failure to comply with the cooperation agreement that was an integral part of the plea agreement, counsel\u2019s failure to make a motion to withdraw did not deprive defendant of meaningful representation (see People v Rose, 41 AD3d 1033, 1035 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 926 [2007]; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 798 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 980 [1999]).\nCardona, PJ., Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

He was represented by the Ulster County Public Defender\u2019s office and, two months later, an Assistant Public Defender executed a revocable waiver of defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights in order to engage in plea negotiations. In January 2013, an indictment was handed up that charged defendant with various offenses and the People declared readiness for trial.\nDefendant thereafter retained new counsel and rejected a plea offer to resolve the charges against him. Defendant also moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds which, based upon the speedy trial waiver executed by former counsel, was denied. The ensuing jury trial ended with defendant\u2019s conviction of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of eight years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s arguments on this appeal relate to alleged deficiencies in the performance of counsel. Former counsel embraced a valid strategy of waiving defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights in order to engage in plea negotiations, and \u201c[t]he People [were] entitled to rely on counsel\u2019s apparent authority to act on defendant\u2019s behalf and delay their case\u201d (People v Garcia, 33 AD3d 1050, 1052 [2006], lv denied 9 NY3d 844 [2007]; see People v McCorkle, 67 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2009]). Defendant notes that another Assistant Public Defender kept the possibility of a future speedy trial objection open by refusing to consent to adjournments sought and obtained by the People before Justice Court (compare CPL 30.30 [4] [b]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, there was nothing objectively inconsistent in executing a speedy trial waiver while also objecting to delays that, if they persisted beyond a potential revocation of that waiver, would be chargeable to the People. Defendant therefore failed to \u201cdemonstrate the absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel\u2019s failure\u201d as is required to \u201covercome the strong presumption that defense counsel rendered effective assistance\u201d (People v Ambers, 26 NY3d 313, 317 [2015] [internal quotations marks and citations omitted]; see People v Bond, 110 AD3d 1366, 1367 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1197 [2014]).\nDefendant further asserts that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him of the advantages and disadvantages of accepting a proposed plea agreement as opposed to proceeding to trial. The record shows that defendant was made aware of the offer by former counsel, that an adjournment was granted so that defense counsel could, among other things, consider it, and that defendant then rejected it. Inasmuch as there is no record proof as to what defendant was (or was not) advised prior to rejecting the plea offer, his contention must be raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1564 [2017]; People v Santiago, 118 AD3d 1032, 1032-1033 [2014]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Lynch, Clark and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance following a traffic stop where drugs were found in his vehicle. The defendant's arguments focus on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly regarding a speedy trial waiver and advice on a plea agreement, but the court found that the counsel's actions were strategically sound and that the defendant failed to demonstrate any deficiencies warranting reversal. Consequently, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant raises four issues on this appeal, viz., (1) the court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained by eavesdropping warrants and a search warrant, (2) the court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial evidence was not legally sufficient to establish the offense charged, (3) the court erred in admitting into evidence the People\u2019s Exhibits Nos. 15 and 21-A,' and (4) the sentence imposed was excessive and unduly harsh. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s claims. The eavesdropping warrants, the search warrant and the supporting papers are exactly the same as this court considered in People v Penna (53 AD2d 941). We hold that the facts alleged in support of the eavesdropping warrants and the search warrant were sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance thereof for the reasons set forth in People v Penna (supra). The record contains sufficient evidence to establish commission of the offense charged. Defendant points to his testimony that he did not know any marijuana was on the premises and that he had no marijuana in his possession or under his control. Defendant\u2019s testimony was in sharp conflict with the testimony of Investigators Crowley and Padula. The jury resolved the conflict in the testimony in favor of the People. It is within the province of the jury to determine which of the conflicting testimony they believe (People v White, 2 NY2d 220). The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence transcripts of taped telephone conversation, represented by People\u2019s Exhibits Nos. 15 and 21-A. The record discloses that the transcripts were admitted for the limited purpose of aiding the jury in understanding the tapes when played. The jury was not allowed to use the transcripts in its deliberations. The trial court\u2019s procedure is supported by precedent (People v Feld, 305 NY 322). Defendant was convicted of a class C felony subjecting him to a maximum sentence of 15 years (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 2, par [c]). We are unable to conclude, as urged by defendant that under the circumstances the sentence of imprison ment for a term not to exceed five years was unduly harsh and excessive. The matter of sentencing rests within the sound discretion and judgment of the sentencing court and should be disturbed only under extraordinary circumstances (People v Perry, 52 AD2d 963). We find no abuse of discretion in imposing sentence herein. Judgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Larkin, Herlihy and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the Chemung County Court's judgment, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance and sentenced him to up to five years in prison, was denied on all four raised issues. The court upheld the validity of the eavesdropping and search warrants, found sufficient evidence to support the conviction despite conflicting testimonies, and ruled that the admission of certain exhibits was proper. The sentencing was deemed appropriate and within the court's discretion, leading to an affirmation of the judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal and, after his motion to withdraw the plea was denied, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon indeterminate prison term of 6 to 16 years. Defendant appeals challenging, inter alia, the legality of the sentence.\nPursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (4) (b), \u201cthe minimum period of imprisonment under an indeterminate sentence for a second felony offender must be fixed by the court at one-half of the maximum term imposed and must be specified in the sentence.\u201d When County Court established defendant\u2019s status as a second felony offender, the enhanced minimum term was mandatory (see, People v Palmer, 176 AD2d 995, 997, lv denied 79 NY2d 951). Thus, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence imposed by the court clearly did not comply with the mandate of Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (4) (b).\nRelying on People v Martin (278 AD2d 743), the People argue that the appropriate remedy is to reduce the maximum term of defendant\u2019s sentence to 12 years. In the Martin case, this Court acknowledged that \u201cwhere the agreed-upon sentence is illegal n because it is greater than the legal maximum, the imposition of a legal sentence does not necessarily deprive a defendant of the benefit of the plea bargain. Rather, in such instances, the courts have seen fit to reduce the sentence without affording the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea\u201d (id., at 744). In this case, however, the sentence is not greater than the legal maximum. The 16-year maximum term is legally permissible for a class B felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]) and the 6-year minimum term does not exceed the statutorily mandated one half of the maximum. In any event, contrary to the remedy proposed by the People, the statutory sentencing scheme for second felony offenders does not contemplate the use of the minimum term to calculate a permissible maximum term. Rather, the sentencing court must first fix a permissible maximum term and then impose a minimum term of one half of the maximum.\nWhere, as here, \u201cthe plea bargain includes a sentence which is illegal because the minimum imposed is less than that required by law, this Court has held that the proper remedy is to vacate the sentence and afford the defendant, having been denied the benefit of the bargain, the opportunity to withdraw the plea\u201d (People v Martin, supra, at 744; see, People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941). Inasmuch as defendant moved prior to sentencing to withdraw his plea on this ground and argues on appeal that County Court erred in denying the motion, we are of the view that the appropriate remedy in this case is to vacate both the plea and the sentence, and to restore the case to the preplea stage.\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, defendant\u2019s plea and sentence vacated, indictment restored and matter remitted to the County Court of Ulster County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reversed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance, finding that the imposed sentence was illegal due to the minimum term being less than required by law.

In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to three felony counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and a misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender to 6 to 12 years in prison for the felony convictions and a one-year jail term for the misdemeanor conviction, to run concurrently. This appeal ensued.\nDefendant contends that because her competency was at issue, County Court erred in accepting her guilty plea without first following the procedures set forth in CPL 730.20. We disagree. It is well settled that \u201cwhenever a court has a \u2018reasonable ground for believing that a defendant is in such state of idiocy, imbecility or insanity that he is incapable of understanding the charge, indictment or proceedings or of making his defense, it is the duty of the court to direct him to be examined in these respects\u2019 \u201d (People v Tortorici, 92 NY2d 757, 765, cert denied 528 US 834, quoting People v Smyth, 3 NY2d 184, 187). A defendant, however, is presumed competent (see, People v Morgan, 87 NY2d 878, 880; People v Maldonado, 273 AD2d 537, 540, lv denied 95 NY2d 867) and \u201cis not entitled, as a matter of right, to have the question of his capacity to stand trial passed upon * * *~if the court is satisfied from the available information that there is no proper basis for questioning the defendant\u2019s sanity\u201d (People v Armlin, 37 NY2d 167, 171; see, People v Horan, 290 AD2d 880, 882).\nAfter defendant indicated in proceedings before County Court in January 2001 that she had been taking medication and was under the care of mental health professionals for manic depression the previous summer, the court adjourned the matter to give defense counsel an opportunity to obtain further information. When proceedings resumed, defense counsel provided the court with correspondence from two social workers who indicated, respectively, that no mental status abnormalities were present and that defendant was rational and coherent. Under these circumstances, we conclude that County\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in failing to go further and have defendant examined pursuant to CPL 730.20 (1) (see, People v Maldonado, supra at 540-541). Indeed, during the course of the plea colloquy, defendant responded capably to the questions put to her by County Court, evidenced no indication of mental impairment (see, People v Young, 257 AD2d 764, lv denied 93 NY2d 931) and proceeded to enter a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty. Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which to disturb the underlying plea. Likewise, given defendant\u2019s criminal history and use of a 12-year-old child as a drug courier, we find that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive (see, People v Smith, 288 AD2d 693, lv denied 97 NY2d 761; People v Spann, 287 AD2d 880, 881).\nPeters, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance and one count of endangering the welfare of a child, following her guilty plea. The defendant argued that her competency was in question and that the court should have conducted a mental evaluation before accepting her plea; however, the court found that there was no reasonable basis to doubt her competency based on evidence provided by mental health professionals. The sentence of 6 to 12 years in prison, to run concurrently with a one-year jail term for the misdemeanor, was deemed appropriate given the circumstances of the case.<|eot_id|>"}

Two of defendant\u2019s brothers were also charged with drug-related crimes and the District Attorney made a collective plea offer. Pursuant to the offer, de fendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 10 years to life in prison. At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, claiming that he was innocent and was coerced into accepting the plea offer by virtue of its collective nature. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accordance with the agreement, prompting this appeal.\n\u201cThe decision whether to permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the discretion of the trial court, \u2018and only in rare instances will a hearing be granted\u2019 \u201d (People v Bolden, 289 AD2d 607, 608 [2001], lv denied 98 NY2d 649 [2002] , quoting People v Yell, 250 AD2d 869, 869 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 863 [1998]; see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Totman, 269 AD2d 617, 618 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 839 [2000]). \u201cGenerally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement\u201d (People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940 [1998] [citation omitted]; see People v McDonnell, 302 AD2d 619, 620 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 540 [2003]). Here, defendant did not protest his innocence during the plea allocution. To the contrary, he admitted that he possessed both the gun and cocaine weighing in excess of four ounces and also that he sold a quantity of cocaine (see People v Davis, supra at 940). In addition, he informed County Court that he understood he did not have to plead guilty and was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice regarding the plea. At no point did he state that he felt pressured into accepting the plea due to the collective nature of the plea offer. In sum, there is nothing in the record to indicate that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing (see People v Robinson, 301 AD2d 745, 747 [2003] , lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]; People v Davis, supra).\nMercure, Carpinello, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

We must now address whether the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive. The record discloses that defendant received a sentence of five years in prison upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and three years in prison upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, to run concurrently, and to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This was significantly less than the maximum term that could have been imposed and, notably, the plea agreement did not include a commitment by the court with respect to sentencing. In view of this, and given the quantity of heroin confiscated by the police, we find no abuse of discretion nor the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Rivera, 24 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2005]).\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Kane, Malone Jr. and Garry, JJ., concur.

He pleaded guilty to that crime, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to two years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Thereafter, as defendant\u2019s conviction was related to a controlled substance, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commenced deportation proceedings against him (see 8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). Defendant subsequently moved to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10, claiming that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because his attorney had assured him that pleading guilty would not expose him to deportation. After concluding that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance challenge did not impact the voluntariness of his plea and was thus precluded by the waiver of his right to appeal, County Court denied the motion without a hearing. With permission from this Court, defendant now appeals.\nWe reverse. Inasmuch as defendant asserts that he would not have pleaded guilty but for counsel\u2019s representation that, doing so would not subject him to deportation, defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea and survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]), particularly in view of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Padilla v Kentucky (559 US \u2014, 130 S Ct 1473 [2010]). Moreover, where a defendant can demonstrate prejudice \u2014 that he or she would not have entered the plea and would have insisted on going to trial absent counsel\u2019s misadvice \u2014 such a claim may form the basis for vacating a plea (see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 114-115 [2003]). Here, the affidavit accompanying defendant\u2019s motion indicates that he initially rejected the People\u2019s plea offer, accepting it only after allegedly being assured by counsel several times that pleading guilty would not result in his deportation (cf. id. at 115). Notably, an affidavit submitted by defendant\u2019s girlfriend supports his contention, suggesting that defendant repeatedly expressed reservations about pleading guilty if such a plea might lead him to being deported. According to her, she was present on at least four occasions when defense counsel stated that defendant would not be exposed to deportation proceedings due to his guilty plea. Under such circumstances, County Court should have conducted a hearing prior to deciding defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion (see People v Marshall, 66 AD3d at 1116; People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d 437, 438-440 [2004]; compare People v Argueta, 46 AD3d 46, 51 [2007], lv dismissed 10 NY3d 761 [2008]).\nPeters, J.P., Lahtinen, Malone Jr. and Garry, JJ., concur.

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to three years in prison, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claim that County Court failed to advise him that he could controvert the allegations contained in the prior felony information and that he was, therefore, improperly sentenced as a second felony offender survives his unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal, but is unpreserved due to his failure to object at sentencing despite having the opportunity to do so (see People v Berry, 152 AD3d 1080, 1080-1081, 1081 n [2017]; People v Woods, 147 AD3d 1156, 1157 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1089 [2017]; cf.

He also pleaded guilty to two other unrelated felonies, assault in the second degree, a class D felony, and intimidating a witness in the third degree, a class E felony. On April 27, 1989, as part of the package plea bargain which included the sentence on the drug sale charge, defendant received concurrent sentences of 3 to 6 years on the assault charge and lVi to 3 years on the witness intimidation charge.\nOn this appeal, defendant has challenged the sentence for the criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction. Defendant contends that County Court failed to inquire if he wished to controvert the allegations as provided in CPL 400.21. At sentencing, the court and defendant were provided a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 charging that he had been previously convicted of attempted robbery in the first degree on March 26, 1985 within this State, which constituted a predicate felony. When asked if this was true, defendant readily admitted the same. Immediately thereafter, and on several subsequent instances, defendant and his counsel were both given the opportunity to say anything they wanted. No objection was registered by either defendant or his counsel. There was some discussion about withdrawal of the plea on the assault and intimidation charges, but defendant ultimately decided to plead guilty to these charges as well. On this record, there has been substantial compliance with the statute which provides that the sentencing court must inquire if the defendant controverts the prior felony (see, People v Santana, 104 AD2d 677, 678). In addition, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the compliance with CPL 400.21 has been substantial and that the challenge should be rejected (see, People v Kluck, 156 AD2d 830).\nFinally, defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was presented with a criminal record which included two other serious crimes to which defendant had pleaded guilty and for which he was to receive concurrent sentences. The grounds urged for leniency or mitigation fail to demonstrate any positive or exceptional circumstances. Moreover, prior attempts at rehabilitation have been unavailing. Accordingly, there has been no showing of abuse of County Court\u2019s discretion in sentencing (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Weiss and Harvey, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Rensselaer County convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced him to 6 to 12 years in prison as a predicate felon, along with concurrent sentences for two other felonies. On appeal, the defendant argued that the court did not properly inquire whether he wished to contest prior felony allegations; however, the court found substantial compliance with the relevant statute. The appeal was rejected, as the court determined that the sentence was not harsh or excessive given the defendant's criminal history and lack of successful rehabilitation efforts. The judgment was affirmed.<|eot_id|>"}

In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt (see, People v Reed, 256 AD2d 365). Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nHowever, the sentence was excessive to the extent indicated,\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his supplemental pro se brief, are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit.

While this issue would survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Murphy, 114 AD3d 704, 705 [2014]; People v Joseph, 103 AD3d 665 [2013]; People v Ballinger, 12 AD3d 686, 687 [2004]), it is nonetheless unpreserved for appellate review, since the defendant did not move to vacate her plea prior to the imposition of sentence or otherwise raise the issue in the County Court (see People v Sirico, 135 AD3d 19, 22 [2015]; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d 1081 [2015]; People v Bennett, 122 AD3d 871, 872 [2014]). In any event, since the County Court expressly advised the defendant of the Boykin rights and other constitutional rights that she was waiving by pleading guilty, and the record affirmatively demonstrates the defendant\u2019s understanding and waiver of these constitutional rights, we find that the plea of guilty was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 19-20 [1983]; People v Sirico, 135 AD3d at 22; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d at 1082; People v Jackson, 114 AD3d 807, 807-808 [2014]).\nWhile a defendant who has validly waived the right to appeal cannot invoke this Court\u2019s interest of justice jurisdiction to obtain a reduced sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]), here, the Court is not precluded from exercising its interest of justice jurisdiction, since the defendant\u2019s purported waiver of her right to appeal was invalid. The record does not demonstrate that the defendant understood the distinction between the right to appeal and other trial rights forfeited incident to her plea of guilty (see People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 893 [2006]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 257; People v Gordon, 127 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2015]; People v Cantarero, 123 AD3d 841, 841 [2014]; People v Ayala, 112 AD3d 646 [2013]). Furthermore, although the defendant executed a written appeal waiver form, there is no indication on the record that the County Court obtained an acknowledgment from the defendant that she had, in fact, signed the waiver or, if she had, she was aware of its contents or discussed it with defense counsel (see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; People v Gordon, 127 AD3d at 1231; People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133, 145 [2014]). Accordingly, despite the defendant\u2019s execution of a written waiver of her right to appeal, she did not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently waive her right to appeal (see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d at 510; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d at 283).\nThe sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated herein (see People v Gordon, 132 AD3d 904 [2015]; People v Velasquez, 181 AD2d 751 [1992]; People v Irby, 95 AD2d 839 [1983]; People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).\nHall, J.P., Roman, LaSalle and Barros, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance, resulting in a seven-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine.

The court found the defendant's plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily, despite her claims of not being properly informed about her rights; however, it ruled her waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, allowing for the sentence modification in the interest of justice.<|eot_id|>"}

In accordance with the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to six years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nDefense counsel was assigned to represent defendant on appeal and she seeks to be relieved of her assignment on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant disagrees, claiming in his pro se submission that the search of his vehicle was illegal and that his retained counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue in County Court deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. However, the record belies such claim and clearly indicates that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal four days after County Court denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle that he was driving. Accordingly, defendant may not now challenge the legality of the search (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833; People v Collier, 232 AD2d 878, 878, lv denied 89 NY2d 863) nor the effectiveness of his counsel (see People v McGuffie, 294 AD2d 617, 618, lv denied 98 NY2d 699; People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643, lv denied 98 NY2d 681). Because we agree that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal, the judgment is affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633).\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

In a negotiated plea, defendant was permitted to plead guilty to one count of the indictment. He was thereafter sentenced to 1 Vs to 4 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant contends that the sentence is excessive and an abuse of discretion because County Court imposed a harsher sentence on defendant than on the codefendants. An appellate court will not disturb a negotiated plea if the plea is just and proper in relation to the facts of the case. Discretion in the imposition of sentence rests with the trial court and should not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion (People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).\nThe sentence imposed here is within the statutory limits and is not objectionable on those grounds. However, we conclude that, in view of the circumstances of this case, County Court abused its discretion as evidenced by the disparity of the sentence imposed on this defendant. While we do not minimize the gravity of the crime, the interest of justice dictates a modification of defendant\u2019s sentence in this case to that imposed on the other two codefendants. This defendant\u2019s guilt was commensurate with that of his codefendants, defendant\u2019s prior record did not call for harsher treatment, and, finally, the prosecutor, in recommending to County Court a sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 probation, indicated that one of the codefendants was more culpable since he masterminded the crime. Accordingly, we modify defendant\u2019s sentence by reducing his prison term to time already served and imposing a term of probation (see, Penal Law \u00a7 65.00 [3] [a] [i]), the conditions of which shall be fixed by County Court.\nJudgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed in accordance with the terms of this decision; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith; and, as so modified, affirmed. Mahoney, P. J, Kane, Weiss, Mikoll and Yesawich, Jr, JJ, concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court modified the defendant's sentence for criminal possession of a controlled substance, originally 1 \u00bd to 4 years, determining that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a harsher sentence compared to the codefendants despite similar culpability. The modified sentence was changed to time served with probation, in alignment with the sentences given to the codefendants, reflecting the interest of justice. The case was remitted for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<|eot_id|>"}

In a separate indictment, defendant was charged with one count of failing to register as a sex offender as a class E felony based upon his previous conviction for failure to register as a sex offender (see Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-f, 168-t). Pursuant to a combined negotiated disposition, defendant pleaded guilty to all counts in both indictments. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, asserting, among other things, that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to an aggregate prison term of six years on the drug convictions, a concurrent sentence of one year on the sex offender registration conviction, and three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals from that part of the judgment pertaining to the drug-related convictions and we affirm.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that his appeal waiver was invalid. An appeal waiver is effective as long as the record confirms that it was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). This standard is met if the record reveals that \u201cdefendant [had] a full appreciation of the consequences of such waiver\u201d (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and that defendant understood \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Here, the record of the plea proceedings reflects that County Court clearly stated the terms of the plea agreement covering both indictments, explained both the trial and appeal rights that defendant was waiving and specifically confirmed that defendant\u2019s right to appeal was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from those rights he was waiving as part of the plea and sentence agreement and that it meant he would \u201cbe giving up [his] right to appeal both the pleas and the sentences to a higher court.\u201d Defendant unequivocally acknowledged that he had conferred with his attorney, signed the written appeal waiver and indicated that he understood the consequences of his plea and waiver. In our view, the record amply demonstrates that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264; People v Turner, 126 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2015]; People v Sibounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1059 [2015]).\nDefendant also contends that his guilty plea was involuntary. Generally, such a claim survives an appeal waiver and may be considered where, as here, it is preserved by a motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1449 [2014]). On this appeal, although defendant concedes that his pro se motion did not include a request for the appointment of substitute counsel, he claims that County Court was obligated to consider appointing substitute counsel because the gravamen of his motion was that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel before he agreed to plead guilty.\nWe are unable to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in not sua sponte appointing counsel based on defendant\u2019s contentions of ineffective assistance. \u201cIt is well settled that a defendant has a right to the effective assistance of counsel on his or her motion to withdraw a guilty plea\u201d (People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 966 [2013] [citations omitted]). Generally, when assessing whether substitute counsel should be appointed, a court should determine whether good cause exists based on \u201cthe timing of the defendant\u2019s request, its effect on the progress of the case and whether present counsel will likely provide the defendant with meaningful assistance\u201d (People v Linares, 2 NY3d 507, 510 [2004]). Relevant here, \u201c[w]hen certain actions or inaction on the part of defense counsel is challenged on the motion, it may ... be necessary for defense counsel . . . when asked to by the court ... to explain his [or her] performance with respect to the plea\u201d (People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d at 967). If counsel takes a position that is adverse to his or her client, then a conflict of interest arises and the defendant must be assigned new counsel (see id.; People v McCray, 106 AD3d 1374, 1375 [2013]). Where, as here, defense counsel takes no position on a motion to vacate a plea, no conflict of interest arises (see People v Hutchinson, 57 AD3d 1013, 1015 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 817 [2009]). Thus, County Court was not obligated to assign substitute counsel before deciding the motion (see People v Sylvan, 108 AD3d 869, 871 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1091 [2014]; People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d 861, 862-863 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1076 [2013]).\nAs to the merits of the motion to vacate the plea, our review of the plea colloquy confirms that defendant understood the terms of the plea agreement and that his acceptance of such terms was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; People v Howard, 119 AD3d 1090, 1090-1091 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 961 [2014]). We further find that nothing in the record casts doubt upon counsel\u2019s effectiveness, and counsel negotiated a favorable plea deal (see People v Jackson, 128 AD3d 1279, 1280 [2015]). Defendant\u2019s remaining claims, including his claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, are precluded by the valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Jackson, 128 AD3d at 1280).\nMcCarthy, J.R, Egan Jr. and Devine, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nIn a separate appeal, defendant challenges his plea to the charge of failing to register as a sex offender (People v Tyler, 130 AD3d 1385 [2015] [appeal No. 106736, decided herewith]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County, which convicted the defendant of multiple drug-related offenses and failing to register as a sex offender. The defendant's plea was found to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and his claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel and the validity of his appeal waiver were rejected. Additionally, the court ruled that the sentencing was appropriate and not harsh or excessive, upholding the plea agreement made by the defendant.<|eot_id|>"}

He acknowledges that prior to sentencing the court had before it a presentence report prepared by the Ulster County Department of Probation and a supplemental presentence report prepared by the Greene County Department of Probation with respect to two separate convictions arising from the same investigation which led to the instant conviction. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that a separate report specifically relating to the Orange County indictment was required.\nAssuming, in the first instance, that a separate report as to the present incident was required, we find upon this record that any violation of CPL 390.20 was waived. The sentence was the result of a negotiated plea and the defense counsel specifically agreed, on the defendant\u2019s behalf, to proceed to sentence on the basis of the Ulster County and Greene County presentence reports which were prepared shortly before the instant sentence was imposed (see, People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93, 98; People v Dowdell, 72 AD2d 622; People ex rel. Seaman v Warden, 53 AD2d 848; cf., People v Andujar, 110 AD2d 606).\nIn any event, we are of the opinion that the court was sufficiently apprised of the information relevant to sentencing as to be capable of imposing the appropriate and agreed-upon term of imprisonment (see generally, People v Sanchez, 143 AD2d 377; People v Goon, 124 AD2d 347; cf., People v Jackson, supra). The Ulster County and Greene County reports provided a detailed account of the defendant\u2019s family, employment, educational and criminal background and history and the basis for the ongoing narcotics investigation of the defendant by the New York State Police.\nNor do we find the sentence imposed to be excessive. The sentence was the result of a negotiated plea bargain which substantially reduced the defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure. The defendant was sentenced as promised and, thus, he will not now be heard to complain that his sentence was excessive. Mollen, P.

In exchange, he was sentenced to a prison term of 8V3 years to life. As part of the agreement, defendant entered his plea prior to filing pretrial motions. On this appeal, defendant contends that his inability to file pretrial motions deprived him of the right to seek judicial inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, a process which might have revealed that there was an insufficient quantity of drugs in his possession at the time of his arrest to substantiate the most serious charge in the indictment, i.e., that of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Had this proven to be the case, defendant argues, he would not have been induced to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.\nThis contention lacks merit. A defendant who accepts a plea bargain surrenders the right to challenge the factual basis for the plea and, in addition, is precluded from thereafter challenging the merits of charges that were dismissed in the course of plea bargain negotiations (see, People v Morelli, 228 AD2d 818, lv denied 88 NY2d 990; see also, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97, 108).\nWe also reject the argument that defendant\u2019s sentence of 8V3 years to life was harsh and excessive. The record discloses that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea and in exchange therefor three other charges against him were dismissed. Defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime of which he was convicted is uncontested. We conclude that the sentence imposed by County Court cannot be characterized as an abuse of discretion, nor are there any extraordinary circumstances present that would lead us to disturb it (see, People v Thompson, 233 AD2d 615; People v Smith, 210 AD2d 533, lv denied 84 NY2d 1039).\nCardona, P.

The granting of youthful offender treatment rests entirely with the court\u2019s discretion and depends upon the facts of each individual case (CPL 720.20 [1]; see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 333-335, affd 67 NY2d 625; see also, People v Hayes, 115 AD2d 910). Our review of the record discloses no abuse of judicial discretion here.\nDefendant\u2019s conviction arose out of his sale of heroin to a college student who subsequently died of a drug overdose. Although defendant, who was then 17 years old, had no prior criminal convictions, he was a known drug dealer in the community. As the sentencing court accurately observed, defendant\u2019s sale of drugs on the date in question was not \"an impulsive, youthful indiscretion\u201d, but a \"deliberate plan\u201d to obtain cash illegally.\nAdditional factors supportive of County Court\u2019s denial of youthful offender treatment are the recommendation in defendant\u2019s presentence report that he merited \"no leniency\u201d together with the fact that defendant has expressed little understanding or remorse for the consequences of his crime (see, People v Duff, 216 AD2d 689, 690).\nUnder the circumstances presented here, we find no abuse of County Court\u2019s discretion in refusing defendant youthful offender status and no reason to consider youthful offender treatment in the interest of justice (see, People v Buckley, 196 AD2d 915; People v Pearson, 133 AD2d 951).\nMikoll, J.

Pursuant to a written plea agreement, which included a waiver of appeal, defendant agreed to plead guilty to both counts in exchange for the People\u2019s recommendation of a three-year prison sentence, three years of postrelease supervision and no opposition to placement in the Willard drug treatment program. Thereafter, consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a predicate felon to two concurrent prison terms of three years \u2014 together with three years of postrelease supervision \u2014 to be served under parole supervision as part of the Willard drug treatment program pursuant to CPL 410.91. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal was not valid. During the plea colloquy, County Court did not adequately apprise defendant that his appeal rights were separate and distinct from those trial-related rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Mitchell, 144 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2016]). Further, the lengthy written plea agreement in which the waiver of the right to appeal appears does not distinguish in any meaningful way the separate and distinct nature of the appeal waiver (see People v Breault, 150 AD3d 1548, 1548 [2017]; compare People v Corbin, 121 AD3d 803, 803-804 [2014]). As such, we are unable to conclude that \u201cdefendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver\u201d (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1209 [2017] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264).\nTurning to defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant contends that his plea was involuntary because his defense counsel failed to adequately inform him of the deportation consequences of his guilty plea under federal immigration statutes (see 8 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1101 [a] [43]; 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). Defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, \u201cis unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion\u201d (People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]; see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 183, 202-203 [2013]; People v Soprano, 135 AD3d 1243, 1243 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1007 [2016]; cf. People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d 1315, 1316 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016], cert denied 580 US \u2014, 137 S Ct 385 [2016]). Further, our review of the record confirms that defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy or at sentencing that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 182-183; People v Lewis, 143 AD3d at 1185).\nIn any event, defendant\u2019s claim that he was not properly advised that he could be deported as a consequence of his plea is belied by the record. During the plea colloquy, County Court informed defendant of his potential immigration consequences resulting from his plea, and defendant expressly acknowledged in the written plea agreement that he had been afforded the opportunity to discuss with his attorney the potential deportation consequences resulting from his plea and that he understood that his conviction could result in, among other things, his deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization (see People v Lawrence, 148 AD3d 1472, 1474 [2017]; People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d at 1317; People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014]). Finally, to the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is premised upon matters not appearing on the record before us, defendant must pursue this claim by means of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 202-203; People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d at 1386).\nGarry, Rose, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance following a guilty plea. The court found that the waiver of the right to appeal was invalid due to inadequate explanation during the plea colloquy, but rejected the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim regarding deportation consequences, noting that the defendant had been informed about potential immigration repercussions and had acknowledged understanding them. The court stated that any further claims not reflected in the record should be pursued through a CPL article 440 motion.<|eot_id|>"}

As part of the plea agreement, he executed a waiver of his right to appeal. Prior to sentencing, he moved to withdraw his plea, arguing that his counsel failed to accurately advise him regarding the possible sentence he might face if convicted following a trial. County Court denied the motion and defendant was subsequently sentenced to consecutive prison terms of six years and IV2 years, respectively. He now appeals, and we affirm.\nDefendant contends that County Court improperly enhanced his bargained-for sentence by ordering that the two terms of imprisonment run consecutively rather than concurrently. Although this argument is not precluded by defendant\u2019s appeal waiver (see People v Nicholson, 50 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 834 [2008]), it is unpreserved for our review as the record before us indicates that he did not move to withdraw his plea based upon the potential for an enhanced sentence, nor did he object at sentencing or move thereafter to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790-791 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]).\nDefendant further argues that his counsel was ineffective in that he failed to explore alternatives to prison or to adequately explain the plea agreement to defendant. To the extent that this argument survives defendant\u2019s appeal waiver and is preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea, it is not supported by the record. Defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence is excessive is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Small, 82 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 801 [2011]).

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered December 8, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.\nDefendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 15 years to life. Defendant now appeals, contending that his guilty plea was involuntarily obtained.\nWe affirm. Initially, in view of defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the validity of his plea 1ms not been preserved for our review (see, People v Santos, 247 AD2d 651, lv denied 92 NY2d 905). In any event, were we to consider the merits, our review of the record discloses that defendant\u2019s plea was entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently.

Defendant related that he was pleading guilty voluntarily and without coercion, that he was afforded an adequate opportunity to discuss the matter with his counsel and fully understood the ramifications of his plea and the sentencing options available to the court (see, People v Victor, 262 AD2d 872; People v Johnson, 243 AD2d 997, lv denied 91 NY2d 927).

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Sheridan, J.), rendered January 21, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and perjury in the first degree.\nDefendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, all arising out of his alleged possession and sale of cocaine on December 10, 1996. At the arraignment on the indictment, defendant indicated that his name was Anthony Smith, his date of birth was May 17, 1973 and his Social Security number was [ XXX-XX-XXXX ]. Defendant was released on a $40,000 unsecured bail bond. Subsequently, the bail guarantor advised County Court of concerns that defendant was attempting to establish an identity in another name. Consequently, a bail review hearing was conducted on July 21, 1997. At that time, defendant was placed under oath and questioned by County Court concerning his name, age, date of birth, address, Social Security number and prior criminal record. Defendant gave responses that the People\u2019s investigation showed to be false. As a result, the People filed a superior court information charging a single count of perjury in the first degree. Ultimately, as part of a plea bargain, defendant disposed of the indictment and superior court information with guilty pleas to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and perjury in the first degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 to 12 years and 1 to 3 years. Defendant now appeals. We affirm.\nWe first note that by his plea of guilty to peijury in the first degree, defendant waived all factual defenses to that charge, including the present claim that he was snared in the People\u2019s \u201cperjury trap\u201d (see, People v Di Raffaele, 55 NY2d 234, 240; People v Chevalier, 226 AD2d 925, lv denied 88 NY2d 934). In any event, because the questions County Court asked at the July 21, 1997 bail hearing were pertinent to a proper investigation of the issues under consideration, there is no basis for a finding of a perjury trap (see, People v Schenkman, 46 NY2d 232; People v Pomerantz, 46 NY2d 240; People v Tyler, 46 NY2d 251; People v Panico, 111 AD2d 358).\nSecond, in view of the fact that defendant did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction rendered thereon, he has waived his right to appellate review of his claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel or (implicit therein) that his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see, People v Soto, 259 AD2d 904; People v Depta, 257 AD2d 916). Were we to consider defendant\u2019s contentions, we would reject them as lacking in merit. Defendant received an advantageous plea bargain and nothing in the record casts any doubt on the apparent effectiveness of his counsel (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404), defendant\u2019s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666).\nFinally, defendant has pointed to no circumstances supporting his vague contention that the negotiated sentence, which was imposed by County Court in accordance with the plea bargain, was harsh and excessive.\nPeters, Spain, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance and perjury, following his guilty plea as part of a plea bargain.

The court found no grounds to question the voluntariness of the plea or the fairness of the sentence imposed.<|eot_id|>"}

As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced in accordance with a negotiated plea to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of six years to life.\nAt issue here is the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal. In this regard, a review of the record reveals that defendant had not ingested any drugs or alcohol during the 24-hour period prior to his plea, he had discussed the case thoroughly with his attorney, including any potential defenses that he might have to the then-pending charges, and was advised in detail by County Court as to the rights that he was relinquishing by pleading guilty, including the waiver of his right to appeal. Defendant unequivocally acknowledged his understanding of the significance of these waivers. The record further reveals that defendant was fully familiar with the crim inal justice system having previously been thrice convicted of felonies. Under the circumstances, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911).\nTo the extent that defendant claims that his plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is clear that defendant received an extremely advantageous plea, and nothing in the record suggests that counsel\u2019s conduct affected the plea-bargaining process or that the plea was the result of counsel\u2019s poor performance (see, People v Ubrich, 245 AD2d 886, 887, lv denied 91 NY2d 945; see also, People v Perkins, 245 AD2d 956, 959-960, lv denied 91 NY2d 944).

The plea minutes reveal that the defendant was advised by the County Court that the promised prison term would be capped at nine years, with three years of postrelease supervision, provided that the defendant complied with the conditions of his plea agreement. The defendant acknowledged that he understood the terms of the promised sentence and the conditions of his plea agreement. At sentencing, after defense counsel spoke on the defendant\u2019s behalf and the defendant made a statement on his own behalf, the County Court imposed a sentence of nine years of imprisonment plus a period of three years of postrelease supervision. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, an objective reading of the plea agreement demonstrates that its terms were complied with, and the defendant\u2019s misinterpretation of the agreement or his disappointment with his sentence does not suffice as a reason for vacating his plea of guilty (see People v Cataldo, 39 NY2d 578, 579-580 [1976]; People v Hulsey, 244 AD2d 358, 359 [1997]; People v Martin, 235 AD2d 551 [1997]; People v Davis, 161 AD2d 787, 788 [1990]; People v Welch, 129 AD2d 752 [1987]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed, at sentencing, to argue for a lesser sentence than that imposed is belied by the record. Furthermore, the defendant is deemed to have been furnished meaningful representation, since he received an advantageous plea and the record does not cast doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see People v Henry, 95 NY2d 563, 566 [2000]; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Moss, 74 AD3d 1360 [2010]; People v Garrett, 68 AD3d 781, 782 [2009]; People v Boodhoo, 191 AD2d 448, 449 [1993]).\nThe sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). Rivera, J.P., Eng, Chambers, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance after pleading guilty, arguing that his plea was not made knowingly or voluntarily due to misinformation about his potential sentence. The court affirmed the judgment, stating that the plea agreement was properly explained and understood by the defendant, and found no ineffective assistance of counsel, as the defendant received a favorable plea deal. The imposed sentence of nine years of imprisonment plus three years of postrelease supervision was deemed appropriate and not excessive.<|eot_id|>"}

After County Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He now appeals, asserting that his statutory and constitutional speedy trial rights were denied.\nWe affirm. Defendant, by pleading guilty, waived his right to appellate review of his argument regarding his CPL 30.30 speedy trial right (see People v Cintron, 7 AD3d 827, 828 [2004]). Although defendant\u2019s claim of denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial survives his guilty plea, considering the factors set forth in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442, 445 [1975]), defendant has not demonstrated that this right was violated (see People v Cintron, supra at 828). Even accepting defendant\u2019s timeline, he committed a serious crime of selling almost an ounce of cocaine, the delay was not extensive, he was released on bail two days after his arrest and no prejudice has been demonstrated.\nCarpinello, J.P., Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

County Court indicated that it would consider whether to order substance abuse treatment after reviewing the presentence investigation report, but did not promise that treatment would be ordered. Thereafter, the court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to a prison term of four years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. The court declined defendant\u2019s request to order substance abuse treatment, noting that defendant had failed in several prior treatment programs. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s valid waiver of the right to appeal, which she does not challenge, bars her claims that her sentence was harsh and excessive, and that County Court should have directed further substance abuse treatment (see People v Borst, 121 AD3d 1424, 1425 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).

We have reviewed the record and find the presence of one nonfrivolous issue for which the People can have no possible response. The sentencing court ordered the defendant to make restitution to the Port Chester Police Department for unrecovered \"buy money\u201d expended by it during 1986 drug sales which resulted in the defendant\u2019s arrest, and his subsequent conviction in 1988. However, the imposition of restitution was clearly improper since it is well settled that the Police Department, in this instance, was not considered a \"victim\u201d of a crime, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 60.27, to whom restitution may be made (People v Rowe, 152 AD2d 907, affd 75 NY2d 948; People v Woods, 177 AD2d 731). We note that Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 was amended effective November 1, 1991, to authorize restitution to law enforcement agencies for unrecovered funds used in the purchase of drugs as part of investigations leading to convictions (see, Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [9]).\nAccordingly, rather than waste precious resources in, inter alia, assigning new counsel to assert this issue (cf, People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606), we have modified the judgment to the extent indicated. Counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw as counsel is granted (see, Anders v California, 386 US 738, supra; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631). Mangano, P.

This term and defendant\u2019s plea to the lesser charge had been negotiated following a trial on the original charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which trial resulted in a hung jury.\nOn his appeal, defendant contends (1) that the testimony of an accomplice offered before the Grand Jury was uncorroborated and that the District Attorney failed to instruct the Grand Jury, in violation of CPL 190.65 (1), that corroboration of such testimony was required, and (2) that proof of uncharged crimes and hearsay evidence to demonstrate conspiratorial conduct on defendant\u2019s part was impermissibly presented to the Grand Jury. These two errors in the presentation of the case, defendant argues, infected the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding to the extent of requiring dismissal of the indictment, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s guilty plea.\nWe disagree. The evidence before the Grand Jury was legally sufficient to support the indictment. The Grand Jury heard not only the testimony of the accomplice, Willie Sims, who turned police informant, as to the details of the drug sale transaction, it also heard the tape recording of a conversation between Sims and defendant in which defendant admitted knowing about the drug deal, and defendant\u2019s admission to a police officer as well as defendant\u2019s reference on the tapes to himself. Thus, the evidence before the Grand Jury, unexplained and uncontradicted, was legally sufficient to demonstrate all the elements of the crimes charged and defendant\u2019s connection with these crimes. The District Attorney\u2019s failure to instruct the Grand Jury about corroboration, that in any event was legally sufficient (see, CPL 170.10 [1]), does not rise to the level of a constitutional error or adversely affect the integrity of the Grand Jury fact-finding process (see, People v Philipp, 106 AD2d 681, 683; People v Rex, 83 AD2d 753, 754). Where, as here, the legal evidence is sufficient, the integrity of the process is not adversely affected and the claimed error does not rise to a constitutional dimension, defendant\u2019s plea of guilty bars the raising of the issue on appeal (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 7).\nDefendant further argues that the District Attorney erred before the Grand Jury when she responded to a juror\u2019s question of whether the offense of a criminal sale must be found by that body before it could consider a claim of conspiracy. Although we agree that the District Attorney\u2019s answer was not accurate, the effect did not prejudice defendant. The error simply imposed a greater burden on the prosecution than was necessary. We note that contrary to the additional claim of defendant, the evidence before the Grand Jury was sufficient to establish jurisdiction in Broome County. Based on the foregoing analysis, we affirm defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction.\nWeiss, P. J., Crew III, Mahoney and Harvey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, rejecting his appeal that alleged errors in the Grand Jury proceedings, including uncorroborated accomplice testimony and the presentation of hearsay evidence.

We disagree. In order for an out-of-State conviction to qualify an individual as a second felony offender, the offense must carry a sentence of over one year in prison and must be comprised of elements which would constitute a felony in this State, punishable by a sentence of over one year (see, People v Sailor, 65 NY2d 224, 237; People v Gonzalez, 61 NY2d 586, 589). Defendant\u2019s conviction in Florida of the crime of solicitation to deliver cocaine (Fla Stat \u00a7 893.13 [1] [a]), satisfies these criteria. It is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and its elements are analogous to those of Penal Law \u00a7 220.06 (1), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class D felony, punishable by a minimum prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. We conclude that under the circumstances presented here, defendant was properly sentenced as a second felony offender.

Following his arraignment on that indictment, defendant was charged in another indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a written waiver of appeal in open court. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a second felony offender, a prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending that his appeal waiver is invalid and that his agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive.\nInitially, we are unable to conclude that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made inasmuch as County Court failed to explain to defendant the import of the appeal waiver or that his waiver of the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1094-1095 [2015]). Further, \u201c[t]he written waiver [of appeal] also failed to explain the separate and distinct nature of the right being waived\u201d (People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]). As County Court never adequately discussed the waiver of appeal with defendant, the appeal waiver is invalid and defendant is not precluded from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; People v Bates, 146 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2017]; People v Larock, 139 AD3d 1241, 1242-1243 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]; People v Zabawczuk, 128 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 937 [2015]). In so concluding, we flatly reject the unsupportable position taken by the People that \u201c[i]f [defendant\u2019s] plea was voluntary and knowing, then his waiver of appeal as part of that plea was also.\u201d\nTurning to defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence as harsh and excessive, given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record and his agreement to the sentence as part of the negotiated plea agreement in satisfaction of two indictments, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Bates, 146 AD3d at 1076; People v Day, 133 AD3d 920, 920 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d at 1095).\nGarry, Devine, Mulvey and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Otsego County convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance following a guilty plea as part of a negotiated agreement.

However, the court upheld the five-year prison sentence, noting that there were no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction, given the defendant's criminal history and acceptance of the sentence in the plea agreement.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant appeals, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as evidenced by counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of his right to challenge the credibility of the confidential informant by requesting an Aguilar /Spinelli hearing.\nBy his failure either to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, the issue of whether defendant received the effective assistance of counsel has not been preserved for our review (see People v Johnson, 288 AD2d 501, 502 [2001]). Were we to consider the issue, however, we would find it to be without merit. The failure of defense counsel to make a particular pretrial motion does not, by itself, establish ineffective legal assistance (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Garnsey, 288 AD2d 761, 762 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 754 [2002]). Our review of the record discloses that defense counsel made appropriate pretrial motions and provided defendant with competent representation as evidenced, in particular, by his negotiation of a most favorable plea (see People v Powell, 299 AD2d 574, 575 [2002]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea is similarly not preserved for our review, given the failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685 [1993]; People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]).

In satisfaction of the indictment, he pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to 12 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision on the sale count and a consecutive term of 6V2 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on the possession count. Defendant appeals.\nAlthough defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his waiver of the right to appeal, that claim is not preserved for our review because the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Bonville, 104 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2013]). While a guilty plea does not forfeit review of the denial of a suppression motion (see CPL 710.70 [2]; People v Issac, 107 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2013]), such review is foreclosed by defendant\u2019s valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094-1095 [2013]).

The defendant pleaded guilty to that crime and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 71 months.\nThe defendant challenged his status as a second felony offender, contending that his prior federal conviction did not con stitute a felony under New York State law. The County Court, in a written decision, determined that \u201cthe People have failed to prove that the conduct proscribed by 21 USC 841 (a) (1) and 846, would necessarily constitute the Felony of Conspiracy in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Degree under the applicable laws of the State of New York,\u201d on the ground that the federal indictment did not allege that the defendant conspired to \u201csell\u201d the cocaine. We disagree.\nThe defendant\u2019s federal conviction is the equivalent of a conviction under New York law of the crime of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a class E felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 105.10 [1]). A person is guilty of conspiracy in the fourth degree under Penal Law \u00a7 105.10 (1) when he or she agrees with one or more persons to commit a class B or class C felony. The underlying crime under New York law is defined in Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 (1), possession of a narcotic drug with intent to sell it, which is a class B felony. The term \u201cdistribute\u201d in 21 USC \u00a7 841 (a) (1) is the equivalent of the term \u201csell\u201d under the New York Penal Law (see People v Rexach, 220 AD2d 362; People v Vasquez, 167 AD2d 236; Hendley v Clark, 147 AD2d 347, 349). Cocaine is a narcotic drug listed in Schedule II (b) (4) of Public Health Law \u00a7 3306 (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 [7]).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.

The appellate court reversed the sentence, adjudicated the defendant as a second felony offender based on a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and remitted the case for resentencing. The court determined that the federal conviction equates to a fourth-degree conspiracy felony under New York law, rejecting the defendant's argument that it did not qualify as a felony.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court denied his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment in which he contended that the grand jury proceedings had been defective. The case proceeded to trial and, while the juiy was deliberating following the presentation of proof, defendant elected to accept a plea offer by the People. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of all charges, he waived his right to appeal and he received a sentence, as a second felony offender, of two years in prison followed by 18 months of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant argues that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel, evidentiary errors occurred at trial, and the integrity of the grand jury was compromised by the presence of a law enforcement officer as . a grand juror. A guilty plea generally \u201cmarks the end of a criminal case, not a gateway to further litigation\u201d (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5 [1985]). Thus, alleged errors that are normally forfeited by a guilty plea include, as relevant here, an assertion of ineffective assistance that is not directly related to the plea bargaining process or the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Parilla, 8 NY3d 654, 660 [2007]; People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]), an argument regarding evidentiary rulings at trial (see People v Campbell, 73 NY2d 481, 486 [1989]; People v Mead, 198 AD2d 612, 613 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 899 [1993]), and a challenge to the grand jury proceedings that does not go to the issue of jurisdiction (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 231 [2000]; People v Robertson, 279 AD2d 711, 712-713 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 805 [2001]). We further note that, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the record reveals that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d 987, 987 [2010]; People v Cruz, 74 AD3d 1496, 1497 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 803 [2010]), and accordingly his current arguments are also precluded by that valid waiver (see People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]).\nPeters, J.P., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant executed a written waiver of appeal in open court. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony, to an agreed-upon prison term of 17 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. County Court also ordered defendant\u2019s sentence to run consecutively to any remaining undischarged term of imprisonment that he was required to serve. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s initial contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Defendant, who had extensive prior knowledge of the criminal justice system, was advised during the plea colloquy \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,\u201d and defendant acknowledged that he was expected to waive that right as a component of the plea agreement (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]). Defendant then executed a detailed written waiver of the right to appeal and advised County Court that he had only done so after discussing the document with defense counsel. The written waiver and plea colloquy accordingly establish that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal from his conviction and sentence (see People v Vellon, 128 AD3d 1274, 1274-1275 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1043 [2015]; People v Brown, 125 AD3d 1049, 1049 [2015]).

The sole argument raised by defendant on this appeal is that the predicate felony statement filed by the People was defective inasmuch as it did not indicate that his prior felony conviction was a violent felony. Defendant\u2019s failure to raise this issue before County Court, however, has rendered the matter unpreserved for our review (see People v Collier, 35 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2006]; People v Ochs, 16 AD3d 971, 971 [2005]). In any event, although the statement did not satisfy the technical requirements of CPL 400.21 (2), County Court read the statement to defendant and he freely admitted that he was validly convicted of the prior felony described therein. Having received adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to the prior conviction, the statutory requirements were substantially complied with (see People v Collier, supra at 1038; People v Ochs, supra at 972).\nMercure, J.E, Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

As a result, defendant was charged with various crimes, and eventually pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to waive his right to appeal, cooperate with the prosecution by testifying against his codefendant and, in return, receive a sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years in prison. Before concluding the plea proceedings, Supreme Court advised defendant that the agreed-upon sentence would only be honored if defendant appeared at sentencing and did not commit another crime before that time. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, the court sentenced him in absentia to 42/s to 14 years in prison. A bench warrant was issued for defendant\u2019s arrest and, more than five years later, he appeared before the court. At that time, the court denied defendant\u2019s request to be resentenced to a lesser sentence and imposed the original sentence. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole argument is that the 42/3-to-14-year prison sentence imposed upon him in absentia is harsh and excessive. Preliminarily, we note that defendant is not precluded from raising this challenge by the waiver of appeal inasmuch as the record does not disclose that he understood \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Lee, 51 AD3d 1217, 1217 [2008]; People v Newcomb, 45 AD3d 890, 891 [2007]; compare People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 671 [2007]). Consequently, we may consider the merits of defendant\u2019s claim and whether the circumstances warrant the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction in reducing the sentence (see CPL 470.15 [3] [c]; [6] [b]).\nIn support of his argument that the sentence should be reduced, defendant points to the successful business endeavors, family stability and spiritual development he has attained over the course of the past five years which have made him a productive member of society. While this may be true, these accomplishments were made after defendant had breached his plea agreement and while he was a fugitive from justice. At the time of entering his plea, defendant was well aware of the consequences of failing to appear for sentencing as Supreme Court specifically informed him that he could be sentenced to up to 5 to 15 years in prison. In view of the foregoing, and considering defendant\u2019s fairly extensive criminal record as well as the fact that he was not a youth at the time of the subject crime, we discern neither an abuse of discretion nor the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Shaw, 51 AD3d 1062 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 964 [2008]; People v Favor, 49 AD3d 915, 916 [2008]).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Rose, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur.

Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of not more than three years. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his application to require the prosecution to furnish him any sworn statement made by a law enforcement official concerning dealings between such official and one Richard Hogue, an alleged informant. (See People v. Oleary, 33 A D 2d 814.) The denial by the trial court of appellant\u2019s request for inspection of the probation report was a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court. (People v. Michael O. [Anonymous], 22 N Y 2d 831.)

After waiving indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a single charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.31) contained in a superior court information. On appeal, defendant contends that the superior court information was jurisdictionally defective because the waiver of indictment {see, CPL 195.20) states that defendant will be charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree instead of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nOur review of the record supports the People\u2019s position that this variation was solely due to a typographical error in the waiver of indictment and defendant was on notice of the true crime to be charged (cf., People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850). Significantly, the waiver of indictment specifically refers to Penal Law \u00a7 220.31, the correct numeric citation for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Thus, both the waiver of indictment and superior court information both correctly allege a violation of Penal Law \u00a7 220.31. Notably, although the wrong statutory provision was mentioned early in the arraignment proceedings before County Court, defendant was thereafter specifically told by the court that he was being charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Moreover, although his attorney asked that the superior court information be amended to reflect the correct date, no mention was made of any error in the actual crime charged. Accordingly, we conclude that any error made was purely ministerial and nonprejudicial to defendant.\nCardona, P. J., Crew III, White and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur.

After the denial of her motion to suppress certain evidence discovered by the police during a search of her bedroom, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony, on August 26, 1977. The court immediately vacated her conviction and, adjudging her to be a youthful offender, sentenced defendant to a term of five years probation. Seeking a dismissal of the indictment against her, defendant now appeals and argues that her motion to suppress should have been granted because the search of her bedroom was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We hold that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. The search of her bedroom to which defendant objects was undertaken by the police only after they obtained a written consent from defendant\u2019s stepfather, Lester Platt. The basis of defendant\u2019s appeal is that her stepfather lacked the requisite authority to consent to the search. We cannot agree. The bedroom search was precipitated when a high school girl who was sharing defendant\u2019s bedroom for the duration of the school year was apprehended at school selling marihuana cigarettes. Since he was acting as a guardian of the girl in accordance with an agreement with her parents, Mr. Platt was immediately summoned to the school. He later agreed in writing to permit the police to conduct the search. While defendant emphasizes that six weeks previous to the search her stepfather had stopped living at the family residence as a result of a marital dispute, it is clear that he remained on friendly terms with his wife and family and his role as father was not significantly diminished. He continued to have free access to the home, visited there often, and the lease on the house with an accompanying option to buy remained in his name. Moreover, when he arrived with the police at the house, Mrs. Platt, his wife and defendant\u2019s mother, conceded that she assumed a search was to be made and acquiesced therein. Under all of these circumstances, we hold that Mr. Platt clearly \"possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises * * * to be inspected\u201d so as to legitimize his consent to the subject search (United States v Matlock, 415 US 164, 171), and, accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.

In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years as a second felony offender. Arguing that County Court erred by accepting his guilty plea, defendant appeals.\nDuring the plea allocution, defendant stated that he had been acting as a \u201cgo-between\u201d during the transaction and was acting on behalf of the buyer. Unsatisfied with that allocution, County Court explained that if defendant was claiming that he was acting on behalf of the buyer, he should proceed to trial with an agency defense. Defendant, however, adamantly expressed that he did not want to go to trial and he specifically waived any possible agency defense. Unconvinced that defendant understood what he was pleading to, the court permitted defendant to confer with his counsel. After a brief conference with his attorney, defendant explained that he had in fact acted on behalf of the seller of the cocaine. Defendant stated that he knew he was selling cocaine and that it was illegal to do so.\nEssentially, defendant now argues that he did not enter into his plea knowingly because he did not understand that he had a possible agency defense to pursue or what such a defense meant. Failing to challenge his plea by a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has failed to preserve this issue (see, CPL 220.60; see also, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Smith, 248 AD2d 891; People v Jones, 240 AD2d 950, 951, lv denied 91 NY2d 875; People v Fredericks [Fredricks], 235 AD2d 254, lvs denied 89 NY2d 1011). In any event, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Berthiaume, 240 AD2d 953; People v Battiste, 238 AD2d 724, lv denied 90 NY2d 901). The record clearly shows that County Court took substantial efforts to ensure that defendant understood what he was pleading to and that he would be waiving the right to raise certain defenses at trial by pleading guilty (see, People v Costanza, 244 AD2d 988).\nMercure, J.

The defendant argued that he did not fully understand the implications of his plea, particularly regarding a potential agency defense, but the court found that he had knowingly and voluntarily entered the plea after conferring with his counsel. The defendant's failure to challenge the plea through the appropriate motions resulted in the preservation of this issue, leading to the affirmation of the judgment.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant now appeals contending, among other things, that his waiver and resulting plea were involuntary.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the record reflects that his waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. County Court\u2019s explanation of the significance of the appeal waiver to defendant, along with defendant\u2019s detailed written waiver executed in open court, adequately described the nature and scope of the rights waived. In addition, County Court confirmed that defendant had discussed the matter with counsel and ensured that such waiver had not been coerced (see People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896-897 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1057-1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]). Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which to invalidate defendant\u2019s valid waiver.\nTo the extent that defendant separately challenges the voluntariness of his plea, the issue survives his waiver of the right to appeal; his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, however, renders this issue unpreserved for our review (see People v Nunez, 56 AD3d 897, 898 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 928 [2009]; People v Vallance, 49 AD3d 917, 917 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 845 [2008]). Further, \u201c[t]he narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not triggered here inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during his allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea\u201d (People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]).\nWe reach a similar conclusion regarding defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim\u2014namely, that to the extent that it survives his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders this claim unpreserved for our review (see id. at 781; People v Crudup, 45 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2007]). Moreover, in view of defendant\u2019s statements that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel and was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation, and based upon our review of the record as a whole, reversal in the interest of justice is unwarranted here.\nFinally, defendant\u2019s assertion that the negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Crudup, 45 AD3d at 1112).\nSpain, Malone Jr., Kavanagh and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

County Court imposed upon defendant, a second felony offender, the agreed-upon sentence of six years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.\nDefendant first contends that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because County Court failed to advise him of the trial-related rights he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 361 [2013]). Defendant did not advance this issue in an appropriate postallocution motion, despite having had sufficient opportunity to do so, and it is accordingly unpreserved for our review (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 381-382 [2015]; People v Forest, 141 AD3d 967, 968 [2016]). The record, in any event, \u201cshows that defendant was fully advised of his trial-related rights during the allocution\u201d (People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]; see People v Walker, 135 AD3d 1244, 1245-1246 [2016]).\nDefendant\u2019s further challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver is unavailing. County Court explained the right to appeal to defendant and distinguished it from the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, all of which defendant confirmed that he understood. He then reviewed a detailed written waiver with counsel and signed it in open court. Defendant\u2019s appeal waiver was therefore a knowing, intelligent and voluntary one (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d at 1538).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining claims are not properly before us. The assertion that defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel, to the extent that it survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver, is unpreserved given the lack of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Lobaton, 140 AD3d 1534, 1535 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 972 [2016]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2008]). By pleading guilty, defendant waived his contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the special prosecutor (see People v Abdullah, 122 AD3d 958, 959 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]; People v Gryner, 116 AD3d 1247, 1248 [2014]). Lastly, defendant\u2019s protestation that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Constantopoules, 141 AD3d 942, 943 [2016]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr., Rose and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea and sentence of six years in prison.

Other claims made by the defendant, including ineffective assistance of counsel and challenges to the sentence, were deemed unpreserved for review due to the nature of his guilty plea and valid appeal waiver.<|eot_id|>"}

The plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to three years in prison, to be followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea on the ground that his plea was not entered into voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently. County Court denied the motion and thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. \u201cWhether to allow withdrawal of a guilty plea is left to the sound discretion of County Court, and will generally not be permitted absent some evidence of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement\u201d (People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 922 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; accord People v Wilson, 92 AD3d 981, 981 [2012]). Here, defendant\u2019s contention that he did not understand what he was pleading guilty to or that he was to be sentenced to three years in prison under the plea agreement is belied by the record. A review of the plea colloquy reveals that defendant had previously discussed the plea and its consequences with counsel, was fully apprised by County Court of the terms of the plea agreement and heard and understood the terms prior to entering his plea. Accordingly, we conclude that County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion was a sound exercise of its discretion (see People v Keating, 96 AD3d 1107, 1108 [2012]; People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]).\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The plea allocution and the written waiver of appeal executed in open court demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011]; People v Jean-Francois, 82 AD3d 1366, 1366 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 797 [2011]). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea and his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, which survive his appeal waiver and were preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d 811, 812 [2008]), are nevertheless without merit. The plea minutes reflect that defendant admitted his guilt and affirmatively responded to County Court\u2019s inquiries regarding the elements of the crime. Consequently, we conclude that the allocution was sufficient (see People v Ackley, 84 AD3d 1639, 1640 [2011]; People v Kaszubinski, 55 AD3d 1133, 1135-1136 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 855 [2009]). To the extent that defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, such claim involves matters outside of the record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Leszczynski, 96 AD3d 1162, 1163 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 998 [2012]). In any event, the record demonstrates that counsel negotiated a favorable plea and defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he had been provided enough time to discuss the plea with counsel and that he was satisfied with his services (see People v Wilson, 92 AD3d at 981-982 [2012]; People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d at 1347).\nPeters, PJ., Lahtinen, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ, concur.

The court also rejected his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and sufficiency of the plea, noting that these issues were either without merit or more appropriately addressed in a separate motion.<|eot_id|>"}

He contends on this appeal that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive in view of his youth (22 years of age at the time of sentencing) and his lack of a prior criminal record. We disagree. A sentence that falls within the permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872). No extraordinary circumstances have been shown to exist here nor can we discern any abuse of judicial discretion in light of the fact that a sentence of SVs to 25 years (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) could have been imposed.\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

He pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon the understanding that he would receive an aggregate prison sentence of seven years to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. While he was offered a shorter prison term of five years if he waived his right to appeal, he initially rejected that offer. He then moved to withdraw his guilty plea. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion, but allowed him to execute an appeal waiver and imposed an aggregate prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision.\nDefendant now appeals and argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered. Although such a challenge \u201csurvives his appeal waiver and is preserved due to his motion to withdraw the plea\u201d (People v Johnson, 77 AD3d 986, 986 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 743 [2011]; see People v Ortiz, 69 AD3d 966, 967 [2010]), we nevertheless find it to be unpersuasive. Defendant contends that he was under a great deal of stress at the time he pleaded guilty and did not understand the terms of the plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, however, he was advised at length as to the terms of the agreement and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. Defendant expressed no concerns in response, instead assuring County Court that he understood his rights and was proceeding freely, had consulted and was satisfied with defense counsel, and admitted his guilt. The record thus demonstrates that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was in all respects knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Shovah, 67 AD3d 1257, 1258 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 773 [2010]; People v Quinones, 51 AD3d 1226, 1227 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 938 [2008]).\nLahtinen, Malone Jr., Kavanagh and Garry, JJ., concur.

His arrest also resulted in the additional charge of violating the terms of his probation. Defendant entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to the terms of which he pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the multicount indictment in exchange for being sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. A concurrent sentence of 21/s to 7 years also was imposed following his admission to violating the terms of his probation. In conjunction therewith, defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.\nOn this appeal, defendant contends that the waiver of his right to appeal does not encompass his right to challenge his sentence inasmuch as he was not advised, at the plea allocution, of the maximum that he could receive. We agree (see People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513), but nevertheless affirm. Our review of the record convinces us that the sentences imposed were not harsh or excessive given defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, the fact that he was serving a sentence of probation when he committed additional drug-related crimes and that he received the sentences under review as part of a favorable plea bargain pursuant to which several other charges against him were dismissed. As we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences in the interest of justice, they will not be disturbed (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 815; People v Mickens, 275 AD2d 818, 819).

The plea agreement contemplated that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender and would receive a determinate prison term of between 6 and 12 years, to be followed by a term of postrelease supervision. County Court ultimately sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years to be followed by postrelease supervision of three years, that sentence to run consecutively to a prison sentence he was already serving. Defendant now appeals, arguing solely that the sentence was harsh and excessive.\nWe disagree and affirm. It is well settled that \u201c[a] sentence that falls within the permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that the sentencing court abused its discretion or that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification in the interest of justice\u201d (People v Pailin, 306 AD2d 558, 558 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 597 [2003]; see People v McCombs, 83 AD3d 1296, 1296 [2011]). The sentence here was within the permissible statutory range and, after reviewing the seriousness of the offense, defendant\u2019s prior criminal history and the fact that the sentence was both within the negotiated range and well below the statutory maximum, we discern no circumstances that would warrant its modification (see People v Davis, 83 AD3d 1210, 1213 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 794 [2011]; People v Wilson, 78 AD3d 1213, 1217 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 747 [2011]).\nPeters, EJ., Stein, McCarthy, Garry and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Washington County convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison with three years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutively to another sentence he was serving.

County Court refused to impose the recommended sentence, however, and denied defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty plea upon the ground that defendant left the State and failed to \"provid[e] material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of [drug offenders]\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 65.00 [1] [b] [iii]). The parties then entered into a further agreement whereby the People agreed to forego a contemplated prosecution for bail jumping in the first degree and defendant agreed to accept a sentence of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years on his original plea and, further, waived his right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with that agreement, defendant now appeals.\nIn view of defendant\u2019s acceptance of the subsequent plea agreement and express waiver of his right to appeal, he may not now challenge County Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 281; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039). Although defendant did exhibit some reluctance in accepting the subsequent plea agreement, a fair reading of the minutes indicates no evidence of threats or coercion but merely defendant\u2019s frustration with the reality of his situation and the prospect of a longer prison term were he to reject the People\u2019s offer (see, People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, lv denied 79 NY2d 949).\nMikoll, J.

On December 17, 1992, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years to life.\nOn this appeal, defendant contends that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made because his attorney neglected to advise him, as an alien, of the potential for deportation as the result of his guilty plea. We disagree. The fact that defendant was subject to deportation pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (see, 8 USC \u00a7 1251 et seg.) is a collateral consequence of his plea about which counsel was under no obligation to advise (see, People v Boodhoo, 191 AD2d 448; People v Avila, 177 AD2d 426, lv denied 79 NY2d 918). Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that counsel was even aware of defendant\u2019s alien status at the time he entered the plea. A review of the plea allocution reveals that, in all other respects, defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made and the judgment should therefore be affirmed.\nMikoll, J.

Thereafter, a presentence investigation was conducted and the Probation Department recommended that defendant be adjudicated a youthful offender. At sentencing, defense counsel requested that, notwithstanding the plea agreement, County Court and the prosecutor consent to youthful offender treatment. The request was refused, the aforementioned sentence was imposed and this appeal ensued.\nInitially, we note \u201cthe general rule that a defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of a request for youthful offender treatment does not survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal\u201d (People v Harrington, 281 AD2d 748; see, People v Congdon, 269 AD2d 615). We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the sentence was illegally imposed and that his challenge survives the waiver. Specifically, he contends that County Court failed to exercise its discretion by rejecting defendant\u2019s plea for leniency based solely on the plea agreement. Our review of the sentencing minutes satisfies us that the court did not reject defendant\u2019s request for youthful offender treatment based solely on the plea agreement. Instead, the court determined that, under the circumstances, the sentence which had been negotiated by the parties was an appropriate disposition. As such, defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of youthful offender treatment does not survive the waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Wagoner, 234 AD2d 831). Defendant\u2019s alternative argument, that his waiver of appeal should be vacated inasmuch as it was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered, is both unpreserved for review and lacking in merit (see, People v Dopp, 261 AD2d 715, 716). Accordingly, we perceive no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, Peters, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

The appellate court upheld the conviction and sentence, ruling that the challenge regarding youthful offender status did not survive the waiver of the right to appeal, and the defendant's claim that the waiver was not made knowingly or intelligently was deemed both unpreserved and meritless.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon prison sentence of IV2 to 3 years, to run consecutively to the prison term defendant was already serving.

Following plea negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime charged and waived his right to appeal. In exchange, defendant was to receive a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years\u2019 probation. Approximately 2V2 years after defendant failed to appear for sentencing, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. In May 2000, defendant was returned to court. County Court denied his oral motion to vacate his plea on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over him and thereafter sentenced him to one year in jail. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, as well as by his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, his oral motion to withdraw his plea preserves only the ground stated as the basis for the motion (see People v Spulka, 285 AD2d 840, 840 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 643 [2001]). Inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt, negated an essential element of the crime or cast significant doubt on his guilt, the exception to the preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Hermance, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]). Because defendant failed to appear for sentencing, we reject his argument that County Court lacked jurisdiction to impose sentence (see Matter of Root v Kapelman, 67 AD2d 131, 137 [1979], lv denied 47 NY2d 706 [1979]). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentence will not be reviewed given his knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 935 [2004]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

At the same time, he was sentenced, again as a second felony of fender, to 12x/2 to 25 years in prison upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. These sentences were directed to run consecutively, resulting in defendant having to serve an aggregate term of 25 years to life in prison.

A police search of his vehicle disclosed drugs and weapons stored in the trunk. Defendant was indicted on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and third degrees, third degree criminal possession of a weapon and third degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Defense counsel subsequently made a motion for, inter alia, a probable cause hearing leading to dismissal of the indictment based on the alleged illegal actions of the police in stopping defendant and searching his car. County Court granted the request for a probable cause hearing, but before the hearing could be held, defendant pleaded guilty to second degree criminal possession of a controlled substance in full satisfaction of the four-count indictment. Defendant was sentenced to a term of incarceration of seven years to life. Defendant appeals.\nIt is defendant\u2019s contention that County Court should have issued an order dismissing the indictment against him on the ground that the police lacked probable cause to stop him and to search his car, having initially stopped defendant under the mistaken belief that he was an individual for whom they had an outstanding arrest warrant. It is apparent, however, that by entering a guilty plea prior to the probable cause hearing, defendant waived his right to raise this issue on appeal (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, 218, cert denied 475 US 1150; People v Zeoli, 212 AD2d 935, lv denied 85 NY2d 916; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 259-261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026).\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Our review of the record discloses that defense counsel was present with defendant and provided him with competent legal representation throughout all stages of the proceedings, including negotiating a favorable plea bargain on his behalf (see, People v Strempack, 134 AD2d 799, 800, affd 71 NY2d 1015; see also, People v Noble, 209 AD2d 735, 736, lv denied 84 NY2d 1036). We conclude that defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was fully satisfied (see, People v Pray, 199 AD2d 646-647, lv denied 83 NY2d 809).\nFinally, we are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The sentence, which was the product of defendant\u2019s plea bargain, fell within the statutory guidelines and under the circumstances presented here, cannot be said to constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court (see, People v Pray, supra, at 647).\nCardona, P.

P.\nAppeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), entered December 20, 1984, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, without a hearing.\nDefendant was indicted for one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.21 [1]). Subsequently, pursuant to plea negotiations, he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.18) and was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain to a prison term of 8 Vs years to life.\nDefendant appealed his conviction, which was affirmed without opinion by this court (99 AD2d 931). Thereafter, defendant moved pursuant to CPL article 440 for an order vacating his conviction. In his motion, defendant argued that the plea colloquy was insufficient and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. County Court, without a hearing, denied defendant\u2019s motion and this appeal, by permission, ensued.\nFirst, we have reviewed the plea colloquy and find it to be sufficient. Moreover, adequate appellate review of this issue was available upon appeal from the judgment of conviction. Accordingly, this aspect of the motion was properly denied (see, CPL 440.10 [2]).\nSecond, a review of the record reveals that there is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel obtained a plea to the lesser charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree with a sentence of 8 Vs years to life, whereas defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, with a possible sentence of 25 years to life (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00). It cannot be said that counsel\u2019s advice to defendant to accept this plea offer prior to the suppression hearing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant has simply failed to set forth sufficient facts to make a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied without a hearing.\nOrder affirmed. Kane, J. P., Casey, Weiss, Mikoll and Levine, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Albany County denied the defendant's motion to vacate his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which he had entered as part of a plea bargain.

County Court deferred sentencing so that defendant could participate in a drug treatment court program, with the proviso that, in the event that he was unsuccessfully discharged from the program, he could be sentenced to up to eight years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was thereafter indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Based upon this new indictment, defendant was charged with violating his drug treatment court program agreement. After being advised by County Court that he would be sentenced to a 10-year term of imprisonment, defendant resolved the new indictment by pleading guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and also admitted to violating the terms of his participation in the drug treatment court program. As a consequence, County Court sentenced defendant to consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment, with an aggregate of three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claim that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary is belied by the record. Accordingly, given defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver, he is precluded from arguing that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Nickell, 49 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2008]; People v Romano, 45 AD3d 910, 912 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Carpinello, Kane and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

The People and defendant jointly recommended that he be sentenced to a prison term of 12 years to be followed by post-release supervision of five years, and the People further agreed not to request that he be sentenced as a persistent felony offender. County Court imposed the recommended sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nDefendant claims that County Court improperly sentenced him as a second felony drug offender, and we agree. Initially, this argument implicates the legality of his sentence and, as such, survives his appeal waiver (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]; People v Mosley, 54 AD3d 1098, 1099 [2008]). The record does not reflect that the People filed a predicate felony statement prior to sentencing (see CPL 400.21 [2]; Penal Law \u00a7 70.71 [4] [b]), and they concede that defendant did not have \u201can opportunity to be heard with respect to . . . predicate sentencing\u201d (People v Anthony, 52 AD3d 864, 865 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 733 [2008]). Indeed, defendant was not advised during the plea proceedings or thereafter that he was to be sentenced as a second felony drug offender, and County Court did not explicitly find him to be such an offender or sentence him as such (see CPL 400.21 [4]). As the provisions of CPL 400.21 were not substantially complied with, remittal is required so that defendant may be afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding his prior convictions prior to resentencing (see People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]; People v Anthony, 52 AD3d at 865; People v Fields, 92 AD2d 749 [1983]).\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that his guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered given County Court\u2019s failure to correctly advise him of the maximum term of imprisonment he faced is unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mayers, 74 NY2d 931, 932 [1989]; People v Campbell, 66 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2009]), and \u201cwe decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice\u201d (People v Anthony, 52 AD3d at 865; cf. People v Bryant, 180 AD2d 874, 875-876 [1992]).\nRose, Lahtinen, Kavanagh and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Defendant was later determined to be a second felony drug offender who had been previously convicted of a violent felony, and was sentenced to six years in prison, plus three years of postrelease supervision (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [1] [b], [c]; [4] [a]). Defendant now appeals, claiming that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial and was improperly classified for sentencing purposes as a second felony offender who had been previously convicted of a prior violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4] [a], [b] [i]).\nInitially, we note that when defendant entered his guilty plea \u201che forfeited his right to claim that he was deprived of a speedy trial under CPL 30.30\u201d (People v O\u2019Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]; see People v Zakrzewski, 69 AD3d 1055 [2010], Iv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]). As for his classification as a second felony drug offender who had been previously convicted of a prior violent felony, such classification was based on defendant\u2019s 1999 conviction for attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 [former (4)]). A plea of guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.02) is a violent felony offense if, when entered, the plea was to a \u201c \u2018lesser grade\u2019 \u201d of an offense in the indictment that qualifies as a violent felony (People v Dickerson, 85 NY2d 870, 872 [1995], quoting CPL 220.20; see Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 [1] [d]). Defendant argues that County Court should not have classified his prior conviction as a violent felony offense because the accusatory instrument used in that proceeding was a superior court information \u2014 and not an indictment\u2014 and, as such, his guilty plea to the lesser grade offense cannot qualify as a violent felony. We disagree. A \u201csuperior court information has the same force and effect as an indictment and all procedures and provisions of law applicable to indictments are also applicable to superior court informations, except where otherwise expressly provided\u201d (CPL 200.15). Moreover, \u201c[e]xcept as used in [a]rticle 190, the term indictment shall include a superior court information\u201d (CPL 200.10). Thus, defendant\u2019s plea to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree was properly determined to be a violent felony offense (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 [1] [d]; People v Henry, 52 AD3d 841, 843 [2008], Iv denied 11 NY3d 789 [2008]).\nSpain, J.P., Stein, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\n. Defendant also received a sentence of a conditional discharge on his convictions for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree.\n. The uniform sentence and commitment form improperly refers to defendant as a second violent felony offender.\n. Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (former [4]) has since been repealed (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.02, as amended by L 2006, ch 742, \u00a7 1) and subsequently removed from Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 (as amended by L 2007, ch 7, \u00a7 32).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's judgment following his guilty plea to three charges, including one for criminal possession of a controlled substance, after his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds was denied. The defendant, classified as a second felony drug offender due to a prior violent felony conviction, argued against this classification, but the court upheld it, noting that the superior court information used in his prior case was equivalent to an indictment. The judgment was affirmed, with a minor correction regarding the categorization of the defendant as a second violent felony offender in the sentencing documentation.<|eot_id|>"}

He was subsequently indicted for the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, conspiracy in the second degree and criminal facilitation in the second degree. Preliminarily, defendant moved, inter alia, for discovery, inspection and disclosure, suppression of evidence, dismissal of the indictment and/or pretrial hearings addressing the legality of procedures used by the police agencies.\nCounty Court, inter alia, partially granted defendant\u2019s motion by ordering a variety of hearings prior to trial, including Huntley and Mapp hearings, but failed to address those issues concerning the arresting officer\u2019s lack of geographical jurisdiction, due process and discovery. Subsequent to the suppression hearing, where sufficient probable cause for the arrest was found, defendant entered a plea of guilty to conspiracy in the second degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 4Vi to 9 years. Defendant now appeals.\nWhile defendant has not waived his right to appeal, his guilty plea \"generally represents a compromise or bargain struck after negotiation between defendant and the People. As such, it marks the end of a criminal case, not a gateway to further litigation\u201d (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5). It similarly serves as a forfeiture of nonjurisdictional defects so that only an \"extremely limited group of issues * * * may properly be raised on a subsequent appeal\u201d (People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026). With these precepts at hand, and no challenge to the validity of the plea, we find that defendant\u2019s contentions addressing the arresting officer\u2019s lack of geographical jurisdiction or, alternatively, that the evidence resulting therefrom should have been suppressed, were waived by his plea of guilty.\nSuch plea similarly forecloses appellate review of defendant\u2019s contentions regarding County Court\u2019s denial of requests for additional discovery, inspection and disclosure (see, People v Cusani, 153 AD2d 574). As to defendant\u2019s contentions regarding egregious police conduct by its use of an informant who called and harassed him over a six-month period, we find nothing in the record indicating conduct rising to the level of misconduct found in People v Isaacson (44 NY2d 511). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s plea waives appellate review of this issue as well (see, People v Persico, 131 AD2d 603, lv denied 70 NY2d 716; People v Rodriguez, 79 AD2d 539, affd 55 NY2d 776).\nFinally, defendant challenges the finding of probable cause contending that it was based upon information supplied by a confidential informant whose reliability was not established. A review of the record reflects that the first-hand knowledge of police officers provided sufficient probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest, rendering any concern regarding the reliability of the confidential informant irrelevant (see, Spinelli v United States, 393 US 410; Aguilar v Texas, 378 US 108).\nAs to all other contentions raised, we find them to be without merit.\nMikoll, J. P., Mercure, Crew III and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant convicted of conspiracy in the second degree after pleading guilty, following an arrest related to cocaine possession and sale. The County Court had partially granted motions for various hearings but did not address all the issues raised by the defendant. The appellate court ruled that the guilty plea waived the defendant's right to challenge the arresting officer's jurisdiction, the denial of discovery requests, and claims of police misconduct, affirming the judgment based on sufficient probable cause established by police officers' firsthand knowledge, regardless of a confidential informant's reliability.<|eot_id|>"}

Nevertheless, were we to consider the issue, we would find no abuse of discretion on the part of County Court inasmuch as the record reveals that the court was aware of the mitigating factors surrounding defendant\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking and that this was his first felony offense.

By failing to make the appropriate motion, defendant deprived County Court of the opportunity to address the alleged deficiency and, if necessary, take corrective action (see, People v Tumminia, 272 AD2d 634, lv denied 95 NY2d 939). In any event, defendant\u2019s claim that his plea is the product of confusion and coercion has no support in the record.\nDefendant\u2019s claim that the 4 to 15-year sentence is harsh and excessive is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733) and lacks merit in any event. Considering the nature of the crimes, the fact that the sentence was within the statutory guidelines and the substantial measure of leniency accorded defendant by the imposition of concurrent sentences for crimes that arose out of separate and distinct criminal transactions, we conclude that County Court did not abuse its discretion and there are no extraordinary circumstances which would warrant the exercise of our authority to modify the sentence in the interest of justice.\nMercure, J.

Defendant was also separately charged in a superior court information with grand larceny in the third degree, and the Albany County District Attorney filed a petition alleging that she had violated probation. The Attorney General and District Attorney negotiated a joint plea agreement to resolve all three matters, which required defendant\u2019s cooperation with the conspiracy investigation. Pursuant thereto, defendant entered a guilty plea to count 195 of the indictment, which charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, and she admitted violating probation. As part of that agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal as to all three matters and signed a written waiver of appeal.\nAt sentencing, County Court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a one-year jail term with credit for time served on the violation petition. With respect to the attempted grand larceny conviction, the court granted defendant a conditional discharge and ordered her to pay certain restitution. The court subsequently imposed a one-year jail term on the drug-related conviction, to be served consecutively to the one-year term imposed for violating probation. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.\nOn appeal, defendant argues that she did not get the benefit of the promised plea agreement with regard to her sentence, which she also argues is harsh and excessive. Given that defendant has completed her consecutive one-year jail sentences during the pendency of this appeal, these claims related to sentencing are moot (see People v Rodwell, 122 AD3d 1065, 1068 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1170 [2015]; People v Pozzi, 117 AD3d 1325, 1325 [2014]; People v Trombley, 111 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2013]).\nEgan Jr., Rose and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\n.

County Court consolidated the indictments, and defendant was released on bail with a Parker admonishment advising him of the consequences of failing to appear for trial. At 10:45 a.m. on March 25, 2002, the day of trial, defendant told counsel that he was going to get something to eat. and would meet him at the courthouse before noon, the time that trial was scheduled to begin. Defendant did not appear, trial was delayed until the next day, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. After attempts to reach defendant failed and an investigation revealed that defendant had informed a family member that he was not going to appear in court, County Court determined that defendant waived his right to be present. Following a jury trial conducted in absentia, defendant was found guilty as charged and sentenced\u2014again in absentia inasmuch as defendant continued to secrete himself despite multiple adjournments and a diligent search for him by the Sheriffs Department and United States Marshals Service\u2014to 12 to 36 years in prison.\nDefendant next appeared more than six years later when he was arrested in November 2008 and remanded to the custody of the sheriff to serve his sentence. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20, asserting that (1) the sentence was illegal under the subsequently enacted Rockefeller Drug Reform Act, (2) invalid because he never admitted that he knew of his trial date, and (3) harsh and excessive. County Court denied the motion without a hearing, and defendant appeals from the judgment and the denial of his CPL 440.20 motion.\nDefendant\u2019s apipeal from the May 29, 2002 judgment of conviction must be dismissed inasmuch as the appeal was not timely taken and there is no basis for an extension under the circumstances presented herein (see CPL 460.10 [1] [a]; 460.30 [1]; People v Torres, 179 AD2d 358 [1992]; People v Doyne, 178 AD2d 870, 871 [1991]; cf.

To the extent that defendant argues, in connection with his CPL 440.20 motion, that he was improperly sentenced in absentia, his argument is unsupported by the record. Defendant concedes that his sentence is otherwise legal, and his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive may not be raised on a CPL 440.20 motion (see People v Boyce, 12 AD3d 728, 730 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 741 [2004]; People v Cunningham, 305 AD2d 516, 517 [2003]; see also People v Murphy, 37 AD3d 976, 977 [2007]).\nPeters, Spain, Rose and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

Additionally, the court affirmed the denial of the defendant's 2009 motion to vacate his sentence, ruling that his sentencing in absentia was valid and that claims regarding the harshness of the sentence could not be addressed through the motion.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant agreed to plead guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [4]), in full satisfaction of the indictment. As part of the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and executed a written waiver to that effect. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of incarceration of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, as well as by his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]; People v Kalenak, 2 AD3d 902, 902 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 629 [2004]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable because defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]; People v Kelly, supra at 789; People v Kalenak, supra at 902; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]). Defendant\u2019s claim that County Court\u2019s allocution was inadequate because defendant provided little more than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses is without merit. The record shows that defendant\u2019s affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s questions established the elements of the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty (see People v Goodell, 13 AD3d 816, 817 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]; People v Kemp, supra at 636).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s overall poof performance is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal inasmuch as the ineffectiveness alleged does not bear upon the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 803 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004]; People v Watkins, 304 AD2d 987, 987-988 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 588 [2003]). In any event, defendant \u201creceive [d] an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentence is likewise barred by his voluntary waiver of appeal, and we find no basis on this record to conclude that said waiver should not be honored (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

The court found that the defendant's challenges regarding the sufficiency of the plea allocution and the effectiveness of counsel were precluded by his waiver, and no inconsistencies in his plea were noted. Additionally, the court determined that the sentence imposed was not subject to challenge due to the voluntary nature of the appeal waiver.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed. Further, defendant\u2019s plea was taken in satisfaction of all other charges then pending against him in Broome County.

Defendant now appeals contending that his guilty plea was not entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently because he was not conversant with the English language. Alternatively, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nInitially, we note that upon a prior appeal to this Court, we determined that despite defendant\u2019s failure to move to vacate the judgment or withdraw his guilty plea, the assignment of new counsel was warranted to address nonfrivolous appealable issues regarding the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea (see, People v Serna, 262 AD2d 673). Nevertheless, upon our review of the merits, we are unpersuaded that these issues require reversal as an exercise of our discretion in the interest of justice. A transcript of the plea proceedings reveals that defendant capably responded, in English, to the questions put to him, giving no indication that he was having difficulty understanding the proceedings such as would have alerted County Court to the need for an interpreter (see, People v Ramos, 26 NY2d 272, 275). Indeed, inasmuch as defendant stated on the record that he had conferred with his attorney, that he understood the ramifications of his plea and that he was entering his guilty plea freely and voluntarily, we find no basis for vacating the guilty plea (see, People v Espinal, 176 AD2d 417, 418). Finally, defendant\u2019s lack of criminal history notwithstanding, we see no reason to disturb the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v O\u2019Byrne, 262 AD2d 867, 868, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024).\nCardona, P.

Defendant appeals, contending that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was permitted to plead to a lesser crime than that with which he was originally charged and he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Williams, 238 AD2d 633, lv denied 90 NY2d 866).

Defendant contends that failure of the sentencing court in Tompkins County to order a medical examination to determine whether he was a narcotic addict and to consider committing him to custody as an alternative to sentencing him to jail requires remand for sentencing in accordance with sections 81.19 and 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The only purpose of such a medical examination is to determine whether a defendant is an addict. Where, as here, the court had a presentence probation report and an evaluation report of the Office of Drug Abuse Services articulating the defendant\u2019s addiction, and determines that a sentence to a penal institution is called for, there is no necessity for such an examination and literal compliance with sections 81.19 and 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law is not required (People v Cicale, 35 NY2d 661; People v Carter, 31 NY2d 964; People v Butts, 40 AD2d 637). In any event, defendant was not eligible to be sentenced to probation under the care of a State health facility since at the time of sentencing he was subject to an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment imposed by another court, which sentence had more than one year to run (Penal Law, \u00a7 65.00, subd 1, par [b]).

Five of those counts encompassed crimes allegedly committed by defendant. In satisfaction thereof, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to 4V2 years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. In exchange, defendant committed to providing \u201congoing cooperation\u201d with authorities in prosecuting a specified codefendant who was a major participant in the drug conspiracy. Thereafter, defendant refused to testify against this individual, only informing the People that there was \u201cno way\u201d he would testify against him. At sentencing and in regard to his failure to provide such testimony, defendant explained to County Court that he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like [he] had to testify to what [he had] admitted to\u201d when he pleaded guilty and that the codefendant was incarcerated on the same tier at the local correctional facility. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant as a second violent felony offender to an enhanced sentence of 7V2 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, defendant contends that County Court improperly enhanced his sentence because he was not expressly advised that the terms of the plea agreement included him having to testify against his codefendant. Although not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant has failed to preserve this claim as the record does not reveal that he raised it before County Court or made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Bucknor, 116 AD3d 1233, 1234 [2014]). Under the circumstances presented, we decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action inasmuch as the plea agreement that was articulated on the record required defendant\u2019s ongoing cooperation in prosecuting this specific code-fendant, which sufficiently encompassed the provision of testimony (compare People v Gabbidon, 96 AD3d 1235, 1235-1236 [2012]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]).\nDefendant further asserts that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea based upon the improper enhancement of his sentence. However, given the clear terms of the plea agreement, such motion would have been futile. The failure to pursue a motion that \u201chas little or no chance of success\u201d is not a basis for finding that counsel was ineffective (People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Thiel, 134 AD3d 1237, 1240 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1156 [2016]).\nLastly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Scott, 139 AD3d 1266 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1155 [2016]; People v Briggs, 138 AD3d 1355, 1357 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Clark and Aarons, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nAt no point did defendant seek to be moved to a different tier. Moreover, defendant never stated that he would have been willing to testify had he been moved to a different tier or made any other similar statement that would have contradicted his earlier claim that there was \u201cno way\u201d that he would testify against the codefendant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County, which sentenced the defendant to 7.5 years in prison for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance after he failed to provide testimony against a codefendant as required by his plea agreement. The defendant's claims regarding improper sentence enhancement and ineffective assistance of counsel were rejected, as he did not preserve these arguments for appeal and had validly waived his right to appeal. The court noted that the plea agreement clearly included the requirement of ongoing cooperation, which encompassed providing testimony.<|eot_id|>"}

In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the trier of fact, which saw and heard the witnesses (see People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94 [1903]).

Defendant moved to suppress this evidence, but before a suppression hearing could be held, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant, a second felony offender, was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review because defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Barnes, 302 AD2d 623, 623 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]; People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617 [1999]). In any event, County Court conducted a thorough plea colloquy, ascertaining that defendant was thinking clearly, was not under duress and understood the nature and consequences of his guilty plea. Further, defendant admitted committing acts satisfying each element of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is predicated on counsel\u2019s failure to make certain pretrial motions and allegedly deficient discussions with defendant. Notably, defendant did not make a CPL 440.10 motion by which a record of counsel\u2019s preparations and client consultations could have been developed (see People v Jones, 55 NY2d 771, 773 [1981]; People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810, 811 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 675 [2002]; People v Paige, 289 AD2d 872, 873 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 759 [2002]). Further, counsel\u2019s failure to make a particular pretrial motion does not, in itself, constitute ineffective assistance (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Rodriguez, 303 AD2d 783, 785-786 [2003]; People v Paige, supra). Viewing the totality of the circumstance of this case, and in light of the favorable plea agreement and reduction in defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure, we conclude that counsel provided meaningful representation (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812 [1997], lv denied 92 NY2d 850 [1998]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be unavailing.\nSpain, J.P., Carpinello, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea.

Although the plastic bag storing the crack cocaine was retrieved from defendant\u2019s person, the crack cocaine was not. Following an unsuccessful attempt to suppress her statement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a pending indictment and waived her right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon prison term of seven years and postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant argues that defense counsel was ineffective at the Huntley hearing by failing to sufficiently explore the possibility that she was impaired by crack cocaine use at the time she made her statement. Assuming that this argument calls into question the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s guilty plea, her failure to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction leaves it unpreserved for our review (see People v Jenks, 69 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2010]; People v Cintron, 62 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 742 [2009]). Regardless, her argument fails on the merits. Defendant was examined at a hospital prior to making her statement, no other evidence in the record indicated that she was impaired, and defense counsel appropriately cross-examined the detective who obtained that statement regarding defendant\u2019s mental state (see People v Hayden, 250 AD2d 937, 939 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 879 [1998]; People v Leary, 145 AD2d 732, 734 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 1017 [1989]). Moreover, defendant expressed her satisfaction with counsel during the plea colloquy and indicated that she had discussed potential defenses in the case with him (see People v Cintron, 62 AD3d at 1158).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Lahtinen and Malone Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nWe note that defendant\u2019s appeal waiver expressly permits her to raise ineffective assistance issues upon appeal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following her guilty plea. The defendant argued ineffective assistance of counsel during the suppression hearing, claiming her statement to police was involuntary due to impairment from crack cocaine; however, this argument was deemed unpreserved for review as she did not move to withdraw her plea. The court found no evidence of impairment at the time of her statement, and the defendant had expressed satisfaction with her counsel during the plea process.<|eot_id|>"}

At the time of the sentencing, when defendant was asked if there was any legal cause to show why he should not be sentenced, his counsel stated that defendant was a drug addict, that he did not know if defendant had been investigated concerning narcotics, but that he wanted to inform the court of the situation. The court also had before it a probation report recommending such an examination. Section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides in part that \u201cEvery person * * * who, while in custody or when he appears before -the court, shall state, indicate or show symptoms, or it otherwise appears, that he is a narcotic addict, shall undergo a medical examination to determine whether he is a narcotic addict.\u201d However, the court disregarded the information about narcotics and sentenced defendant without a medical examination. An examination and finding concerning defendant\u2019s status as an addict is required, and he should be regentenced in accordance with the procedures mandated by sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law.

In connection with his plea, defendant was to be sentenced to five years of probation \u2014 provided he first complied with the terms of a one-year period of interim probation supervision. Failure to abide by the enumerated terms and conditions of such probation would expose defendant to a prison term of up to 2h years.\nLess than one year later, defendant was charged in a 12-count indictment with various drug-related offenses and, in full satisfaction thereof, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the underlying plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years and a period of postrelease supervision. Based upon that same conduct, defendant was found to have violated the terms of his interim probation and was sentenced to 2V2 years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision, said sentence to run consecutively to the sentences imposed upon the indicted charges. These appeals by defendant ensued.\nWe affirm. Although County Court attempted to impose consecutive periods of postrelease supervision, \u201cthe periods of post-release supervision imposed [up]on [defendant\u2019s] consecutive terms of imprisonment \u2018shall merge with and be satisfied by discharge of the period of post[ ]release supervision having the longest unexpired time to run\u2019 \u201d (People v VanValkinburgh, 90 AD3d 1553, 1554 [2011], quoting Penal Law \u00a7 70.45 [5] [c]; see People v Nelson, 46 AD3d 932, 933 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008]; People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 732 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]) \u2014 here, two years. Accordingly, we need not remit for clarification or other corrective action (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d at 732).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of his respective waivers of the right to appeal is similarly unavailing, as the record reflects that County Court adequately explained the nature of the rights being forfeited and defendant executed detailed written waivers in open court (see People v Revette, 102 AD3d 1065, 1065 [2013]). Having validly waived his right to appeal his convictions and sentences, defendant is precluded from now arguing that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive (see People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012]).\nNor are we persuaded that defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea to the superior court information because restitution was not part of the underlying plea agreement (see generally People v Gantt, 63 AD3d 1379, 1379-1380 [2009]). Notwithstanding the limitations otherwise imposed by CPL 430.10, \u201c[a] court has the inherent power to correct its mistake in sentencing a defendant where the mistake is clear from the record and the correction fully comports with the expectations of the parties at the time of sentencing\u201d (People v Jackson, 59 AD3d 971, 972 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 854 [2009]; see People v Richardson, 100 NY2d 847, 850-851 [2003]). Here, it is apparent that County Court simply misspoke when it initially ordered restitution with respect to defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and, upon realizing its error, the court verified that \u201cthere was no restitution [awarded] in this matter\u201d and directed that an amended sentence and commitment order be issued omitting any reference thereto. County Court\u2019s clarification in this regard was entirely permissible and, therefore, defendant\u2019s argument on this point must fail. Defendant\u2019s related challenge to the imposition of the statutory surcharge also is unpersuasive, as \u201cwe do not require that a defendant be advised, prior to his or her plea, that the statutory surcharge is a part of the sentence\u201d (People v Fauntleroy, 57 AD3d 1167, 1168 [2008] [internal quota tion marks and citation omitted]).

The court clarified that periods of postrelease supervision would merge, and the defendant's additional challenges were deemed without merit.<|eot_id|>"}

In exchange, it was agreed that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 2\u00bd to 7\u00bdyears. Defendant executed both a written waiver of his right to appeal and a Parker admonishment, wherein he acknowledged that his participation in any illegal conduct during the period of time between the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing would free County Court to impose any legal sentence, including the maximum sentence permitted by law (see People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141 [1982]). When defendant perpetrated the crime of bail jumping by failing to appear at his scheduled sentencing hearing, County Court sentenced him in absentia to an enhanced prison term of 5 to 15 years, a legal sentence (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]).\nDefendant appeals the imposition of an enhanced sentence on the ground that County Court neglected to inform him at the plea hearing of the maximum sentence which could be imposed in the event that he failed to appear at the sentencing hearing. County Court advised defendant that if he failed to appear for sentencing, he \u201ccould be sentenced to any legal sentence upon conviction for a Class B felony, which is substantially greater exposure than 7\u00bd years.\u201d Defendant stated that he understood and defense counsel advised the court that he had discussed with defendant what that exposure would be, a fact confirmed by defendant\u2019s written waiver of appeal. As a result, not only is defendant\u2019s argument belied by the record, but the issue raised does not challenge the legality of the sentence and is, therefore, precluded by his waiver (see People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 791 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 833 [2000]).\nAs defendant was adequately advised concerning the maximum sentence that could be imposed, we decline to review his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733 [1998]; People v Fewell [Sawyer], 284 AD2d 563 [2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 681, 687 [2001]). Moreover, as defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel does not allege that the inadequacy of counsel affected the voluntary nature of his plea (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]), this claim is also precluded by his waiver. The remaining issues raised by defendant have been examined and found to be without merit.\nCrew III, J.P., Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Under the terms of the negotiated plea agreement, the defendant was promised that if he appeared for sentencing, he could withdraw his plea and waive the indictment, the indictment would be dismissed, a Superior Court Information would be filed, and he would be able to plead to a class E felony and receive a sentence of one and one-half to three years imprisonment. On the other hand, if he failed to appear for sentencing, the court stated that it would impose a sentence of up to 25 years on the defendant\u2019s plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in the indictment. As the defendant did not appear for sentencing, the waiver of indictment was never executed, and he was sentenced, upon his plea, to four and one-half to nine years imprisonment.\nIt is true that the procedure contemplated by the plea agreement violated CPL 195.10 (2) (b), in that a waiver of indictment is not permitted once the indictment has been filed, and also amounted to an unauthorized reduction in charges under CPL 220.10 (5) (a) (ii) (see, People v Boston, 75 NY2d 585; People v Banville, 134 AD2d 116). However, the record indicates that the illegal plea agreement was never fulfilled, and indeed, was nullified, due to the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at sentencing. The court clearly advised the defendant during the plea proceeding that if he did not appear for sentencing, he would be sentenced on his plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in the indictment, to a term of up to 25 years imprisonment. Under these circumstances, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed (see, People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917, 918; People v Warren, 121 AD2d 418). Mangano, P.

In accordance with the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 8 Vs years to life.

Defendant now appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was illegal.\nPreliminarily, defendant\u2019s valid waiver of his right to appeal does not foreclose his present challenge to the legality of his sentence (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Turning to the merits, although not entirely clear from the record, it appears that defendant had at least two prior felony convictions at the time of sentencing\u2014 one for assault in the second degree and one for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant admitted both prior felony convictions, but the CPL 400.21 statement filed by the People referenced only the conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As defendant correctly notes, it is not clear from the sentencing minutes which of the two prior felony convictions County Court utilized as the predicate felony in imposing sentence. The record does, however, reflect that County Court stated that it sentenced defendant as a second felony offender pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.06.\nPenal Law \u00a7 70.06 does not provide for the imposition of a determinate sentence; any sentence imposed thereunder must be an indeterminate sentence (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [2], [3], [4]), with a maximum term of no less than three years and no more than four years and a minimum of one half of the maximum term. Having been convicted of a felony defined in Penal Law article 220, defendant was required to be sentenced in accordance with Penal Law \u00a7 70.70, which mandates that the sentence for either a felony drug offender or a second felony drug offender be a determinate sentence. Had defendant been properly sentenced under this statute, he would have received\u2014 depending upon the predicate felony employed\u2014a determinate sentence of either IV2 years as a felony drug offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [a] [iv]) or two years as a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [iv]), followed by the appropriate period of postrelease supervision. Although defendant did admit to County Court that he was previously convicted of the drug felony described in the CPL 400.21 statement filed by the People, the court stated twice at sentencing that defendant was being sentenced to the minimum of two years of imprisonment because defendant had a prior violent felony conviction.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County, rendered September 10, 1975, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of bail jumping in the first degree and from a judgment of the same court, rendered September 26, 1975, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant, after arraignment in Ithaca City Court on drug possession charges, jumped bail. While at large he was indicted for bail jumping in the first degree and, by separate indictment, charged with three drug charges, including possession of heroin with intent to sell. (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.16, subd 1.) He was arrested and convicted after jury trial of bail jumping in the first degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 215.57). Thereafter, but prior to sentencing on the bail jumping conviction, he entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and, after lengthy plea bargaining, was sentenced to four years to life on the drug charge and to an indeterminate sentence not to exceed four years on the bail jumping conviction, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appeals from the judgment of September 26, 1975 sentencing him to four years to life upon his plea of guilty to the class A felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree on the ground that he did not freely and voluntarily enter his plea of guilty. A review of the record reveals evidence of extensive plea bargaining between the District Attorney\u2019s ofiiee and counsel for defendant, culminating in a letter from the District Attorney to defendant\u2019s lawyer advising that the People, at sentencing, would recommend the minimum sentence for a class A-III felony. At sentencing, the People fulfilled their promise, but the court advised defendant that the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation was not binding on it and that a sentence appropriate to the crime would be imposed after a consideration of all relevant factors, including a presentencing probation report. The defendant replied that he understood. Extensive dialogue followed concerning the alternate sentences authorized by statute and defendant indicated that he was aware of and appreciated the distinctions. The Court of Appeals in People v Francis {38 NY2d 150, 153, 154) set forth the circumstances that might alert a Judge to the fact that a defendant\u2019s plea is inappropriate. None of those facts are present herein (see People v Hayes, 55 AD2d 691). Next, there is no requirement that a Judge conduct a pro forma inquisition in each case to determine if a defendant, adequately represented by counsel, and who admits the underlying facts, as here, may nevertheless not know what he is doing (cf. People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338). Something must trigger such an inquiry (People v Francis, supra). A plea is a bargain struck between a defendant and a prosecutor, both of whom may be in doubt as to a trial\u2019s outcome, and where, as here, the court which accepts the plea has no reason to believe it is unfair or inappropriate, the bargain becomes final (p 156). Since the sentence imposed on the drug conviction was not excessive (cf. People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861) and no grounds attacking the bail jumping conviction are raised on appeal, the judgments should be affirmed. Judgments affirmed. Koreman, P. J., Sweeney, Kane, Mahoney and Main, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed two judgments from the County Court of Tompkins County, one for bail jumping in the first degree and the other for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. After jumping bail on drug charges, he was convicted of bail jumping and later pled guilty to drug possession, receiving concurrent sentences. The appeal contended that the guilty plea was not entered voluntarily, but the court found no evidence of coercion or unfairness in the plea process, ultimately affirming both judgments.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant was subsequently indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Upon arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty, and the People announced their readiness for trial and requested that the indictment be transferred to the trial calendar.\nThereafter, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds (see CPL 30.30), which motion was denied. Defendant then pleaded guilty in accordance with a negotiated plea agreement to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of 472 to 9 years and waived his right to appeal.\nDefendant claims that he was deprived of his right to a speedy trial pursuant to the provisions of CPL 30.30 apparently on the ground that at the time the People declared their readiness (clearly within the statute\u2019s time constraints), laboratory results had not been received and the People therefore could not have been ready to proceed. As we previously have observed, the lack of a laboratory report is not required to support an indictment. \u201cThus, it necessarily follows that the lack of such a report would not mandate a trial order of dismissal since the standard for judging the legal sufficiency of evidence before a grand jury is the same as that for judging a motion for a trial order of dismissal\u201d (People v Van Hoesen, 12 AD3d 5, 8 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 804 [2005] [citations omitted]). Thus, the fact that formal laboratory results are not obtained by the People prior to the expiration of the statutory speedy trial period does not require a finding, that the statement of readiness was illusory (see People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888, 890 [2005]).\nWe likewise reject defendant\u2019s contention that his plea was not voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently made. The record makes plain that defendant was fully advised of the consequences of his plea, including those rights he would be waiving, and that such plea was knowingly and voluntarily made. Throughout the plea allocution, defendant indicated that he understood County Court\u2019s admonitions, that he wished to plead guilty and that he was not coerced or threatened into doing so.\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The principal basis for defendant\u2019s contention is that defense counsel was guilty of gross negligence in encouraging defendant to accept the plea offer. Defense counsel\u2019s conduct in encouraging defendant to accept the plea bargain here was nothing more than the product of reasonable and legitimate strategy in the best interest of defendant. Indeed, defendant was well advised by counsel to plead guilty and avoid a trial, considering the likelihood that the People would have been able to secure a conviction and defendant\u2019s sentence thereon would have been considerably harsher than that to which he agreed.\nFinally, with regard to defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we decline to address the issue. While it is clear that we have the authority to review such a claim in the interest of justice, defendant\u2019s decision to waive his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement represents his decision to foreclose review of the sentence (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]). We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.\nPeters, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance following his guilty plea. The court rejected the defendant's claims regarding a violation of his right to a speedy trial, the voluntariness of his plea, and the effectiveness of his counsel, finding that he was adequately informed and advised during the plea process. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant's waiver of his right to appeal precluded review of his sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant waived indictment and consented to prosecution by Superior Court information (CPL 195.10). On October 26, 1983, after plea bargaining, defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree in satisfaction of all charges. At that time the District Attorney stated that \u201cat the time of sentence the district attorney\u2019s office would not ask for time but that we would ask that the court follow the recommendations of the Franklin County Probation Department\u201d. At that proceeding, the trial court explained the ramifications of defendant\u2019s plea and specifically advised him that the sentence could be up to seven years. The court further advised defendant that: \u201calthough the district attorney will not be asking that you receive time at the time of sentencing, that is not binding upon this court and that the court can sentence you to any of the sentences that I previously informed you of.\u201d Defendant, on that occasion, conceded that no one had promised any specific sentence.\nAfter receiving the probation department\u2019s presentence report which recommended a jail sentence, the trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence of incarceration with a minimum of two years and a maximum of six years. At the sentencing, there was no objection by defendant nor was there a motion to withdraw his plea.\nOn appeal, defendant appears to contend that there was an agreement that in exchange for his plea of guilty to a reduced charge he would not receive a sentence requiring his incarceration. However, the record is manifestly clear that no such agreement took place. The trial court specifically advised defendant that it would discharge its responsibility to sentence defendant in accordance with any of its prerogatives in spite of the fact that the prosecution would not urge incarceration. It is equally clear that the prosecutor stated that, although he would not independently recommend incarceration, he would urge the trial court to follow the recommendation of the probation department. The probation department recommended incarceration and the prosecutor did not make any recommendation at the sentencting.\nWell-established law is that a sentence for a criminal action is solely within the discretion of the court (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 308). Even though the People and defendant agree to a sentence, the agreement is not binding upon the court (People v Thompson, 91 AD2d 672, mod 60 NY2d 513). In this instance, there was no agreement. The trial court carefully, fairly and fully advised defendant of the consequences of his plea and properly accepted his plea (People v Burgos, 88 AD2d 727).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention is that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. Defendant has a record of prior convictions including two felony convictions. He has two convictions relating to controlled substances. We find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by the trial court.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Casey, Weiss, Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Franklin County affirmed a judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, following a guilty plea as part of a plea bargain. Despite the defendant's claim that he was promised no incarceration in exchange for his plea, the court clarified that it retained the discretion to impose a sentence regardless of the prosecutor's recommendation. The trial court ultimately sentenced the defendant to an indeterminate term of two to six years in prison, which the appellate court found to be within the court\u2019s discretion and not unduly harsh given the defendant's criminal history.<|eot_id|>"}

The record reveals that prior to trial the court conveyed to the defendant an offer of the District Attorney to recommend the minimum sentence for this felony of one year to life if he pleaded guilty. The court indicated that if the defendant offered to so plead guilty, the court would thereafter permit a withdrawal of the plea if it should find that a more severe sentence should be imposed. The defendant rejected the offer but now contends that the sentence of a minimum of four years to life is too severe. The record does not establish that the court imposed the sentence because the defendant went to trial, but instead that it was based upon the entire case as presided over by the Trial Judge and upon a presentence report.

In January 2002, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment charging that crime and a lesser count. Sentencing was adjourned to allow defendant to assist the authorities with additional criminal investigations. In April 2003, defense counsel moved to withdraw, alleging a conflict of interest in that seven or eight months earlier he was retained to represent an individual who, unbeknownst to counsel at that time, was the subject of a criminal investigation with which defendant was cooperating. After defense counsel was relieved, new defense counsel moved to withdraw defendant\u2019s plea alleging that previous counsel was ineffective due to his conflicted representation and that he misled defendant by advising him that his cooperation could result in a sentence of time served. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant to a prison term of 15 years to life. Defendant appeals, asserting that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea. We disagree.\nUpon review of the record, we discern no basis to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s application to withdraw his guilty plea (see People v Leonard, 25 AD3d 925, 926 [2006]; People v Marshall, 13 AD3d 801, 802 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 888 [2005]). Defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unavailing inasmuch as the record reveals that his attorney did not represent the individual against whom he was cooperating until at least eight months after defendant pleaded guilty. Consequently, defendant does not and cannot point to any facts demonstrating that \u201c \u2018the conduct of his defense was in fact affected by the operation of the conflict of interest,\u2019 or that the conflict \u2018operated on\u2019 the representation\u201d (People v Ortiz, 76 NY2d 652, 657 [1990], quoting People v Alicea, 61 NY2d 23, 31 [1983]; see People v Harris, 99 NY2d 202, 210 [2002]).\nDefendant\u2019s contention that he was induced into pleading guilty by the promise of a sentence of time served is belied by the record evidence, which establishes that, prior , to pleading guilty, defendant consulted with counsel and expressed his satisfaction with his services, was fully apprised of and understood his rights, ensured that he was pleading guilty of his own free will and not in exchange for any promises other than those laid out on the record, and acknowledged that, pursuant to the plea agreement, his sentence would be no greater than 16 years to life. Defendant then freely admitted his guilt and the facts underlying the crime. Significantly, although defendant alleges in his motion affidavit that counsel advised him on numerous occasions that as a result of his cooperation his sentence would be reduced to time served, defendant does not allege that counsel made such a representation to him prior to the plea. Without any allegations of such facts, County Court was not required to grant defendant a hearing on his motion. Under the circumstances, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation at the time of his plea and entered his guilty plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see People v Bolden, 14 AD3d 934, 935 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 796 [2005]).\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Spain and Rose, JJ., concur.

The appellate court found no evidence of ineffective representation and determined that the defendant entered his plea voluntarily and with a clear understanding of his rights.<|eot_id|>"}

As part of the negotiated plea bargain, he executed a written waiver of his right to appeal and he received a sentence, as a second felony offender, of 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s argument that his waiver of appeal was the product of coercion was not properly preserved for review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Kirkland, 2 AD3d 1063, 1063 [2003]; People v Holland, 270 AD2d 718, 718 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 798 [2000]). Even if we were to consider the argument, we would find it unpersuasive since the record reveals that defendant executed a detailed written waiver acknowledging his right to appeal, relating that he had discussed his appellate options with his attorney and stating that he was waiving his right to appeal voluntarily (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Bronson, 28 AD3d 936, 937 [2006]). While defendant expressed disappointment with his attorney, there was no showing of ineffectiveness (see generally People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 113-114 [2003]) and no factual basis upon which to conclude that he was coerced to take the plea because of less than adequate representation by counsel. Indeed, counsel was able to negotiate a favorable deal in a case where defendant faced a potential life sentence if convicted.\nWe decline to address the remaining contentions in light of the effective appeal waiver.\nCrew III, J.E, Carpinello, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

The agreement was conditioned upon defendant\u2019s appearance at the sentencing hearing before County Court and his abstention from additional criminal activity during the interim. Prior to sentencing, defendant was again arrested on a drug-related charge. As a result, he accepted the terms of a revised agreement pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 to 7 years, and his most recent drug-related charge, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was dismissed. Defendant appeals, seeking a reduction of his sentence in the interest of justice.\nIn view of defendant\u2019s lengthy history of drug-related crimes and his apparent inability to refrain from this activity, we find that the prison term imposed by County Court was appropriate (see People v Hill, 291 AD2d 730; People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917). Defendant\u2019s admitted drug addiction and need for rehabilitation do not constitute extraordinary circumstances that would warrant modification of his sentence in the interest of justice, given the opportunities he has received to participate in drug rehabilitation programs and his repeated failure to benefit from them (see People v Baker, 293 AD2d 820, 822, lv denied 98 NY2d 708).

As part of the plea bargain, County Court made a commitment to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of no longer than 10 years to life.

An agreement was subsequently reached whereby defendant would plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony, and receive a sentence of 2 to 4 years in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services under the Willard Drug Treatment program in Seneca County. Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing. County Court, however, specifically advised him that if he did not appear for sentencing, he would not receive the promised sentence and he could be sentenced in absentia to the maximum for a class D felony. After defendant failed to appear for sentencing on four different occasions, County Court sentenced him in absentia as a second felony offender to 3x/2 to 7 years in prison. He now appeals.\nWe affirm. Given that defendant violated the terms of his release by repeatedly failing to appear for sentencing with full knowledge of the consequences thereof, County Court was justified in imposing the enhanced sentence. In view of this, as well as defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, we do not find that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice or that County Court abused its discretion (see People v Ramsey, 269 AD2d 616, 617 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 951 [2000]; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, 880 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 879 [2000]).

Initially agreeing to a lighter sentence under a plea deal, he was ultimately sentenced in absentia to a longer term as a second felony offender. The court affirmed the sentence, finding no abuse of discretion given the defendant's repeated violations and prior criminal history, dismissing his drug addiction and prior incarceration as factors warranting a sentence reduction.<|eot_id|>"}

The defendant accepted a plea agreement which permitted him to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment. In exchange for his guilty plea, the defendant was promised a sentence of six years to life imprisonment.\nAt sentencing the County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of imprisonment and the defendant subsequently moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, on the grounds of \"newly-discovered evidence\u201d, i.e., that the Dutchess County Drug Task Force was not a legally-authorized organization at the time of its operations against the defendant, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The County Court denied the motion. The defendant has been granted permission to appeal from this order.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel\u2019s failure to argue that the Dutchess County Drug Task Force was not a legally-authorized organization at the time of its operations against the defendant on April 6, 1989, is without merit. We find that since the Task Force members are police officers from participating municipalities they had the authority to secure a warrant and arrest the defendant based upon his illegal drug activity despite the fact that the agreement authorizing the Task Force was not executed until July 20, 1989 (see, People v Martin, 163 AD2d 536). Having determined that members of the Dutchess County Drug Task Force had the authority to act prior to July 20, 1989, the defendant\u2019s allegation that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based upon his court-appointed attorney\u2019s failure to raise that issue must fail. Moreover, we find that the defendant has made no factual showing whatsoever to dispel the inference of effective representation arising from the highly favorable plea agreement his counsel negotiated (see, People v St. John, 163 AD2d 687).\nThe defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was imposed in accordance with the plea agreement and we find no basis for modifying it on appeal (see, People v Kazespis, 101 AD2d 816).\nWe have considered the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his supplemental pro se brief, and find them to be without merit.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered October 28, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was charged in a two-count indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. On July 8, 1992, prior to the conclusion of a hearing to suppress physical evidence, defendant entered a counseled plea of guilty to the first count charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. The plea was conditioned upon County Court\u2019s promise that should he appear for sentencing on August 17, 1992 and enter a plea of guilty under the second count to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony, he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to the statutory minimum of 3 to 6 years in prison and his guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree would be vacated. As a further condition of the plea, defendant also agreed to withdraw all motions previously filed.\nOn August 17, 1992, defendant appeared in County Court represented by new counsel who had filed a motion on defendant\u2019s behalf to withdraw his guilty plea. The proceedings were adjourned to October 27, 1992. On October 27, 1992, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and adjourned the matter to the following day to give defendant an opportunity to confer with his attorney in order to determine if he wished to proceed in accordance with the negotiated plea disposition of July 8, 1992. On October 28, 1992, in response to the court\u2019s further inquiry as to how he wished to proceed, defendant stated that he was \"staying mute\u201d. County Court then proceeded to sentence defendant to 4 Vi to 9 years in prison, the statutory minimum for a predicate felon convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06). Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that County Court abused its discretion by denying his application to withdraw his plea. Here, the record confirms that \"the plea was knowing and voluntary and was made without the protestation of innocence\u201d (see, People v Collins, 186 AD2d 298; People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, 884-886, lv denied 75 NY2d 921). Furthermore, \"[a] sentencing court need not permit a defendant to withdraw a plea where, as here, the defendant himself has failed to fulfill an explicit condition underlying the sentence agreement\u201d (People v McDaniels, 111 AD2d 876, 877; see, People v Scott, 196 AD2d 921; People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841). One of the clear and unequivocal conditions of the court\u2019s promise to sentence defendant to 3 to 6 years was defendant\u2019s entry of a plea to the lesser offense of attempted possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant\u2019s failure to fulfill this condition, despite the court\u2019s meticulous explanation of the sentencing consequences should he fail to enter a plea to the class C felony, left County Court with the discretion to impose whatever legal sentence it felt was appropriate under the circumstances (see, People v Scott, supra). As previously noted, defendant\u2019s sentence was the minimum authorized by law.\nAdditionally, by agreeing to withdraw all outstanding motions and entering his guilty plea before a decision was rendered on his suppression motion, defendant forfeited appellate review of the suppression issues which he seeks to raise on this appeal (see, People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686; People v Clark, 197 AD2d 531, lv denied 82 NY2d 892).\nWe have considered the remaining contentions raised by defendant\u2019s assigned counsel and by defendant\u2019s supplementary brief and find them to be lacking in merit.\nMikoll, Mercure, White and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Broome County, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea.

Additionally, by withdrawing all motions and entering the plea, the defendant forfeited the right to appeal issues related to the suppression of evidence.<|eot_id|>"}

This issue, however, has not been preserved for our review because defendant did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Thomas, 307 AD2d 592, 592 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 625 [2003]; People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914, 915 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 580 [2003]). Although defendant was initially hesitant to accept the negotiated plea agreement, County Court properly made further and repeated inquiries to ensure that defendant understood the nature of the charge and that the plea was intelligently and voluntarily entered and, thus, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]).\nIn any event, considering defendant\u2019s claim, we find it to be without merit. The transcript of the plea proceedings discloses, that County Court went to great lengths to explain to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, taking special care to specifically address those matters about which defendant initially expressed confusion. After the court clarified these matters, defendant indicated that he understood them and conferred with counsel. While defendant initially professed ignorance of the cir cumstances of the crime, he ultimately admitted that he sold cocaine in Ulster County in August 1999. As the record makes clear, \u201c[a]ny reluctance on the part of defendant in entering his guilty plea is attributable not to threats or coercion but to defendant\u2019s \u2018unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation\u2019 \u201d (People v Wilmer, 191 AD2d 850, 850-851 [1993], lv denied 81 NY2d 1022 [1993], quoting People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840 [1992], lv denied 79 NY2d 949 [1992]; see People v Evans, 193 AD2d 960, 961 [1993]).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur.

Consequently, the court affirmed the judgment, determining that the defendant's reluctance was due to dissatisfaction with his situation rather than coercion.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to a plea agreement that included an appeal waiver, defendant entered a guilty plea under count 2 of the indictment to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, admitting that he had possessed morphine with intent to sell it. Consistent with that agreement, he was sentenced, as an admitted second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony, to a prison term of 11 years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal is valid. At the time of the waiver, defendant was 32 years old and had a criminal history that stretched back more than 12 years and that included a conviction for a violent felony (see generally People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]). During the colloquy with defendant, County Court elicited defendant\u2019s assurance that he understood that the \u201cright to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights . . . automatically forfeited by [the] plea of guilty.\u201d Defendant also assured the court that he understood that such a waiver would not affect his right to appeal on a number of grounds that the court had listed for him. More generally, defendant agreed that he understood the difference between those rights that he was giving up and those rights that he would retain in regard to a waiver of the right to appeal. This colloquy was sufficient to demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d at 341-342 [2015]; People v Handly, 122 AD3d 1007, 1008 [2014]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 969 [2014]; People v Wolz, 112 AD3d 1150, 1151-1152 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1026 [2014]).

Consequently, the court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the appeal concerning the harshness of the sentence could not be reviewed due to the valid waiver.<|eot_id|>"}

At sentencing, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a second felony offender, a sentence of four years in prison with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nInasmuch as defendant failed to object that the period of post-release supervision imposed at sentencing did not conform to the term indicated during the plea proceeding, his claim is unpreserved for our review (see People v Young, 85 AD3d 1489, 1491 [2011]; People v Davis, 79 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 797 [2011]).

Given these circumstances, we will exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction (see CPL 470.15 [6]) and modify the sentence imposed by sentencing defendant to the agreed-upon sentence of four years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision.

In view of this, and given defendant\u2019s criminal history and involvement in bringing large quantities of narcotic drugs into Washington County from New York City, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Aubrey, 73 AD3d 1393, 1394 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 893 [2011]; People v Murray, 58 AD3d 1073, 1076 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 786 [2009]; People v Martin, 52 AD3d 943 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 791 [2008]).\nSpain, J.E, Rose, Kavanagh, Stein and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to time served on one of the counts and five years of probation on the other. County Court, however, warned defendant that if he was arrested between the time of the plea and sentencing, it would not be bound by the agreement and could sentence him to up to four years on each count, to run consecutively. Defendant was arrested for petit larceny prior to sentencing and admitted that there was a reasonable basis for his arrest at a subsequent hearing. Consequently, County Court sentenced him to consecutive terms of imprisonment of three years on each count, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant urges this Court to modify his sentence in the interest of justice. We decline to do so in view of the circumstances. It is undisputed that defendant failed to comply with the terms of the plea agreement by getting arrested for petit larceny prior to sentencing. County Court conducted an appropriate inquiry and determined that there was a reasonable basis for defendant\u2019s arrest (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Jenkins, 40 AD3d 1308 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 991 [2007]; compare People v Davis, 62 AD3d 1266, 1267 [2009]). Consequently, County Court was not obligated to adhere to the original sentence. Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the record discloses that County Court based the new sentence on defendant\u2019s postplea arrest, not his misdeeds while a confidential informant. In view of defendant\u2019s considerable criminal record and status as a second felony offender, we find no extraordi nary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see generally People v Rose, 79 AD3d 1365, 1367 [2010]; People v Dilone, 261 AD2d 650 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 969 [1999]).\nPeters, J.P, Lahtinen, Malone Jr., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur.

Although defendant failed to appear at his first scheduled sentencing allegedly due to a seizure, he nevertheless was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 3 to 6 years at a subsequently rescheduled sentencing.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that his physical condition, allegedly resulting from a seizure a month earlier, impaired his ability to understand the sentencing proceeding. On the contrary, the record establishes that defendant\u2019s behavior at sentencing was appropriate. Defendant duly responded to County Court\u2019s inquiry regarding his status as a second felony offender and also advocated for a more lenient sentence. In view of the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s failure to order a competency hearing (see, People v Planty, 238 AD2d 806, 807, lv denied 89 NY2d 1098).

Less than three months later, defendant was arrested in New York City on a drug sale charge and, in June 1999, he entered a plea of guilty of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, on which a prison sentence of 3 to 6 years was imposed. The plea also apparently encompassed another drug sale charge that had been pending since May 1998 and predated defendant\u2019s initial arrest in Sullivan County. Defendant received a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years on that earlier charge. Based on the conviction arising out of conduct committed while on probation, defendant was found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. County Court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to the maximum possible prison term of 5 to 15 years to run consecutively to the sentences imposed upon the other convictions. Defendant appeals, claiming that the sentence is harsh and excessive.\nIn light of defendant\u2019s three drug-related convictions for conduct committed over a period of less than one year, with the most recent drug sale occurring less than three months after County Court had placed him on probation, a lengthy sentence was warranted and we see no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s imposition of the maximum possible term of 5 to 15 years. While imposition of the maximum prison term can be justified by the record, the added effect of consecutive sentencing strikes us as excessive. Defendant does not have an extensive criminal record over a lengthy period and there is no evidence that his involvement in the drug-related activity was anything other than recent and short term. Nor does the record reveal anything in the nature of the crimes that would warrant the added effect of consecutive sentencing. There is no indication of violence or the presence of weapons and there is nothing to suggest that defendant\u2019s involvement in the sale of drugs was anything other than the lowest level. Based upon the record, we conclude that the consecutive nature of the sentence is unduly severe and, therefore, the judgment should be modified (see, People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908; People v Sturgis, 202 AD2d 808, 810, lv denied 84 NY2d 833).\nCardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the prison sentence imposed on defendant be served concurrently with any sentence previously imposed by any other court rather than consecutively, and, as so modified, affirmed.\nAlthough the Sullivan County indictment satisfied by his plea included a count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, the People candidly admitted at the original sentencing that dismissal of that count was required because of the lack of proof that defendant had any knowledge of the weight of the drugs found in the vehicle in which he was riding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court revoked the defendant's probation and sentenced him to 5 to 15 years in prison after he was found guilty of violating probation due to new drug-related convictions. While the court justified the lengthy sentence given the defendant's recent criminal activity, the appellate court found that the consecutive nature of the sentence was excessively severe, given the lack of violence and the defendant's limited criminal history. The judgment was modified to allow the prison sentence to run concurrently with any other sentences imposed.<|eot_id|>"}

In 2005, he was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, as well as violating the terms of his probation. A plea agreement was proposed and reviewed with defendant by County Court under which defendant would (1) plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and to violating the terms of his probation in satisfaction of the indictment, the violation petition and two pending misdemeanor charges, (2) be sentenced as a second felony offender to two years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, on the criminal possession charge and one year in jail on the probation violation, to run concurrently, and (3) waive his right to appeal. During the plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant of the maximum sentences that could be imposed for the crime and violation at issue and that the agreed-upon sentences would be honored only if defendant were not arrested or charged with another crime prior to sentencing. Defendant\u2019s guilty plea and admission to the violation petition were then accepted by County Court. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested and indicted for selling cocaine, which he admitted. Because defendant had violated the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him on the criminal possession charge to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and to a consecutive term of 1 to 3 years in prison on the probation violation. Defendant now appeals.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment to represent defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal.

Therefore, the judgment is affirmed and counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], Iv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).\nSpain, J.P, Carpinello, Rose, Kavanagh and Stein, JJ., concur.

In connection with the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court committed to a prison sentence of no more than eight years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant failed to appear for the initial sentencing date, prompting County Court to issue a bench warrant for his arrest. Upon defendant\u2019s appearance at the next scheduled date, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nAlthough defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary survives his waiver of the right to appeal, the record before us does not reflect that defendant preserved this argument for our review by making a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Musser, 106 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2013]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Nor does the record reveal any basis upon which the exception to the preservation requirement would be triggered, as nothing in the minutes of the plea proceeding casts doubt upon defendant\u2019s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2012]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2011] , lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]; People v Board, 75 AD3d 833, 833 [2010]). To the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument relates to the voluntariness of his plea, it also survives his waiver of the right to appeal, but is likewise unpreserved (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012] , lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v Benson, 100 AD3d at 1109; People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385). Finally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence is foreclosed by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853-854 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385).\nRose, J.P., Stein and Garry, JJ., concur.

Thereafter, he moved, inter alia, to dismiss that count of the indictment charging him with promoting prison contraband in the first degree or, alternatively, to reduce the charge to promoting prison contraband in the second degree. Following County Court\u2019s denial of the motion, defendant pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 3 to 6 years in prison consecutive to the sentence he was then serving. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, Penal Law \u00a7 205.25 provides that:\n\u201cA person is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree when: * * *\n\u201c2. Being a person confined in a detention facility, he knowingly and unlawfully makes, obtains or possesses any dangerous contraband.\u201d\nDefendant argues that because marihuana is not \u201cdangerous contraband\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 205.00 (4), the charge of promoting prison contraband in the first degree should have been reduced to promoting prison contraband in the second degree. We disagree. Penal Law \u00a7 205.00 (4) broadly defines dangerous contraband as any item capable of \u201cendanger [ing] the safety or security of a detention facility or any person therein.\u201d More than one appellate court has recognized that the use of illegal drugs by inmates in correctional facilities \u201ccan result in disruptive and dangerous behavior among the inmate population,\u201d thus providing a basis for the charge of promoting prison contraband in the first degree (People v Watson, 162 AD2d 1015, 1015, appeal dismissed 77 NY2d 857; see People v Rivera, 221 AD2d 380, Iv denied 87 NY2d 977). In light of these appellate decisions, defendant\u2019s reliance on People v Soto (77 Misc 2d 427) is misplaced. We have considered defendant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we find no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion.\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Spain and Rose, JJ., concur.

He pleaded guilty as charged, was sentenced to five years of probation and was ordered to forfeit the vehicle that was seized at the time of his arrest. Subsequently, he was charged in an amended indictment with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after police recovered additional drugs from his vehicle. Following County Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, defendant admitted that he had possessed cocaine in an amount exceeding one half of an ounce, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and waived his right to appeal as part of the negotiated plea agreement. He was then sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison and now appeals.\nInitially, defendant waived his constitutional double jeopardy claim by his express waiver of the right to appeal, which \u201cevidence [d] the understanding that, by taking the plea, [he] knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently gave up the right to appeal from all waivable aspects of the case\u201d (People v Muniz, 91 NY2d 570, 575 [1998]; see People v Almonte [Beano], 288 AD2d 632, 633 [2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 726, 727 [2002]). Even assuming that defendant\u2019s claim is properly before us, the prohibition against double jeopardy \u201cdo[es] not prevent successive prosecution of two offenses arising out of the same transaction where, as here, \u2018each of the offenses contains an element which the other does not\u2019 \u201d (Matter of Kelly v Bruhn, 3 AD3d 783, 784 [2004], lv dismissed 2 NY3d 793 [2004], quoting People v Wood, 95 NY2d 509, 513 [2000]). While defendant\u2019s previous conviction on his guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree required proof that he intended to sell the drugs (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.06 [1]), the instant charge required proof that the aggregate weight of the drugs are one half of an ounce or more (see Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [12]). Accordingly, double jeopardy posed no constitutional bar to defendant\u2019s current prosecution (see People v Lebron, 305 AD2d 799, 801 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 583 [2003]; People v Lanahan, 276 AD2d 906, 907-908 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 965 [2000]). Given defendant\u2019s voluntary, knowing and intelligent plea and his valid waiver of the right to appeal, we decline to review his remaining challenge to the severity of the agreed-upon sentence (see People v Keebler, 15 AD3d 724, 727-728 [2005]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).\nMercure, J.P., Crew III, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. Thereafter, he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to four years to life in prison. He now appeals.\nDefense counsel seeks to be relieved of representing defendant on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, however, has filed a pro se brief raising issues of the voluntariness of the plea, the effectiveness of counsel and the severity of the sentence. Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s challenges to the voluntariness of the plea and the effectiveness of counsel are not preserved for our review given defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914 [2003]; People v Angus, 303 AD2d 829, 829 [2003]). His challenge to the severity of the sentence is likewise precluded by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Young, 302 AD2d 798, 799 [2003]).

Defendant further requested that County Court order his enrollment in the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program (see Penal Law \u00a7 60.04 [6]). County Court declined to do so and defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. As defendant was convicted of a controlled substance offense, County Court was permitted to order defendant\u2019s enrollment in the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program as a matter of discretion (see Penal Law \u00a7 60.04 [6]; see e.g. People v Wade, 51 AD3d 601, 601 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 742 [2008]; People v Edell, 45 AD3d 461, 461 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1033 [2008]).

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 41/2 years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, due to County Court\u2019s failure during allocution to distinguish the right to appeal from the rights forfeited by his guilty plea, is unpersuasive; defendant, through his counseled written waiver, acknowledged his right to appeal, that he had discussed the waiver of that right and its consequences with counsel, and that he was waiving the right voluntarily (see People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 671-672 [2007]; see also People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122, 1123 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 925 [2009]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d 686, 687 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 794 [2008]; People v Getter, 52 AD3d 1117, 1118 [2008]; People v Cross, 42 AD3d 586, 587 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 960 [2007]).

Supreme Court advised defendant that, because he was required to be sentenced as a second felony offender, a sentence of at least 4xh to 9 years in prison would have to be imposed. However, the court made a commitment to defendant that the longest sentence it would impose would be 6 to 12 years in prison. Ultimately, the court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 5 to 10 years. Defendant retained his right to appeal and now exercises that right.\nDefendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy which cast significant doubt upon his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see id.). Regardless, defendant\u2019s affirmative answers to Supreme Court\u2019s in quiries sufficiently established the elements of the crimes, that he had not been coerced into pleading guilty and that he understood the proceedings as well as the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty (see People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]).\nThe sentence imposed is not harsh and excessive under the circumstances. Indeed, despite defendant\u2019s prior criminal history and pattern of substance abuse, Supreme Court sentenced him to less than the longest potential sentence agreed to upon his plea (see People v Coles, supra at 666; People v Butterfield, 9 AD3d 682, 682 [2004]). Furthermore, the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances warranting modification of the sentence imposed (see People v Jenkins, 19 AD3d 745, 745 [2005]; People v Mills, 17 AD3d 712, 713 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

The plea bargain included an agreed-upon sentence and was made in full satisfaction of other criminal charges pending against her. At sentencing defendant sought to withdraw her plea, contending that she misunderstood the significance of a Grand Jury proceeding and that she was innocent. County Court denied the application. Defendant appeals her conviction.\nWe reject defendant\u2019s .contention that her application to withdraw her plea was improvidently denied. Prior to sentencing defendant retained new counsel. Upon the original sentencing date new counsel orally sought to withdraw defendant\u2019s plea upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sentencing was adjourned one week to provide defendant with the opportunity to order a transcription of the plea minutes. Upon the rescheduled sentencing date, defense counsel orally renewed defendant\u2019s motion.\nThere is no suggestion in the record that defendant was not given an adequate opportunity to present her contentions. Quite the contrary to her generalized protestation of innocence at sentencing, prior to her guilty plea defendant extensively and specifically stated the circumstances of the crime. She pleaded guilty only after consultation with her attorney and after detailed explanation and inquiry by County Court concerning her rights and the crime.

On May 5, 1997, defendant failed to appear for sentencing and a warrant was issued for her arrest. In June 1997, a second indictment charged defendant with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in connection with drug transactions which had occurred in April 1997, while defendant was awaiting sentencing on the first indictment. De fendant was ultimately arrested and returned to Chemung County, where she pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the second indictment.

The sentences were less than the maximum authorized, consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, and were imposed concurrently despite the fact that at the time of the sale defendant was out on bail awaiting sentencing on the possession charge and later absconded.

On the court\u2019s own motion, the appeal is deemed to be from the judgment as amended by a resentencing of the defendant on September 26, 1979 pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law. Amended judgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence. As so modified amended judgment affirmed and the case is remanded to Criminal Term for further proceedings consistent herewith. Prior to the entry of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the court expressed its intention to impose a sentence of from one year to life imprisonment on the count of the indictment charging the defendant with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The court assured the defendant that if that sentence could not be imposed he would be permitted to withdraw his plea. Thereafter, without offering the defendant the promised opportunity to withdraw his plea, the court sentenced him to a term of one and one-half years to life imprisonment. Neither the defendant nor his attorney objected to the sentence as imposed. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s sentence was modified pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law, and he was resentenced to a term of from one and one-half to four and one-half years in prison. In our view, the court\u2019s failure to fulfill the plea agreement requires a modification. A defendant must be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea where it was induced by a sentencing promise which the court is unable or unwilling to fulfill. (See, e.g., People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert den 419 US 1122; People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751.) The defendant\u2019s failure to object or to remind the court of a plea agreement does not constitute a waiver of his right to withdraw his plea rather than accept a sentence greater than the one promised him by the court. (See People v Esposito, 32 NY2d 921; People v Glasby, 44 AD2d 541.) Under the circumstances at bar, and in view of the defendant\u2019s resentencing, we deem it an appropriate remedy to vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and to remand the case to Criminal Term with a direction to resentence the defendant by (1) imposing the promised minimum term of one year, and (2) fixing an appropriate maximum term pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law.

The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 4V2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court imposed that sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s contention that the motion practice and discovery efforts of defense counsel amounted to ineffective assistance was \u201cforfeited by his guilty plea, as a defendant who enters a plea and admits guilt \u2018may not later seek review of claims relating to the deprivation of rights that took place before the plea was entered\u2019 \u201d (People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013], quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]). Defendant further asserts that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender, inasmuch as he was deprived of the opportunity to contest the allegations contained in the prior felony information as required by CPL 400.21 (3). This claim is unpreserved for our review given defendant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing (see People v House, 119 AD3d 1289, 1290 [2014]; People v Morse, 111 AD3d 1161, 1161 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1040 [2014]). In any event, because a second felony offender statement was filed by the People and defendant was well aware that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender when he entered his guilty plea, we find that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; People v Chrysler, 260 AD2d 945, 945-946 [1999]; People v Mann, 258 AD2d 738, 739 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 900 [1999]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr. and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Otsego County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea.

The court found substantial compliance with the relevant procedural requirements regarding the second felony offender status.<|eot_id|>"}

P.\nAppeal from an order of the County Court of Sullivan County (Leaman, J.), entered June 12, 1996, which denied defendant\u2019s application for permission to inspect Grand Jury minutes.\nDefendant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. In connection with the appeal of that convic tion, defendant requested a copy of the Grand Jury minutes underlying his indictment. County Court denied the request and defendant has appealed from that order.\nWe affirm. The apparent basis for defendant\u2019s request was the alleged insufficiency of the evidence before the Grand Jury.

Even if it is accepted that he was also challenging defects in the Grand Jury proceeding itself, which is not waived by a guilty plea (see, People v Wilkins, 68 NY2d 269, 277, n 7), defendant\u2019s allegations fail to show the \"compelling and particularized need for access\u201d that is required before access to Grand Jury minutes may be obtained (Matter of Hudson v Albany County Grand Jury, 165 AD2d 966, 967).\nWhite, Casey, Yesawich Jr. and Spain, JJ., concur.

In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant thereafter moved, pursuant to CPL 440.10, to vacate the judgment on the basis of, among other things, the ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, with permission, from the order denying his postconviction motion.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s unchallenged waiver of appeal precludes his contention that the grand jury minutes were deficient on the basis that the People may have failed to instruct the grand jury on the agency defense (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]), as well as his claim that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [2015]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2014]).\nWhile portions of defendant\u2019s claim that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective survive his guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Casey, 95 NY2d 354, 363 [2000]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1265-1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]), they are without merit. Specifically, \u201cwhere an indictment count incorporates by reference the statutory provision applicable to the crime intended to be charged, it has been repeatedly held that this is sufficient to apprise the defendant of the charge and, therefore, renders the count jurisdictionally valid\u201d (People v Moon, 119 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1004 [2014] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]). Here, because counts two and seven of the indictment \u2014 i.e., the counts to which defendant pleaded guilty \u2014 recite, among other things, the specific section of the Penal Law under which defendant was charged, those counts of the indictment were not jurisdictionally defective (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1023-1024 [2013]; People v Motz, 52 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 791 [2008]). Moreover, although the People concede that the two counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree are jurisdiction-ally defective, defects contained in the counts to which defendant did not plead guilty constitute mere technical flaws that are precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal (see People v Olmstead, 111 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2013]; People v Maye, 69 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 807 [2010]).\nDefendant next asserts that his plea should be vacated because the People breached their promise to make County Court aware of his cooperation and recommend a lower sentence. Although this contention is not precluded by defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal (see People v Dame, 100 AD3d 1032, 1034 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]; People v Carter, 64 AD3d 1089, 1091 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 835 [2009]), it nonetheless evades our review inasmuch as defendant failed to properly preserve the argument with a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Parsons, 3 AD3d 790, 791 [2004]). In any event, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the agreed-upon plea bargain.\nHowever, we do agree with defendant\u2019s contention that remittal to County Court is required inasmuch as his CPL 440.10 motion was improperly denied without a hearing, as defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are based upon matters not apparent on the face of the record (compare CPL 440.30; People v Satterfield 66 NY2d 796, 799 [1985]). Specifically, defendant\u2019s pro se motion to vacate the judgment of conviction contains sworn allegations of ineffective assistance based upon counsel\u2019s failure to engage in discovery or motion practice and counsel pressuring him to accept the plea offered by the People, as well as arguments that we construe to implicate the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea. The People opposed defendant\u2019s application, by way of letter, solely on the basis that a direct appeal was already pending (see CPL 440.10 [2] [b]) and provided no additional documentary proof regarding the substance of defendant\u2019s allegations. County Court agreed with the People and denied the motion without a hearing.\nThe record before us contains no motions or discovery, and the reason for their absence is not apparent. We are able to ascertain only the following from the record. In June 2012, at arraignment on the indictment, defendant signed a preplea waiver \u2014 also absent from the record and, notably, innocuously referred to by County Court as \u201cthe yellow sheet\u201d \u2014 permitting a preplea investigation by the Probation Department and a report to be sent to County Court. We are unable to determine whether counsel was present with defendant during his interview with the Probation Department. Two months later, defendant wrote to County Court expressing his dissatisfaction with counsel \u2014 a complaint that, at least according to this record, remains substantively unaddressed prior to defendant\u2019s plea in September 2012. Two days shy of one year following his arraignment, defendant was finally sentenced and a subsequent letter from defense counsel to defendant appears in the file, which profoundly misstates the facts and circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s plea, among other things, as we otherwise know them. Inasmuch as there is no factual record of defendant\u2019s claims, we are powerless to properly address them. Therefore, upon the record before us, we are of the view that a hearing should have been held on his CPL 440.10 motion to determine the validity of defendant\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThus, the matter must be remitted to County Court for a hearing on defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Furthermore, because defendant\u2019s arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal likewise concern matters outside the record, these claims are more properly the subject of a postconviction motion (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]; People v Jenkins, 130 AD3d 1091, 1092 [2015]; People v Green, 9 AD3d 687, 688 [2004]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr. and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed. Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Warren County for a hearing on defendant\u2019s CPL article 440 motion.\nDefendant was sentenced to time served with respect to the conviction of unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance and unlawfully dealing with a child, but reversed the order denying his motion to vacate the conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel, which was improperly denied without a hearing. The case is remitted to the County Court for a hearing on the defendant's claims regarding ineffective assistance, as these issues were not evident in the record. The defendant was sentenced to time served for the charge of unlawfully dealing with a child.<|eot_id|>"}

Under the terms of his plea agreement, County Court agreed to sentence defendant to a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision provided that he did not have any undisclosed prior felonies. Upon finding thereafter that defendant had a prior felony conviction that had not been considered, the court adjourned sentencing for further review and to allow defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Defendant chose not to withdraw his plea and agreed to proceed to sentencing and to be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of six years with two years of post-release supervision; the court then imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we find that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude his challenge to the sentence, as his written waiver executed in the course of the plea proceedings expressly recited only the original four-year sentence. Turning to the merits, in light of defendant\u2019s criminal history and the severity of the conduct underlying his conviction, we reject his sole contention on appeal that the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive (see People v Tetreault, 131 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]; People v Ensley, 53 AD3d 929, 930 [2008]).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Egan Jr. and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court of Washington County, which sentenced him to six years in prison for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after he pleaded guilty.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding the sentence appropriate given the defendant's criminal history and the nature of his offense, despite his claim that it was harsh and excessive.<|eot_id|>"}

As a result, he was convicted following a jury trial of nine counts of placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender on each count to a prison term of seven years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving. On appeal, this Court reduced all counts to placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the second degree and remitted the matter to County Court for resentencing (People v Lettley, 64 AD3d 901 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 836 [2009]). Thereafter, County Court resentenced defendant as a second violent felony offender on each count to a prison term of four years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, and directed them to run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has exhibited disturbing behavior in his plan to create hysteria and instill fear in parties completely unknown to him. In view of this, and given the violent nature of his prior crimes, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Nelson, 56 AD3d 899 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]).\nPeters, J.P, Spain, Kavanagh, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

The first contention is apparently bottomed on the fact that, in spite of his assurance of complete cooperation in any further related investigation or prosecution, he was not granted his hoped-for sentence of lifetime probation as permitted by section 65.00 of the Penal Law. Defendant contends that because he promised to cooperate, he was entitled to that sentence and the trial court\u2019s failure to impose it was an abuse of discretion. This view overlooks the fact that one of the predicates for such a disposition is a recommendation from the District Attorney. No such recommendation was made, promised for or suggested in any manner in the plea bargain agreement, which specifically and unequivocally called for a sentence with a minimum of three years and a maximum of life imprisonment. Nor was there any mention of such a disposition in the extended colloquies between defendant and the court. In addition, no extraordinary circumstances evincing an abuse of discretion have been demonstrated which would warrant our interference with the sentence imposed (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 305; People v Miller, 74 AD2d 961).\nWe likewise find no merit to defendant\u2019s second contention. This court has recently concluded that section 60.35 of the Penal Law was a constitutionally permissible enactment by the Legislature (People v Dodson, 96 AD2d 1116, 1118).\nJudgment affirmed.

The defendant absconded but was returned on a warrant three years later and was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 5 to 10 years. He now seeks to have his sentences vacated on the ground that they were imposed without the benefit of an updated presentence report (see, People v Sanchez, 143 AD2d 377; People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93; People v Halaby, 77 AD2d 717).\nThe record shows that the probation department reinterviewed the defendant prior to sentencing and prepared and submitted to the court an addendum to the original presentence report. The information regarding his employment history and family situation that the defendant now claims was omitted from the addendum was brought to the court\u2019s attention by defense counsel. In any event, the record makes clear that the one-half year increase in the sentence originally promised resulted from the defendant\u2019s failure to appear for sentencing and not from any deficiency in the information possessed by the court. Accordingly, resentencing is not required. Mangano, P.

As part of the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal except as to the sentence he would receive. County Court sentenced defendant to six months in jail and five years\u2019 probation.\nOn appeal, defendant first contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because certain pretrial motions were not made on his behalf. Although defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from raising this argument (see, People v Hartford, 217 AD2d 798; People v Rosado, 199 AD2d 833, lv denied 83 NY2d 876), defendant has failed to show that his attorney had no legitimate reason to forego the pretrial motions, so as to rebut the presumption that counsel acted competently (see, People v Hartford, supra). Our review of the record reveals that meaningful representation was provided at all stages of the proceeding (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 146-147).\nNor do we find defendant\u2019s sentence harsh or excessive.

Following an unsuccessful motion to suppress the marihuana and his statement to police that it belonged to him, defendant, who was out on bail, absconded out of state. Ultimately, he was located and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree in satisfaction of the indictment, as well as a bail jumping charge. He waived his right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison, defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal precludes the claims that his suppression motion was improperly denied (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Carroll, 21 AD3d 586 [2005]), that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the suppression hearing (see People v Wright, 21 AD3d 583 [2005]; People v Carroll, supra) and that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804-805 [2004]). To the extent that defendant also challenges the voluntariness of his plea, claiming that he did not sufficiently admit to the facts underlying the crime, we note that he has failed to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction. Thus, this issue is unpreserved for our review (see People v Rivera, 20 AD3d 763, 764 [2005]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]). In any event, our review of the plea allocution satisfies us that the plea was entered knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently and that defendant\u2019s affirmative response to County Court\u2019s questioning established a factual basis for the crime of which he was convicted {see People v Rivera, supra; People v Mahar, 12 AD3d 715, 716 [2004]).\nCardona, P.J., Peters, Spain and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant appeals, contending that because this is her first felony conviction, the sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. While the sentence imposed by County Court was slightly more severe than the statutory minimum sentence of 1 to 3 years (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]), it was less than the negotiated maximum of 2 to 6 years. This, together with the lack of any evidence of extraordinary circumstances meriting a reduction, lead us to conclude that the sentence imposed by County Court should not be disturbed (see, People v Hayes, 236 AD2d 738, lv denied 89 NY2d 1094; People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893).\nMikoll, J.

Following a pretrial suppression hearing, County Court (Herrick, J.) denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs and drug paraphernalia that had been seized. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and reopen the suppression hearing on the basis that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel. As relevant here, defendant claimed that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because his attorney misinformed him regarding the possible term of incarceration that he faced. Supreme Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Prior to pleading guilty, defendant indicated that he understood his rights, had fully discussed the case and potential defenses with his attorney, was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation and was entering his guilty plea freely and voluntarily (see People v La Caille, 26 AD3d 592, 593 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 835 [2006]; People v Henning, 2 AD3d 979, 980 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 740 [2004]). The record also reveals that defense counsel, who conferred with defendant immediately after Supreme Court detailed the agreed-upon sentence, obtained a very favorable plea bargain which significantly reduced defendant\u2019s prison exposure. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant was afforded meaningful representation and that his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Bolden, 14 AD3d 934, 935 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 796 [2005]; People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 935 [2004]; People v Stone, 9 AD3d 498, 499 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 712 [2004]). Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are precluded by his valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]).\nCrew III, Spain, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

As part of the agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence of two consecutive one-year jail terms and ordered restitution in the amount of $360. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant argues on appeal that the restitution component of his sentence should be vacated because, at the time of the plea, neither County Court nor the People advised him that restitution would be required as a condition of the plea agreement. As the People concede, the record reflects that, while restitution had been included in a prior plea offer that defendant had rejected, it was not included as a part of this plea agreement. Accordingly, under these circumstances, neither defendant\u2019s unchallenged waiver of appeal nor his failure to preserve this issue through an objection at sentencing precludes this claim (see People v Rubio, 133 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2015]; People v Culcleasure, 75 AD3d 832, 832 [2010]).\nThe sole relief that defendant requests on appeal is modification of his sentence to vacate the provision requiring that he make restitution, and the People consent to that relief\u2014representing that defendant has been released from custody. Under the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to vacate the provision of defendant\u2019s sentence imposing restitution, thereby conforming the sentence imposed to the promise made to defendant in exchange for his guilty plea (see People v Nilsen, 129 AD3d 994, 995 [2015]; cf. People v Gregory, 140 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2016]; People v Roberts, 139 AD3d 1092, 1092 [2016]; People v Sheats, 138 AD3d 894, 894-895 [2016]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Lynch, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reversing so much thereof as directed defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $360, and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn an appeal concerning a guilty plea for criminal possession of a controlled substance, the defendant argued that the restitution requirement of $360 was not disclosed at the time of the plea agreement, which he contended should invalidate that component of his sentence. The court agreed, noting that restitution was not part of the final plea agreement, and therefore vacated the restitution requirement while affirming the rest of the sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

At his arraignment on August 27,. 1998, defendant, through his then attorney, acknowledged receiving a copy of the indictment and entered a plea of not guilty. On September 9, 1998 defendant pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment as part of a plea bargain that included an agreement by defendant to plead guilty to a superior court information (hereinafter SCI) charging him with criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, a class E. felony, in return for sentences of 1 to 3 years for the felony charges and 1 year for the misdemeanor charge, all to run concurrently. Defendant also agreed to cooperate with the authorities in a \u201cdebriefing\u201d and the District Attorney agreed to dismiss all misdemeanors pending in the local courts of Columbia County as part of the plea bargain.\nOn October 14, 1998, defendant pleaded guilty to the SCI and expected to be sentenced according to the terms of the plea bargain on all charges to the agreed-upon sentence. Upon reviewing the presentence report, however, County Court noted a prior felony conviction which prevented it from imposing the recommended sentence. Sentencing was adjourned and there after defense counsel obtained an order to show cause seeking specific performance of the plea bargain or, in the alternative, withdrawal of defendant\u2019s guilty plea and appointment of new defense counsel because of a potential conflict of interest. On November 18, 1998 County Court appointed new defense counsel and granted defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The case was then scheduled for trial. On January 7, 1999, after pretrial hearings were concluded, defendant again pleaded guilty to the charges set forth in the indictment and the SCI in exchange for the People\u2019s recommendation for the minimum allowable indeterminate sentence (4V2 to 9 years) on the class B felony to run concurrently with an indeterminate sentence (2 to 4 years) on the class E felony and a 1-year definite sentence on the class A misdemeanor. The People agreed to forego prosecution of a second sale of narcotics charge and misdemeanor charges pending in Hudson City Court and defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant according to the terms of his plea bargain and he now appeals.\nDefendant contends that County Court did not properly inform him of the charges against him at his arraignment on August 27, 1998 in violation of CPL 210.15 (1) and, therefore, never acquired jurisdiction over him. Defendant\u2019s contention is without merit. The record reveals that defendant was arraigned on a valid accusatory instrument (see, People v Ford, 62 NY2d 275), was represented by counsel (see, CPL 210.15 [2]), was provided with a copy of the indictment (see, CPL 210.15 [1]) and waived a reading of the indictment prior to pleading not guilty to the charges. We find that County Court properly arraigned defendant on the charges in the indictment and obtained jurisdiction over his person. There is no indication in this record that any right of defendant, constitutional or statutory, was violated at his arraignment. Defendant makes no such jurisdictional argument with respect to the procedures leading to his plea of guilty to the charge set forth in the SCI.\nDefendant next contends that this Court should reduce his sentence in the interest of justice. Defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is unfair is not preserved for our review because of his knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Kwiatkowski, 263 AD2d 552, lv denied 93 NY2d 1021; People v Shaw, 261 AD2d 648). In any event, such argument is groundless. County Court imposed the minimum sentence allowable for a second felony class B conviction despite defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history. County Court did not abuse its discretion nor are any extraordinary circumstances present to warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Marcano, 265 AD2d 673, lv dismissed 95 NY2d 800; People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, lv denied 93 NY2d 968).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments have been considered and found to be without merit.\nCardona, P. J., Peters, Spain and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant, who pleaded guilty to multiple drug-related charges and possession of stolen property as part of a plea bargain. The court found no jurisdictional issues during the defendant's arraignment and determined that the sentencing was appropriate given the defendant's criminal history and the terms of the plea agreement. The defendant's claims regarding the fairness of the sentence were deemed unpreserved due to a prior waiver of appeal rights, and the court found no extraordinary circumstances warranting a sentence reduction.<|eot_id|>"}

In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years.\nWe are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that the waiver of the right to appeal is ineffective due to the catch-all provision purporting to waive all appealable matters defendant may have as of right. Although nonwaivable issues are excluded from the scope of the waiver, the remainder of the waiver is valid and enforceable (see People v Wagoner, 6 AD3d 985 [2004]; People v Umber, 2 AD3d 1051, 1052 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]).

Were we to consider the merits of the argument, we would find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed despite defendant\u2019s youth and sparse criminal history (see People v Baker, 6 AD3d 751 [2004]; People v Baker, 195 AD2d 700 [1993]).

Following a jury trial, he was convicted of both charges and was sentenced as a second felony offender to consecutive terms of 71/2 to 15 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nHis sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has an extensive criminal record dating back to his youth and the charges at issue appear to have arisen from defendant\u2019s participation in a pattern of drug-related activity. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences (see People v Davis, 4 AD3d 567, 568 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 798 [2004]; People v Parker, 305 AD2d 871, 872 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 597 [2003]).

Defendant appeals contending that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he thought he was receiving a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years.\nInitially, although defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal at the time of his plea does not preclude him from subsequently arguing the voluntariness of his plea (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), inasmuch as defendant failed to withdraw his plea when given the opportunity by County Court at sentencing, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 831, lv denied 95 NY2d 966). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea. At a hearing prior to sentencing, defendant expressed concern that consecutive sentences would affect his eligibility for temporary release. County Court adjourned the proceeding and appointed new counsel for defendant so that the ramifications of receiving consecutive sentences could be explored. After consulting with his new attorney, defendant indicated that he did not wish to withdraw his plea.

Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a two-count superior court information. In accepting the plea, County Court made no commitment as to the sentence to be imposed. The court ultimately sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years, to be served consecutively to the sentence he was currently serving. Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that this sentence was harsh and excessive because, inter alia, the District Attorney recommended a lesser sentence.\nNotably, where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it shall not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685). Here, although defendant received the harshest permissible sentence, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court.

In light of the fact that the defendant and her codefendant were found to be in possession of a significant amount of cocaine, as well as an assault rifle and ammunition that had been purchased by the defendant, and the otherwise favorable plea agreement, the sentencing court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying her request for youthful offender treatment.

Despite diligent efforts, the People were unable to locate the informant. At the close of the People\u2019s case, the court stated that it would permit the People to reopen their case if the informant was located by 9:00 the following morning, and the court directed the attorneys to proceed with their summations. The informant appeared the next morning and he was permitted to testify, after which the attorneys again presented summations.\nThe statutory order of trial (CPL 260.30) is not a rigid framework; the trial court retains its common-law discretionary power to alter the order of proof \"at least up to the time the case is submitted to the jury\u201d (People v Olsen, 34 NY2d 349, 353). We see no abuse of that discretion here. The informant\u2019s testimony was clearly relevant if not crucial to the People\u2019s case, and there is nothing to suggest that the People were seeking to gain an improper tactical advantage (see, People v Murray, 165 AD2d 690, lv denied 77 NY2d 880).\nNext, defendant contends that County Court erred in permitting one of the People\u2019s witnesses to \"buttress the character\u201d of the informant. In the absence of a timely objection by defendant, we are of the view that the error, if any, is not reviewable (see, People v Major, 142 AD2d 603). In any event, defense counsel initiated the line of questioning concerning the witness\u2019s assessment of the informant\u2019s reliability.\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s final contention that his prison sentence of 5 to 15 years is harsh and excessive. The harshest sentence for the class B felony committed by defendant is 8 Vs to 25 years (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [B]; [3] [B]). Although defendant\u2019s sentence was made consecutive with his sentence on a second drug conviction (see, People v Hinkley, 178 AD2d 821 [decided herewith]), we see neither a clear abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances and, therefore, we will not disturb the sentence (see, People v Jones, 85 AD2d 50, 55).\nMahoney, P.

Lastly, the court found the defendant's sentence of 5 to 15 years to be appropriate given the circumstances and statutory guidelines.<|eot_id|>"}

This Court has the broad authority to modify a sentence in the interest of justice, even one within the permissible statutory parameters (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783 [1992]; People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]). In light of defendant\u2019s admission from the outset that he perpetrated the robbery, albeit without a knife, the correlation between the illness that he contracted while serving in Afghanistan and an opioid addiction that precipitated this event, his duly expressed remorse and his lack of any prior criminal record, we find that his sentence for the criminal possession of a controlled substance conviction was unduly severe and should be reduced to three years, with five years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently with the sentences for his other convictions. Correspondingly, we vacate the $5,000 fine.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Clark and Pritzker, JJ., concur.\nDefendant returned to Afghanistan for a second tour of duty in 2013.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for robbery in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, and grand larceny in the third degree, stemming from a pharmacy robbery in which he demanded oxycodone while allegedly armed. However, the court found the defendant's sentence to be excessively harsh given his military service-related mental health issues and opioid addiction, leading to a reduction of his sentence for criminal possession of a controlled substance to three years, with concurrent terms for his other convictions, and vacated a $5,000 fine.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a five-year prison term, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, and recommended that defendant be considered for any substance abuse programs that the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision deemed him eligible for. After the court imposed defendant\u2019s sentence, defendant\u2019s counsel stated that the court was empowered to order that defendant participate in a Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program \u2014 a statement that the court construed as a motion for such an order. The court denied the motion. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, the record establishes that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. County Court confirmed that defendant understood that his right to appeal was separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea and confirmed that defendant understood that certain appeal rights, which the court enumerated, would not be foreclosed by an appeal waiver. Defendant explicitly waived his appeal rights, without qualification, during the same colloquy. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s waiver was valid, and that waiver forecloses our review of discretionary sentencing determinations (see People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 969 [2014]; People v Wolz, 112 AD3d 1150, 1152 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1026 [2014]).\nIn any event, defendant\u2019s challenge to the CASAT determination is without merit. Although County Court was initially unaware of its power to order defendant\u2019s participation in CASAT, defendant apprised the court of its statutory authority to do so (see Penal Law \u00a7 60.04 [6]). Defendant\u2019s contention that the court nonetheless denied defendant CASAT participation due to a mistaken belief that it did not have the power to make such an order is without specific support in the record and is therefore speculative. In addition, the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to order defendant\u2019s participation in the CASAT program (see People v Walker, 95 AD3d 1240, 1241 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1002 [2012]; People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]).\nLahtinen, J.P., Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a valid waiver of appeal. The court found that the defendant's challenge to the denial of participation in a Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (CASAT) program lacked merit, as the lower court did not abuse its discretion in its decision. The waiver of appeal precluded review of discretionary sentencing determinations.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant raises two issues on this appeal neither of which has merit. The periods of delay between the time of defendant\u2019s arrest on November 4, 1974 and his plea on June 17, 1975 which are the basis of his first argument were not significant in extent and there is no allegation that any delay alleged herein was the result of the failure of the People to be ready for trial (CPL 30.30). Additionally, there has been no demonstration that he has been prejudiced by the alleged delays (see People v Imbesi, 38 NY2d 629). We find no basis for defendant\u2019s remaining contention, based upon the claimed involuntariness of the plea. Defendant\u2019s plea was in satisfaction of a three-count indictment. At the time the plea was entered, defendant responded to the inquiry of the court by stating that the only promise made to him in connection with the plea was the agreement of the People to recommend the minimum sentence. He also admitted selling a narcotic drug for the sum of $20. Defendant received the minimum sentence, just as promised. The record of the plea and sentence proceedings fully justifies acceptance of the plea (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227). Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P. J., Sweeney, Larkin, Herlihy and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from a judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance was denied, as the court found no merit in the defendant's arguments regarding delays in the proceedings or the voluntariness of his guilty plea. The delays were not significant and did not result from the prosecution's unpreparedness, and the defendant's plea was accepted after he confirmed the absence of any undue promises, receiving the minimum sentence as agreed. The judgment was affirmed by the court.<|eot_id|>"}

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 10, 2001, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and tampering, with physical evidence.\nAfter allegedly being observed by police with numerous bags of crack cocaine, defendant was arrested and eventually indicted for the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and tampering with evidence. Defendant, a second felony offender, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a sentence of 6 to 16 years in prison. He appealed and we reversed since the prison sentence was not authorized by the controlling statutes (282 AD2d 834 [2001]). Defendant was then offered a sentence of 6 to 12 years, which he rejected, electing instead to proceed to trial. He was found guilty by a jury of the three crimes charged in the indictment and received concurrent sentences of incarceration, the longest of which was 12\u00bd to 25 years. Defendant appeals.\nWe are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was harsh and excessive or should be modified in the interest of justice. With respect to his argument that he was allegedly penalized for deciding to exercise his right to a jury trial, we have previously observed that \u201c[t]he mere fact that a sentence imposed after trial is greater than that offered in connection with plea negotiations is not proof that defendant was punished for asserting his right to trial\u201d (People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, 867 [1992], lvs denied 80 NY2d 838 [1992]; see People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 411-412 [1980], cert denied 449 US 1087 [1981]). Defendant had a lengthy criminal record, including numerous prior drug-related arrests and violent felony convictions. County Court stated that the sentence was in response to defendant\u2019s recidivism, lack of remorse and previous failures at rehabilitation. Under such circumstances, the sentence was within County Court\u2019s discretion (see People v Miles, 8 AD3d 758, 761 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 678 [2004]; People v Franklin, 288 AD2d 751, 756 [2001], lv denied, 97 NY2d 728 [2002]; People v Amadeo, 268 AD2d 672, 673-674 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 832 [2000]). There is no indication in the record that the sentence was motivated in any respect by retaliation or vindictiveness because defendant exercised his right to trial (see People v Simon, supra at 867). Nor are we persuaded by defendant\u2019s further assertion that County Court imposed a lengthy sentence as a result of being \u201cclearly impassioned\u201d by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred one month before sentencing.\nDefendant\u2019s pro se argument that County Court improperly precluded him from impeaching the police officers was neither preserved for appeal nor is it supported by the record. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s further pro se challenge to County Court\u2019s determination that there was probable cause for his arrest. One of the officers, who was an experienced member of the narcotics unit, testified at the suppression hearing about watching from an unmarked car as defendant counted bags of crack cocaine. This evidence, which County Court found credible, established probable cause for the arrest (see People v Earley, 244 AD2d 769, 770-771 [1997]; see also People v Maldonado, 86 NY2d 631, 635-636 [1995]).\nMercure, J.P., Spain and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of eight years to life. On appeal, defendant contends that the waiver of his right to appeal, which was made part of his guilty plea, was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that County Court did not enter into a meaningful colloquy on the record to ascertain that it was. He also argues that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nInitially, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the waiver was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that County Court did not enter into a meaningful colloquy (see, People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769; People v Catalfamo, 228 AD2d 786, 787-788; People v Hendrickson, 227 AD2d 801; cf., People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283). The record reveals that defendant signed a written waiver of his right to appeal which stated that he gave up his right to appeal issues relating to his conviction and sentence and that the waiver was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently executed. In addition, during the plea allocution, County Court advised defendant of the many rights he would be relinquishing by pleading guilty. The court specifically ddvised defendant that he would be waiving his appeal rights as this was a condition requested by the District Attorney as part of the plea bargain. Defendant responded on the record that he understood the court\u2019s admonitions, that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily and that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation. In view of this, defendant\u2019s guilty plea and the waiver of his right to appeal must be enforced (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1).\nNevertheless, were we to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s challenge to the sentence imposed, we would not find it to be harsh or excessive. Defendant was a second felony offender with a history of prior drug-related convictions. In view of this, as well as the fact that the sentence was agreed to by defendant as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb it (see, People v Minshell, 196 AD2d 911, lv denied 82 NY2d 851; People v Albert, 195 AD2d 893, lv denied 82 NY2d 890).\nCardona, P.

Additionally, the court determined that the sentence of eight years to life, imposed as part of a plea bargain and taking into account the defendant's status as a second felony offender, was not harsh or excessive.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant pied guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree- in violation of section 220.10 of the Penal Law. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term not to exceed four years. Defendant raises two issues on this appeal. First, that the testimony produced at the suppression hearing failed to establish either actual or constructive possession of a dangerous drug, and second, that the sentence was unduly harsh. The record reveals that defendant occupied an apartment on the tenth floor of a hotel; that the People had obtained a search warrant to search, among other places, that apartment; that one of the officers assigned to the ease observed defendant get out of an elevator on the tenth floor and place a brown paper bag into the base of a floor-type ashtray. This bag was later removed by the officer and found, on examination, to contain heroin. There was also testimony that a search of defendant\u2019s apartment produced certain \u201c drug paraphenalia \u201d. Defendant contends, among other things, that the proof establishes that there were times when there was no one watching the ashtray and this constitutes a fatal defect in the proof. An examination of the record in its entirety clearly supports a conclusion that defendant exercised sufficient control over the heroin to constitute constructive possession (People v. Diaz, 41 A D 2d 382). Consequently, we agree with the conclusion of the trial court. While the sentence was the maximum allowed, it was within the statutory limits. The court had the benefit of a sentencing memorandum submitted on behalf of the defendant. The sentence was within the sound discretion of the court, and we do not find it excessive. Judgment affirmed. Staley, Jr., J.

We disagree. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty as a second felony offender to one count of promoting prostitution in the second degree in full satisfaction of a five-count indictment. Sentencing was then adjourned so that defendant could attend an 18-month drug rehabilitation program with the understanding that if defendant failed to satisfactorily complete the program County Court could impose any sentence it felt appropriate. Defendant subsequently was dismissed from the rehabilitation program and was sentenced to 3 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant admittedly was dismissed from the rehabilitation program because of his conviction of a misdemeanor drug charge. Once defendant was dismissed from the program, by the terms of the plea agreement County Court could sentence him to up to 7 Vi to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment (see, People v Chevalier, 92 AD2d 944). In consideration of these facts, and that defendant was given the most lenient sentence possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, lv denied 75 NY2d 812).\nMikoll, J.

In exchange, he was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, contending that his guilty plea should be vacated because he entered it under the apprehension that he would be eligible for participation in a shock incarceration program (see, Correction Law art 26-A). Although the record is silent in this regard, defendant was apparently denied admission to a shock incarceration program following his conviction.\nIn any event, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention. A review of the plea hearing transcript discloses that while defendant\u2019s eligibility for participation in a shock incarceration program was briefly discussed by defense counsel and County Court, his admission was never made a condition of the plea agreement (see, People v Christian, 158 AD2d 705, 706), nor could the agreement have been conditioned thereon as admission to the program is not determined until an inmate has submitted an application that has been screened by a \"shock incarceration selection committee\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 866 [2]) and, if approved by the committee, has been passed on to the Commissioner of Correctional Services for a final determination (see, Correction Law \u00a7 867 [2]). Hence, defendant\u2019s admission to a shock incarceration program could not have been made a condition of the plea bargain agreement as neither the prosecution nor County Court had the power to guarantee his participation therein. Defendant has failed to show that his plea was other than, knowing, voluntary and counseled; hence, the judgment of conviction will not be disturbed.\nCardona, P.

Following the denial of his motion to suppress identification evidence, the matter proceeded to trial. On the day trial was scheduled to begin, defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of the crimes charged in the indictment, with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of lifetime probation if he cooperated with law enforcement officials, including the United States Attorney\u2019s office and any other law enforcement agency deemed necessary; otherwise he would receive, at a minimum, a sentence of 372 years in prison. Notably, defendant executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.\nAfter the United States Attorney\u2019s office showed no interest in defendant\u2019s cooperation, defendant conceded that he had agreed to cooperate with any law enforcement agency required, and indicated his willingness to cooperate with local authorities in order to satisfy the plea bargain. When defendant appeared for sentencing, however, the People indicated that he had failed to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Defendant then moved to withdraw his plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 372 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that his waiver of his right to appeal is invalid in light of the detailed, comprehensive written waiver that he executed when he entered his plea, as well as the colloquy in County Court further explaining the waiver at that time and defendant\u2019s reaffirmation of the waiver following the denial of his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d 686, 687 [2008]; People v VanDusen, 49 AD3d 1031, 1031-1032 [2008]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d 880, 880-881 [2008]). Although defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea survives his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d at 881), it is unpersuasive. A review of the record reveals that defendant confessed to the facts underlying the crimes and, as noted above, agreed to the condition that he cooperate with \u201claw enforcement officials,\u201d including the United States Attorney\u2019s office and any other required law enforcement agency, in order to receive lifetime probation. Nevertheless, defendant failed to cooperate with authorities, despite the fact that his sentencing was postponed for approximately one year through multiple adjournments to allow him to meet the cooperation requirement. Under these circumstances, County Court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea\u2014which was based upon his unsubstantiated claims that he was innocent, had no information to provide authorities, and did not understand that cooperation with the authorities was a required condition of the plea\u2014and imposed a term of imprisonment in light of defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement (see People v Kirkland, 53 AD3d 673, 674 [2008]; People v Nicholson, 50 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2008]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 895 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]; People v Walker, 266 AD2d 727, 728 [1999], lv denied 96 NY2d 909 [2001]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining challenges to the severity of his agreed-upon sentence, the denial of his suppression motion and County Court\u2019s decision to resolve his motion to withdraw the plea without a hearing are precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d at 688; People v VanDusen, 49 AD3d at 1031-1032).\nCardona, EJ., Spain, Lahtinen and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nFurthermore, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request for substitution of counsel (see, People v Sawyer, 57 NY2d 12, cert denied 459 US 1178; People v Arroyave, 49 NY2d 264). The defendant\u2019s request was made after the commencement of trial (People v Arroyave, supra, at 271-272), and he did not demonstrate sufficient good cause to warrant substitution (see, People v Sawyer, supra, at 19; People v Rodriguez, 126 AD2d 580).\nSimilarly, the sentence imposed upon the defendant was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). The imposition of consecutive sentences for each conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and for bail jumping in the second degree was appropriate under the circumstances of this case, as the offenses charged constituted separate and distinct acts (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.25; People v Brathwaite, 63 NY2d 839). Moreover, there was no impropriety in the imposition of an aggregate maximum term of 76 years. Since the defendant was convicted of four crimes, at least one of which was a class B felony, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.30 (1) (c) (i), this aggregate maximum term must be deemed 30 years (see, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575; People v Bachman, 158 AD2d 930).

The next day, defendant agreed to a plea bargain relating to five unrelated pending charges set forth in a separate indictment. Pursuant to the terms of the plea bargain, defendant would plead guilty to the five charges set forth in the second indictment in exchange for which the sentences imposed would run concurrently with the prison term imposed upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nDefendant was accordingly sentenced upon his guilty pleas to prison terms of 81/3 to 25 years for second degree attempted murder, 81/3 to 25 years for each of the two counts of first degree criminal use of a weapon, 21h to 7 years for first degree reckless endangerment and 5 to 15 years for first degree assault. All five sentences were to run concurrently with each other and with the sentence imposed on defendant\u2019s previous conviction.\nThis Court subsequently reversed the judgment convicting defendant of third degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, remitting the matter for a new trial on the ground that defendant had been deprived of a fair trial by certain evidentiary rulings made by County Court (see, People v Walker, 217 AD2d 856). Defendant contends in the context of the instant appeal that the judgment convicting him upon his guilty pleas must also be reversed on the ground that he was induced to plead guilty by the prosecution\u2019s promise that the resulting sentences would run concurrently with the sentence imposed for his prior conviction, a conviction which has since been reversed by this Court.\nOur review of the record, however, indicates that defendant\u2019s guilty pleas to the charges in the second indictment were not related to his prior conviction with the exception of the plea bargain agreement that the prison terms resulting therefrom would run concurrently. It is evident that defendant\u2019s guilty pleas were voluntary, uncoerced, and knowingly and intelligently made; that he was represented by competent counsel throughout the proceedings; and that the prosecution abided by its promise regarding the concurrency of the sentences imposed. We can find no justification for enabling defendant to profit from the reversal of one judgment of conviction by reversing a subsequent judgment based on unrelated charges (see, People v Lbwrance, 41 NY2d 303, 304; cf., People v Clark, 45 NY2d 432, 440).

The court concluded there was no basis to reverse the judgment based on the reversal of the earlier conviction.<|eot_id|>"}

This appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which were to suppress statements to law enforcement authorities and physical evidence.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the sentence imposed for criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree from one year to three months imprisonment; and as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.\nThe defendant contends that the People failed to prove a voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights because the police failed to ask him whether, having been apprised of his rights, he was still willing to answer questions. However, because the defendant failed to raise this specific contention at the hearing or in his motion papers, this issue is unpreserved for appellate review (see, People v Tutt, 38 NY2d 1011; People v Alexander, 226 AD2d 548). In any event, an implicit waiver was established on this record (see, People v Sirno, 76 NY2d 967). The circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s admissions to police do not indicate that his admissions were coerced (cf., People v Anderson, 42 NY2d 35).\nThe maximum term of imprisonment upon a conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree is three months (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 221.10, 70.15 [2]). Therefore, the determinate term of one year imprisonment imposed upon that conviction is reduced to three months. The sentence was not otherwise excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit or do not warrant reversal. Bracken, J.

Furthermore, the record as a whole, which includes extensive inquiry by the court, affirmatively demonstrates that the defendant entered his pleas of guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382-383 [2015]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 19 [1983]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that his pleas were involuntary to the extent that he purportedly agreed to forfeit certain cash and cellular phones is unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726 [1995]; People v McNair, 79 AD3d 908, 909 [2010]). In any event, the People\u2019s request that the defendant forfeit the subject property was a collateral, not a direct, consequence of his pleas of guilty (see People v Coleman, 138 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2016]; People v McNair, 79 AD3d at 909), and the County Court \u201cgenerally has no obligation to apprise the defendant of the collateral consequences of the plea\u201d (People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 184 [2013]; see People v Gravino, 14 NY3d 546, 553 [2010]; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]). Moreover, the record shows that the defendant was apprised that the subject forfeitures were part of the plea agreement at the time of each plea and that he agreed to forfeit the property as part of each respective plea agreement {see CPL 220.50 [6]; People v Carmichael, 123 AD3d 1053 [2014]).\nMastro, J.P., Balkin, Cohen and Brathwaite Nelson, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgments convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance under two indictments, finding that the defendant's guilty pleas were made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.

Thereafter, defendant was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon term of 10 to 20 years in prison, with that sentence to run concurrently with a one-year sentence previously imposed upon defendant\u2019s prior probation violation. Contending that he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel and that the negotiated sentence was harsh and excessive, defendant appeals.\nNotably, defendant does not challenge the validity of the waiver of his right to appeal. While that waiver does not bar his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel to the extent that it relates to the voluntariness of his plea, defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders the claim unpreserved for our review\u201d (People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; see People v Garcia-Toro, 42 AD3d 750, 751 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 990 [2007]; People v Morgan, 39 AD3d 889, 890 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 848 [2007]). In any event, even if the issue were properly before us, we would find it to be lacking in merit. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that defendant fully understood the rights he was relinquishing, including the right to make suppression motions, and his potential exposure relative to sentencing. He also acknowledged that he had the opportunity to confer with counsel and expressed satisfaction with counsel\u2019s representation.\nFinally, with respect to defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we note that his valid appeal waiver precludes him from raising this issue (see People v Nickell, 49 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2008]).\nSpain, Carpinello, Malone Jr. and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.

The plea was taken in full satisfaction of charges brought and which could be brought against defendant stemming from a narcotics trafficking investigation conducted in Sullivan and Delaware Counties. In exchange for his plea, defendant was to receive concurrent prison sentences of 4 to 12 years. The agreement included a protection order prohibiting defendant from any interaction with others involved in the narcotics investigations, whether they be informants or potential defendants. Following the plea allocution, defendant was released on a $125,000 property bond, purportedly to allow him to cooperate in prosecuting other criminals and, in the event he did so, the possibility of receiving a shorter term, as well as the opportunity to put his affairs in order. When defendant twice failed to appear for sentencing, his bail was forfeited, he was indicted for bail jumping in the first degree and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued. Several months later he was arrested, operating under an assumed name. At sentencing, the People asked for concurrent sentences of 8V3 to 25 years, arguing that defendant had breached his part of the plea bargain by failing to appear for sentencing. County Court sentenced defendant accordingly and defendant appeals.\nAt the outset it is noted that the issue raised on appeal, viz., conformity of the sentence to defendant\u2019s plea agreement, was put forth and ruled upon immediately following sentencing and thus is reviewable despite the absence of a formal CPL 440.10 or 440.20 motion (cf., People v Martinez, 125 AD2d 829).\nOn the merits, it is fundamental that a bargained-for sentence may not be exceeded simply because a defendant failed to appear for sentencing as scheduled unless his timely appearance was an explicit or implied condition of the sentencing agreement (People v Sumner, 137 AD2d 891, 892). During defendant\u2019s plea allocution the District Attorney and, even more so, County Court stressed that the slightest infraction of the protection order would free the court to impose a harsher sentence than that agreed upon. By contrast, the only penalty apparently contemplated for failure to appear at sentencing was forfeiture of the bail bond and, necessarily, any criminal prosecution that conduct generated. Since defendant did not breach any of the provisions of the sentencing agreement, County Court erred by exceeding its terms. Under the circumstances, defendant was entitled to have the court adhere to the agreement or offer him an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757). However, since defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and we do not find the sentence bargained for inappropriate, there is no reason not to adhere to it.\nJudgment modified, on the law and the facts, by reducing defendant\u2019s sentence to an indeterminate term of 4 to 12 years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, and, as so modified, affirmed. Casey, J. P., Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., Levine and Mercure, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court modified the County Court's judgment, which had sentenced the defendant to a longer prison term for failing to appear at sentencing after pleading guilty to two counts of third degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. The court ruled that the sentence exceeded the terms of the plea agreement, as the plea did not explicitly condition sentencing on the defendant's appearance. Consequently, the court reduced the sentence to the originally agreed upon 4 to 12 years, to be served concurrently.<|eot_id|>"}

A preplea probation report was prepared, and thereafter, in July 2013, defendant executed a waiver of indictment and consented to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with various counts arising from the incident. On the same date, in full satisfaction of the charges, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and executed an appeal waiver. He was sentenced in accord with his plea agreement to a split sentence of 90 days of incarceration and five years of probation. Defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the denial of his CPL 440.10 motion.\nDefendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as he was erroneously advised that he was eligible for a youthful offender adjudication and as counsel failed to adequately advise him of the deportation consequences of his plea. At the outset, these claims survive defendant\u2019s uncontested appeal waiver only to the extent that they impact the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Livziey, 117 AD3d 1341, 1342 [2014]; People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013]; People v Leonard, 63 AD3d 1278, 1278 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 797 [2009]). Further, although a defendant is ordinarily required to preserve such a claim through an appropriate postallocution motion, preservation is not required where, as here, there is no practical opportunity to do so prior to sentencing (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 183 [2013]; People v Williams, 123 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2014]).\nDefendant was ineligible for youthful offender treatment at the time of the underlying proceedings due to a prior youthful offender adjudication (see CPL 720.10 [2] [c]). As he now contends, it appears from the record that both defense counsel and County Court mistakenly believed that he remained eligible. However, the court clearly and repeatedly advised that he would not be granted a youthful offender adjudication; the court expressly stated this three times prior to the plea allocution. Nonetheless, defendant chose to proceed. In these circumstances, the misapprehension as to defendant\u2019s eligibility was rendered irrevelant by the court\u2019s clear and repeated warnings. Accordingly, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary (see generally People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 383 [2015]; People v Chaney, 72 AD3d 1194, 1196 [2010]).\nDefendant\u2019s claim that he was not warned that he would be deported as a consequence of the plea is also belied by the record. Both prior to and during the course of the plea allocution, and again before pronouncing sentence, County Court expressly advised defendant that a potential consequence of his plea would be his removal from the country; this was described in the initial proceedings as a \u201clikely result.\u201d Thus, defendant was adequately apprised of the potential consequence of deportation that he faced as a result of his plea (see People v Castro, 133 AD3d 986, 987 [2015]; People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 954 [2012], cert denied 568 US \u2014, 133 S Ct 216 [2012]).\nFinally, we find that defendant\u2019s claims are capable of being resolved by reference to the record on direct appeal and, thus, County Court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing (see People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796, 799 [1985]; People v LaPierre, 108 AD3d 945, 946 [2013]).\nPeters, P.J., Rose and Lynch, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment and order are affirmed.\n. Defendant\u2019s arraignment upon the superior court information, plea and sentencing all occurred during a single, uninterrupted proceeding before County Court.\n. It appears that defendant had also conferred with separate counsel relative to his immigration status following his prior conviction and youthful offender designation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree following his guilty plea and upheld the denial of his motion to vacate the conviction. The defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his eligibility for youthful offender status and the deportation consequences of his plea; however, the court found that he was adequately informed of these issues and that his plea was voluntary. The court concluded that the claims could be resolved based on the record, justifying the denial of the CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing.<|eot_id|>"}

She pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison. On appeal, defendant contends that her guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary and that the sentence was harsh and excessive.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw her guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction precludes our review of her contention that her guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see, People v Rojas, 238 AD2d 727, 729; People v Battiste, 238 AD2d 724, 724-725). Nevertheless, were we to consider this claim, we would find it to be without merit. During plea negotiations, the prosecution made it clear that the offer was a plea of guilty to the top count of the indictment with 3 to 9 years in prison and that the recommended sentence might improve if defendant cooperated with the vice squad. No promises were made that the sentence would definitely be reduced. Defendant agreed to the plea bargain as communicated by the prosecution and was advised by County Court that the sentence imposed could be more severe depending upon the outcome of her presentence report. Although defendant expressed her disappointment at sentencing with the fact that the sentence was not reduced because the vice squad evidently did not contact her to obtain her assistance, we do not find that this renders her guilty plea involuntary (see, e.g., People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769, lv denied 89 NY2d 919).\nTo the contrary, our review of the transcript of the plea al locution discloses that County Court explained to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the many rights she would be waiving by doing so. Defendant responded that she understood the court\u2019s admonitions, that she wished to plead guilty of her own free will and was not coerced or threatened into doing so and that she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In view of this, we find that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Battiste, supra, at 725; People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674, lv denied 89 NY2d 927; People v Berezansky, supra, at 769-770). Although defendant\u2019s waiver of her right to appeal precludes her from challenging the sentence (see, People v Galarza, 237 AD2d 817, 818), we nevertheless do not find that it is harsh or excessive given defendant\u2019s criminal history and that she agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain (see, People v Nardi, supra, at 674).\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, White and Yesawich Jr.., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant, who pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, resulting in a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison. The defendant's claims that her plea was not knowing and voluntary were dismissed, as she did not move to withdraw her plea and the court found that she was adequately informed of her rights and the implications of her plea. Additionally, her waiver of the right to appeal prevented challenges to the sentence, which was deemed appropriate given her criminal history and the plea agreement.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, contrary to defendant\u2019s contentions, his combined oral and written waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 339-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; cf. People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011]). The record reflects that defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea deal, was informed that he ordinarily retained the right to appeal his conviction and sentence \u201cto a higher court\u201d but that the People were requiring that he give up that right and, after conferring with counsel throughout the colloquy, defendant accepted this condition of the plea. The record belies his claim that County Court intimated that the waiver was an automatic consequence of his guilty plea, as the court completed its discussion of the trial-related rights automatically forfeited by the plea and then separately addressed the waiver of appeal, while specifying that it was a condition of the People\u2019s offer, without lumping it with the trial rights (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; People v Forget, 136 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 929 [2016]). Defendant then executed a written waiver after reviewing it with counsel that made clear that the waiver of appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by his plea and reflected defendant\u2019s understanding of the waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Given the valid appeal waiver, defendant is precluded from challenging the negotiated sentence as harsh and excessive (see id. at 255-256).\nWhile defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see CPL 220.60 [2]; People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 214, 219-222 [2016]; People v Blair, 136 AD3d 1105, 1106 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1066 [2016]), and he did not make any statement during the plea allocution that triggered the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]). Defendant\u2019s claim that County Court failed to adequately advise him of his constitutional, trial-related Boykin rights (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]) that he was forfeiting by his plea was not preserved despite an opportunity to do so; moreover, the record reflects that he was fully advised and understood the waiver of his trial rights (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 379, 381-384 [2015]). Further, it was not necessary, as he now contends, that he personally recite the elements of the crime, as his affirmative responses to the court\u2019s questions were sufficient (see People v Griffith, 136 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2016]).\nTo the extent that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims implicate the voluntariness of his plea, they survive his appeal waiver, but they are also not properly before us because he never moved to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]). While defendant had unsuccessfully requested the assignment of a new attorney in an earlier proceeding at which he rejected an initial plea offer, he chose at the next appearance to proceed with the plea and did not thereafter move to withdraw his plea. Moreover, defendant failed to articulate good cause to replace assigned counsel, such as a conflict of interest or irreconcilable differences, and we discern no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s denial of this request (see People v Smith, 18 NY3d 588, 592-593 [2012]; People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1264 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). In that regard, defendant\u2019s generalized complaint that counsel had not spent sufficient time with him did not establish good cause for substitution or compel further inquiry under these circumstances (see People v Mitchell, 129 AD3d 1319, 1321 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1041 [2015]). Contrary to his argument, defense counsel did not take a position that was adverse to him or oppose substitution of counsel so as to give rise to a conflict of interest (see People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 967 [2013]; People v Tyler, 130 AD3d 1383, 1385 [2015]). Rather, when the court inquired, counsel properly recounted the steps he and his associate counsel had taken in representing defendant, which was in response to defendant\u2019s request (see id.; see also People v Washington, 25 NY3d 1091, 1095 [2015]; People v Nelson, 7 NY3d 883, 884 [2006]). Thus, were we to address these issues, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation. Defendant\u2019s remaining claims, including those properly raised in his pro se brief, have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.\nGarry, Lynch, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\n. To the extent that defendant\u2019s pro se claims in part concern matters that are outside the record on appeal, they are more appropriately addressed in a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1241 [2016], Iv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]).\n. Defendant\u2019s argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise statutory and constitutional speedy trial claims is unpreserved for our review as it was not raised in County Court. Moreover, his statutory speedy trial claim does not implicate the voluntariness of his plea and therefore does not survive his appeal waiver, and it was forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Archie, 116 AD3d 1165, 1165 [2014]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1267 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]; People v Speranza, 96 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2012]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance following his guilty plea, which included a valid waiver of his right to appeal. The court found that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, and the defendant's claims regarding the voluntariness of his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel were unpreserved for review. Additionally, the court concluded that the defendant had received meaningful representation and dismissed his remaining claims as lacking merit.<|eot_id|>"}

In March 2000, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty, which was accepted in full satisfaction of that indictment, as well as a second indictment charging him with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In April 2000, defendant made a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and coercion by his attorney. After the appointment of new counsel, defendant\u2019s motion was denied and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we note that \u201c[t]he question of whether to permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the sound discretion of the trial court * * * and absent a showing of abuse, that court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed\u201d (People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746, 747). Upon our review of the record, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion. The transcript of the plea allocution demonstrates that the court engaged in a detailed colloquy with defendant and ascertained that he understood the ramifications of his plea and that he did, in fact, commit the crime at issue (see, People v Dawson, 278 AD2d 665, 667-668, lv denied 96 NY2d 799; People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711).\nDefendant\u2019s contention that the plea allocution was deficient because he failed to admit knowledge of the specific location of the drugs inside the apartment is unpersuasive. Defendant acknowledged that he brought the drugs to the apartment and that he retained control over them even though he had given them to his cousin to hold. In response to questioning by County Court, defendant unequivocally admitted to the knowing possession of the drugs with the intent to sell them. Under the circumstances presented, we find that \u201cdefendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea following a sufficient inquiry by County Court, during which time defendant admitted his guilt to the requisite elements of the crime [] charged\u201d (People v Dove, 236 AD2d 644, 644; see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1]).\nSimilarly, we find defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel to be without merit, as the record establishes that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Defendant\u2019s attorney made appropriate motions and successfully negotiated a very favorable plea, resulting in the dismissal of the companion indictment and the imposition of the minimum possible sentence on the possession charge (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404; People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850). Furthermore, defense counsel\u2019s failure to notify the People that defendant wished to testify before the grand jury does not, by itself, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872, 873; People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819, 820). We find defendant\u2019s conclusory allegation that this failure \u201cmay have impacted [his] ability to present a viable defense\u201d to be insufficient to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (see, People v Galleria, 264 AD2d 899, 900, lv denied 94 NY2d 880). Accordingly, we affirm.\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Chemung County, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea. The defendant's motion to withdraw the plea, based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and coercion, was denied as the court found no abuse of discretion; the plea allocution demonstrated that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily admitted to the crime. The court also determined that the defendant received meaningful representation, and his claims regarding counsel's performance were unsubstantiated.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court proved unwilling to impose a sentence of probation given defendant\u2019s eventful criminal history and the fact that he quit his job prior to sentencing and, as a result, defendant withdrew his guilty plea. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty a second time, accepting the commitment of County Court to sentence him to six months in jail to be followed by five years of probation. County Court imposed that sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s argument that County Court coerced him into pleading guilty is unpreserved due to his apparent failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d 1080, 1081 [2014]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d 880, 881 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1040 [2013]). Inasmuch as he made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or negated any elements of the crime to which he pleaded guilty, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d at 1081). In any event, County Court did not engage in coercive conduct by advising defendant of his sentence exposure or warning him that plea negotiations were \u201cfinished\u201d once the case was placed upon the trial calendar (see People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d at 882; People v Rivera, 290 AD2d 730, 731 [2002]).\nLahtinen, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn the appeal concerning EJ Peters, the County Court of Chemung County upheld the conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree after the defendant withdrew his initial guilty plea due to the court's refusal to impose probation.

A plea agreement was reached whereby defendant would plead guilty to a reduced drug charge, to the pending grand larceny charge and to another undetermined charge in satisfaction of the pending investigation. In exchange, he would receive concurrent sentences of eight years to life on the drug conviction, 1\u00bd to 3 years on the grand larceny conviction and 3\u00bd to 7 years on the undetermined charge. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the fourth degree. He was subsequently charged with grand larceny in the third degree stemming from the pending investigation, waived indictment and entered a guilty plea to that charge as well. Although the absence of the Special Prosecutor prevented County Court from sentencing defendant for the crime of grand larceny in the fourth degree, it proceeded to sentence him on the other two charges in accordance with the plea agreement and ordered him to pay over $92,000 in restitution. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction on these two charges.\nInitially, defendant contends that the two-count drug indictment should have been dismissed as defective because it was based upon uncorroborated accomplice testimony before the grand jury. However, a review of the record reveals that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea to a reduced charge in satisfaction of this indictment and, thus, waived this challenge (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 233 [2000]; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 87-88 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 642 [2002]; People v Robertson, 279 AD2d 711, 712 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 805 [2001]). Defendant similarly waived his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the indictment or make other pretrial motions since he does not claim, and there is nothing to suggest, that these alleged failures undermined the voluntariness of his pleas (see People v Porter, 300 AD2d 698, 699 [2002], lv denied 100 NY2d 541 [2003]; People v Lynch, 256 AD2d 651 [1998], lv denied 93 NY2d 1004 [1999]; People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, 793 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 982 [1996]).\nDefendant also contends that the report of the presentence investigation should be physically redacted to remove allegedly unreliable information, most notably a hearsay reference to his having threatened a 14-year-old accomplice to the drug charges. Defendant challenged this and other elements of the presentence report during the sentencing proceeding and County Court agreed not to consider same in its sentencing determination. Although defendant was thus not aggrieved, particularly since he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, he now seeks to have the report redacted to avoid future prejudice in parole and other discretionary determinations.\nThe purpose of a presentence investigation \u201cis to provide the court with the best available information upon which to render an individualized sentence\u201d (People v Perry, 36 NY2d 114, 120 [1975]). To that end, presentence reports should include \u201call information that may have a bearing upon\u201d the court\u2019s sentencing determination (9 NYCRR 350.6; see GPL 390.30; see also People v Whalen, 99 AD2d 883, 884 [1984]), even if such information does not meet the technical rules for admissibility at trial (see People v Perry, supra at 120). Here, defendant was properly afforded an opportunity to challenge the contents of the presentence report (see e.g. People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Perry, supra at 119) and while County Court, in its discretion, opted not to rely on the challenged information in its deliberations, we see no basis for physical redaction of the report.\nLastly, defendant seeks modification of his sentence on the drug conviction, contending that if his sentence were reduced to three years to life he would be able to begin restitution payments sooner. We are unimpressed with this contention. Alternatively, he argues that his sentence on the drug count was so disproportionate to the seriousness of his crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. We disagree. In our view, defendant\u2019s sentence on the drug conviction was not so grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct as to render the sentence unconstitutional (see People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 117 [1975], cert denied 423 US 950 [1975]). Seeing no abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of defendant\u2019s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Varno, 297 AD2d 873, 875 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 565 [2002]; People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, 740-741 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 968 [1999]; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 872 [1999]), we affirm.\nMercure, J.P., Mugglin, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the fourth degree, following a guilty plea as part of a plea agreement. The defendant's claims regarding the indictment's validity and ineffective assistance of counsel were waived due to the voluntary nature of his plea. Additionally, the court found no basis for redacting the presentence investigation report or modifying the sentence, which was deemed not disproportionate to the seriousness of the crimes.<|eot_id|>"}

The agreement included a waiver of appeal and provided that defendant would be sentenced to a prison term not to exceed four years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He was released under supervision pending sentencing and, while released, allegedly violated the condition of his release that he refrain from committing additional crimes or illegal activity by being arrested on drug sale charges. Following several adjournments, the parties reached a renegotiated agreement providing for defendant to receive a prison sentence of seven years followed by three years of postrelease supervision, in full satisfaction of the original plea as well as the new charges. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence, and defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues that County Court erred in imposing what he characterizes as an \u201cenhanced\u201d sentence because he was not warned on the record at the time of his guilty plea of the consequences of being arrested or committing additional crimes while released pending sentencing, and he was not offered an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. While this issue is not precluded by defendant\u2019s earlier appeal waiver, it was not preserved for our review due to his failure to object on this ground at sentencing or move to withdraw his guilty plea on this basis (see People v Nesbitt, 144 AD3d 1329, 1329 [2016]). In any event, the record reflects that the parties renegotiated the terms of the plea agreement to provide that the plea would satisfy all of the new charges in exchange for a higher prison sentence of seven years with three years of postrelease supervi sion. As the higher sentence was not an \u201cenhancement,\u201d but rather the product of a renegotiated agreement to which all parties consented, the court was obligated neither to impose the original agreed-upon sentence nor offer defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea (see People v Dunsmore, 275 AD2d 861, 862-863 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 934 [2000]).

He argued that he wasn't warned about the consequences of committing new crimes while awaiting sentencing and wasn't given a chance to withdraw his plea, but this claim was not preserved for review since he did not object at sentencing. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that the new sentence was part of a renegotiated plea agreement and not an enhancement.<|eot_id|>"}

He was accepted into the drug treatment court program in August 2012 and, as such, was placed on interim probation supervision. Defendant was sanctioned for failing to comply with the provisions of the treatment contract, and further violated the terms of his interim probation on two occasions. The second of those probation violations, in January 2013, arose when he absconded from the halfway house where he was residing and failed to report to his probation officer. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years, to be followed by postrelease supervision of two years.\nDefendant now appeals, arguing that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Considering defendant\u2019s prior criminal history and poor conduct while on interim probation, as well as the fact that he could have received a much more substantial prison term, \u201cwe find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice\u201d (People v Miller, 113 AD3d 935, 935-936 [2014], lv denied 22 NY3d 1201 [2014]; see People v Aljerari, 109 AD3d 1049, 1050 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1038 [2013]).\nPeters, PJ., Stein, Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Clinton County convicted the defendant of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance and sentenced him to five years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision after he violated the terms of his interim probation.

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDevine, J.\nAppeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 8, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered January 8, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.\nDefendant was originally charged in an indictment with promoting prison contraband in the first degree. Although County Court dismissed the indictment on the basis that defendant had not received proper grand jury notice, this Court reversed that order and ordered that the indictment be reinstated (94 AD3d 1334, 1334-1335 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 968 [2012]). Following reinstatement of the indictment, but prior to its resolution, police officers responding to a domestic dispute at defendant\u2019s apartment found over 500 milligrams of cocaine. Defendant ultimately waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree by superior court information.\nDefendant then pleaded guilty to attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the indictment and superior court information and waived his right to appeal both convictions. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of IV2 to 3 years for the prison contraband charge and IV2 years for the controlled substance charge, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He was released prior to sentencing and, while on release, he was arrested in Orange County. County Court thereafter found defendant in violation of a condition of his release and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an enhanced prison term of 2 to 4 years on the prison contraband conviction and four years in prison on the criminal possession of a controlled substance conviction, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, with the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, although County Court should have more thoroughly distinguished the right to appeal from the rights forfeited upon pleading guilty, the detailed written waivers of the right to appeal executed by defendant and his counsel acknowledged defendant\u2019s separate and distinct right to appeal, confirmed that he had discussed the waivers and their consequences with counsel and affirmed that he was voluntarily waiving the right. County Court confirmed that defendant understood the waivers and that he did not need any further time to discuss them with counsel. Under these circumstances, the record reflects that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal his convictions and sentences was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1290-1291 [2010]). In light of his valid appeal waiver, defendant\u2019s challenge to County Court\u2019s suppression ruling is precluded (see People v Morrison, 106 AD3d 1201, 1202 [2013]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094 [2013]).\nDefendant\u2019s contention that his guilty plea to attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary \u2014 which survives his appeal waiver \u2014 is nonetheless unpreserved as the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]; People v Hare, 110 AD3d 1117, 1117 [2013]). Further, while we agree that defendant\u2019s statements prior to the plea colloquy that the cell phone in question was not \u201cdangerous contraband\u201d reveal some equivocation as to an essential element of the crime to which he later pleaded guilty (see Penal Law \u00a7 205.25 [2]; People v Pagan, 36 AD3d 1163, 1164-1165 [2007]), we are satisfied that, during the ensuing discussion with County Court, defendant was properly informed and understood that, if he went to trial, it would be up to the jury to determine whether or not the cell phone was dangerous contraband (see People v Green, 119 AD3d 23, 26-27 [2014]). Defendant did not raise the issue thereafter, including during the plea colloquy itself, and the record reflects that, following this discussion, defendant knowingly chose to accept a favorable plea deal rather than risk conviction following a trial. Accordingly, inasmuch as the record demonstrates that defendant\u2019s concerns were clarified and his plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Goodell, 104 AD3d 1026, 1026 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1138 [2014]; People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).\nFinally, defendant argues that County Court erred in impos ing an enhanced sentence. We agree. Although this issue is not precluded by his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved inasmuch as he failed to object to the enhanced sentence or make an appropriate motion (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d 1186, 1186 [2012]; People v Lindsey, 80 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2011]; People v Donnelly, 80 AD3d 797, 798 [2011]; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d 1453, 1454 [2009]). Despite this failure to preserve the issue, we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action.\nA sentencing court may not impose an enhanced sentence unless it has informed the defendant of specific conditions that the defendant must abide by or risk such enhancement, or give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his or her plea before the enhanced sentence is imposed (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1186; People v Lindsey, 80 AD3d at 1006; People v Becker, 80 AD3d 795, 796 [2011]; People v Fisher, 76 AD3d 1122, 1122 [2010]; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d at 1454). Here, County Court enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence due to defendant\u2019s arrest while on release pending sentencing. However, the record reflects that defendant was never warned that County Court would not be bound by its sentencing commitment if he were arrested while out on release. Consequently, County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence without first providing defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1186-1187; People v Becker, 80 AD3d at 796-797; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d at 1454; People v Armstead, 52 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]). Accordingly, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and remit the matter to County Court to impose the agreed-upon sentence or give defendant the option of withdrawing his plea before imposing the enhanced sentence (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1187; People v Fisher, 76 AD3d at 1122).\nPeters, EJ., Lahtinen, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgments are modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentences imposed; matters remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.\nContrary to the People\u2019s contention, defendant\u2019s promise to County Court that he would not \u201cget in trouble\u201d if he were released is not \u201can explicit and objective\u201d condition that could provide a basis for the enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence (People v Becker, 80 AD3d at 796).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reviewed and modified the sentences of a defendant convicted of attempted promoting prison contraband and criminal possession of a controlled substance, both resulting from guilty pleas. The court found that the County Court erred in imposing enhanced sentences due to the defendant's arrest while on release, as he was not properly informed that such an arrest could lead to an enhanced sentence without the opportunity to withdraw his plea. The case is remitted for further proceedings to either impose the original agreed-upon sentence or allow the defendant to withdraw his plea.<|eot_id|>"}

At the plea proceeding, the prosecutor explained that, pursuant to the plea bargain, \u201cthe sentence would be decided at the time of sentencing after the Court has the Presentence Investigation Report and any other information that the People and defense submit.\u201d Defense counsel advised County Court that \u201cthe proposed plea bargain that [the] District Attorney * * * has placed on the record is consistent with what we have previously discussed.\u201d\nIn contrast, at sentencing the prosecutor described the plea bargain as including an agreement that the sentence would be a prison term of eight years to life \u201cunless the defendant provided valuable cooperation and gave the court reason to give him a lesser sentence.\u201d Contending that defendant had not provided the required \u201cvaluable cooperation,\u201d the prosecutor urged that the sentence be eight years to life. Arguing that the police had failed to contact defendant with regard to the \u201cvaluable cooperation\u201d condition and that there were various factors which warranted leniency, defense counsel sought a lesser term of imprisonment. Concluding that defendant should be sentence \u201cas agreed,\u201d County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years to life. Defendant appeals, claiming, inter alia, that it was impermissible to hold him to the terms of an alleged plea agreement which was not placed on the record.\nAlthough defendant executed a written waiver of the right to appeal, he was not advised on the record of the maximum sentence he faced prior to executing that waiver and, therefore, the waiver does not encompass his right to challenge his sentence on appeal (see, People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513). Turning to the merits, we conclude that under the circumstances presented here, County Court erred in relying on the terms of an agreement which were not placed on the record. The Court of Appeals has \u201crepeatedly emphasized the necessity of placing all promises on the record, in order to assure the continued validity and usefulness of the plea bargaining process in our criminal justice system\u201d (Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116, 120). Thus, \u201c[i]t is a settled rule of law in this State that off-the-record promises made in the plea bargaining process will not be recognized where they are flatly contradicted by the record, either by the existence of some on-the-record promise whose terms are inconsistent with those later urged or by the placement on the record of a statement by the pleading defendant that no other promises have been made to induce his guilty plea\u201d (id. at 120; see, People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169, 173-174).\nIn this case, the claimed off-the-record agreement fixing a specific sentence subject to reduction if defendant provided \u201cvaluable cooperation\u201d is inconsistent with the parties\u2019 representations on the record of the plea proceeding that the sentence would be determined by County Court at the time of sentencing based upon the court\u2019s review of the presentence report and other material submitted by the People and the defense. At sentencing, a dispute arose over what was required of defendant to comply with the \u201cvaluable cooperation\u201d condition of the off-the-record agreement, underscoring\u2014once again\u2014\u201cthe need to have all relevant terms of a plea agreement * * * placed upon the record\u201d (People v Danny G., supra at 174). Thus, County Court should not have accorded any weight to the alleged off-the-record agreement in sentencing defendant, (see, People v Huertas, 85 NY2d 898, 899; People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 974, lv denied 88 NY2d 1024; People v Salvagni, 199 AD2d 680). The appropriate remedy is to vacate the sentence and remit the matter for resentencing before a different judge.\nMercure, J.P., Peters, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Clinton County for resentencing before a different judge; and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court vacated the defendant's sentence of eight years to life for criminal sale of a controlled substance, determining that the County Court improperly relied on an off-the-record plea agreement that was inconsistent with the on-the-record representations made during the plea proceeding. The court emphasized the necessity of documenting all plea agreement terms to ensure the integrity of the plea bargaining process, and remitted the case for resentencing before a different judge.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. To the extent that defendant challenges the valid ity of his appeal waiver, the plea colloquy and the written waiver executed in open court demonstrate that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]; People v Merrill, 123 AD3d 1339, 1339 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 970 [2015]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contention, that his plea was involuntary, survives his appeal waiver but is not preserved for our review, as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 935 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). Further, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not implicated here, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Kormos, 126 AD3d 1039, 1040 [2015]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Rose and Clark, JJ., concur.

Two subsequent defense attorneys moved to vacate the plea prior to sentencing. After denying these motions, County Court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain.\nDuring the plea colloquy, when asked whether he sold drugs to an undercover officer, defendant stated, \u201cMost was set up through another guy. He called me up, told me that his friend wanted this stuff. I went and got it for him basically. * * * I never made no profit from it.\u201d These statements raised the possibility of an agency defense.\nIf the agency defense applied here, defendant would not have been culpable in the sale of controlled substances (see People v Feldman, 50 NY2d 500, 503 [1980]). Agency is not an affirmative defense, but rather \u201cmay negate the existence of an essential element of the crime \u2014 the \u2018sale\u2019 \u201d (People v Roche, 45 NY2d 78, 86 [1978], cert denied 439 US 958 [1978]). Where the colloquy fails to establish all the elements of the crime, casts significant doubt on the defendant\u2019s guilt, or raises the possibility of a defense which may negate an essential element, the court is put on notice of such situation and must take steps to ensure a valid plea (see People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]; People v Munck, 278 AD2d 662, 663 [2000]). Where facts implicating the agency defense are raised, a court may not accept the plea without first conducting further inquiry to assure that the defendant is aware of the possible defense and decides to plead despite its existence, thus assuring that the waiver of the defense is intelligent and voluntary (see People v Mosher, 222 AD2d 1034, 1035 [1995]; People v Davis, 176 AD2d 1236, 1237 [1991]; see also People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 677 [1999]).\nHere, defendant\u2019s statements during the plea colloquy indicated a possible agency defense. County Court erred in accepting his plea without inquiring further to determine defendant\u2019s awareness of that defense and whether he chose to plead guilty anyway. Given the fact that the plea must be vacated on this ground, we decline to address the remaining issues.\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, guilty plea vacated, and matter remitted to the County Court of Fulton County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reversed the judgment of the County Court of Fulton County, which had accepted the defendant's guilty plea for four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance. The court found that during the plea colloquy, the defendant's statements suggested a potential agency defense that was not adequately explored by the court, leading to the conclusion that the plea was not valid. Consequently, the court vacated the plea and remitted the matter for further proceedings.<|eot_id|>"}

Also, there was no showing that the prosecution aided police informant Jerome Powell in his leaving this jurisdiction, and, furthermore, the prosecution had no duty to produce him at trial (People v Fowler, 46 AD2d 838). As to defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s summation warrants a reversal of this conviction, and there is nothing inconsistent in the jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty and not guilty to the two charges of criminal sale against defendant because the record reveals significant differences in the proof offered on each charge. Judgment affirmed. Sweeney, J. P., Kane, Main, Larkin and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance was denied, with the court affirming the judgment and sentencing of the defendant to an indeterminate prison term of five years to life. The court found the defendant's constitutional challenges and claims regarding the prosecution's handling of a police informant to be without merit, and stated that the prosecutor's summation did not warrant a reversal. The jury's differing verdicts on the charges were deemed consistent based on the evidence presented.<|eot_id|>"}

In March 2014, defendant, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement that required her to, among other things, execute a waiver of appeal, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of seven years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, while the negotiated plea agreement required defendant to execute a waiver of appeal, our review of the record reveals that County Court failed to explain the significance of an appeal waiver or convey that it is \u201cseparate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Bates, 146 AD3d 1075, 1075 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d 1250, 1250 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). Although defendant acknowledged that she understood that the plea agreement required her to execute a waiver of appeal whereby she would waive certain appellate rights, the record neither contains a written waiver of appeal signed by defendant nor reflects that any inquiry was made as to whether she had read such a waiver and understood it (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the waiver of appeal was invalid and does not preclude defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or her challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed.\nDefendant argues that her guilty plea was involuntary because it was induced by unfulfilled promises regarding the length of her sentence and that she would be admitted into a correctional facility wherein she could have given birth to her child and purportedly remained with that child for 18 months thereafter. While \u201c[a] guilty plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored\u201d (People v Collier, 22 NY3d 429, 433 [2013] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], cert denied 573 US \u2014, 134 S Ct 2730 [2014]; see People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Roberts, 293 AD2d 916, 917 [2002]), the record does not establish any of defendant\u2019s allegations. Defendant indicated that she understood the terms of the plea agreement\u2014which did not specify the correctional facility to which she would be assigned or indicate whether she would receive additional confinement for having violated parole\u2014and requested that County Court adhere to its terms. Defendant also expressed that, among other things, she had been given enough time to discuss her plea with her counsel and her family members, that she was voluntarily giving up her trial-related rights and that she understood that she would be allowed to withdraw her plea if County Court decided to deviate from the proposed sentence after reviewing the pre-sentence report. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the minutes of the plea colloquy amply refute any claim of off-the-record promises allegedly made to defendant that are not entitled to judicial recognition (see Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116, 120 [1982]; People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 526 [1978]; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d at 244; People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; People v Crowell, 130 AD3d 1362, 1363 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1144 [2016], cert denied 580 US \u2014, 137 S Ct 1333 [2017]). In addition, to the extent that defendant\u2019s contentions are based upon off-the-record communications between defendant and counsel or her parole officer, they are not properly addressed in this direct appeal (see People v Fairweather, 147 AD3d 1153, 1154 [2017]; People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]).\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, even if we were to agree with defendant\u2019s contention that her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to advise her of or request judicial diversion under the program created by CPL article 216, whether an eligible defendant will be offered judicial diversion pursuant to that article remains within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and defendant is not automatically entitled to judicial diversion (see People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; cf. People v Pittman, 140 AD3d 989, 989 [2016]; People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1383 [2013]). Moreover, the record reflects that defendant\u2019s counsel negotiated a favorable plea agreement whereby defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an 11-count indictment and in exchange for the People\u2019s promise to not bring additional charges for the discovery of narcotics within defendant\u2019s home when she was arrested by parole officers. Accordingly, in light of the foregoing and defendant\u2019s express acknowledgment during the plea colloquy that she was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation, we conclude that defendant received meaningful representation and that nothing in the record before us casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see People v Ramos, 135 AD3d 1234, 1235 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 935 [2016]; People v Lord, 128 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2015]; People v Ramey, 123 AD3d 1290, 1290-1291 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 953 [2015]).\nAlthough, as noted above, defendant\u2019s challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is not precluded by the invalid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d at 1250), we do not find that the sentence is harsh or excessive. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s purported eligibility for judicial diversion, as well as her age, mental health issues and then-pregnancy, County Court imposed the sentence that defendant expressly agreed to receive in exchange for her guilty plea. Thus, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Ramirez, 98 AD3d 1168, 1168 [2012]; People v Lasanta, 89 AD3d 1324, 1324 [2011]; People v Jones, 257 AD2d 920, 920 [1999]).\nGarry, J.P., Egan Jr., Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nPremised upon the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant moved to vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence pursuant to CPL 440.10. County Court denied that motion, and this Court declined permission for defendant to appeal therefrom (2015 NY Slip Op 92470RJ] [2015]). Thereafter, defendant moved this Court to supplement the record in this appeal to include, among other things, defendant\u2019s postjudgment motion, and this Court also denied that motion (2016 NY Slip Op 78475[U] [2016]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following her guilty plea. Despite the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that her plea was involuntary due to unfulfilled promises regarding her sentence and incarceration, the court found no evidence supporting these claims and determined that the defendant had received meaningful representation. The court also held that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive, aligning with the terms of the plea agreement.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant, claiming that he did not waive his right to appeal his sentence, contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive given, inter alia, the strides he has made with his substance abuse problem. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal included his waiver to appeal the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909; People v Spanos, 224 AD2d 732, 733; People v Burk, 181 AD2d 74, lv denied 80 NY2d 927). In any event, were we to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s assertion that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we would find that the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion to warrant modification of the sentence imposed by County Court, especially in light of defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history (see, People v Spanos, supra; People v Henry, 222 AD2d 932, 936, lv denied 88 NY2d 848).\nCrew III, J.

Following plea-bargaining negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced as indicated at the time of his plea and in accord with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 8 years. However, defendant\u2019s maximum sentence should have been at least nine years (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]) with a minimum of one half of that (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [4] [b]). The sentence defendant did in fact receive was therefore illegal and, by operation of law, cannot stand (see, People v Shelton, 100 AD2d 775). Since the sentence promised at the time of defendant\u2019s plea of guilty cannot be fulfilled, thus denying defendant the benefit of the plea bargain, he is entitled to vacatur of the sentence and should be given the opportunity to move to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Shelton, supra; People v Rodriguez, 70 AD2d 509; People v Miller, 38 AD2d 745, 746).\nJudgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this court\u2019s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.

Defendant was represented by the Public Defender\u2019s office and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. Thereafter, by letter, the Public Defender\u2019s office requested that County Court assign new counsel to represent defendant due to an unspecified conflict of interest but, following a letter from the District Attorney, County Court sent a letter to both sides reflecting that the request had been withdrawn. Defendant, represented by an Assistant Public Defender, proceeded to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and any charges which could be brought against him as of the date of the plea proceedings; he also waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 3V2 to 7 years in prison, and now appeals.\nInitially, defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest is foreclosed by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, as this claim is not premised upon the alleged involuntariness of his plea (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003]; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]; compare People v Abar, 290 AD2d 592 [2002], affd 99 NY2d 406 [2003]). Moreover, \u201cdefendant\u2019s failure to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes him from raising it\u201d (People v Camp, supra at 630; see People v King, supra at 662).\nIn any event, considering this claim, we find it to be without merit. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon a conflict of interest, the \u201cdefendant must demonstrate that \u2018the conduct of his defense was in fact affected by the operation of the conflict of interest, or that the conflict \u2018operated on\u2019 counsel\u2019s representation\u201d (People v Longtin, 92 NY2d 640, 644 [1998], cert denied 526 US 1114 [1999], quoting People v Alicea, 61 NY2d 23, 31 [1983]; see People v Harris, 99 NY2d 202, 210 [2002]). Here, the basis for the Public Defender\u2019s request for the assignment of new counsel is not in the record, although we can deduce that it was based upon a perceived conflict of interest arising from its representation of the individual with whom defendant allegedly acted in concert in selling heroin to undercover police. Following a letter from the District Attorney stating that this individual had not been charged and was represented by another attorney, the Public Defender\u2019s office withdrew its request, evidently because it was not representing the other individual. The only development in the case at this point had been the entry of defendant\u2019s not guilty plea. The record discloses that thereafter, the Public Defender\u2019s office made appropriate motions, engaged in proper pretrial discovery and secured a favorable plea bargain. Therefore, although it would have been preferable if the issue had been addressed and resolved on the record, we conclude that no conflict is demonstrated, the conflict alleged did not inhibit counsel\u2019s meaningful representation of defendant, and County Court was not required to conduct a further inquiry (see People v Harris, supra at 211-212).\nMoreover, defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal also precludes his challenge to the severity of the sentence (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 661 [2002]; People v Buckner, 274 AD2d 832, 833-834 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 904 [2000]). In any event, no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant modification of this negotiated sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Allen, 301 AD2d 874, 875-876 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]; People v Young, 301 AD2d 754, 755 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 634 [2003]).\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of all counts contained in both indictments. Defendant\u2019s plea agreement was conditioned on defendant cooperating with the Cortland County Drug Task Force and in exchange for his cooperation, he would receive 2 to 6 years in prison for each count to be served concurrently. However, defendant was informed before accepting the plea agreement that unless he fully cooperated with the Drug Task Force he would not receive concurrent prison sentences. Prior to sentencing, the Drug Task Force informed County Court that defendant had failed to cooperate. Therefore, County Court imposed a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison for each count to be served consecutively.\nDefendant appeals his sentence contending that it was harsh and excessive. In light of the seriousness and extensiveness of defendant\u2019s crimes and the fact that defendant was fully apprised that he would not be sentenced to concurrent sentences if he failed to cooperate with the Drug Task Force, the sentence was not harsh and excessive (see, People v Fernandez, 263 AD2d 673, lv denied 94 NY2d 822).

On January 14, 1975 defendant and his brother Rafael were indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Specifically, the indictment charged that they sold four tinfoil packets containing heroin to one Anne Didrich, also known as Anne Benton (herein Anne). Rafael subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge. A severance was then granted. Defendant was tried and convicted. He received an indeterminate sentence of three years to life. Basically, it was defendant\u2019s contention at trial that Rafael was the guilty party and defendant was not involved. To substantiate this, Rafael testified, admitting this guilt and exonerating defendant. The latter testified in his own behalf. Anne testified for the prosecution and related a contrary story which implicated defendant. The conflicting stories presented questions of fact and credibility which the jury resolved against defendant. On this appeal defendant urges several errors. We have examined all of his arguments and conclude they lack merit. No specific comment by us is required, other than to note that, considering the record in its entirety, we are of the view that defendant received a fair trial and there is ample evidence to sustain the verdict of guilty.

On appeal, defendant claims that County Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea since the court reneged on the original sentencing agreement. We disagree. At the plea hearing, County Court informed defendant that if he did not appear for sentencing \"all deals are off\u201d. In view of defendant\u2019s failure to comply with an explicit condition of the plea agreement, we find that County Court was free to impose a harsher sentence and did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Radek, 202 AD2d 847, lv denied 84 NY2d 939; People v Webster, 202 AD2d 710).\nMercure, J.

Defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of two years to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision between IV2 and 3 years. He declined to withdraw his plea after learning that he did not qualify as a predicate felon, but that his sentence would not be reduced. He argued, however, that alternatives to a prison sentence or, at the very least, a shorter sentence should be considered. County Court imposed a prison sentence of two years to be followed by postrelease supervision of two years, and defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s mistaken belief that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender when he entered his guilty plea did not render his appeal waiver invalid and, to the extent that he also challenges the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea, the record does not reflect that he preserved that claim for our review by moving to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Ortiz, 69 AD3d 966, 967-968 [2010]; People v Dean, 52 AD3d 1308, 1308-1309 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 736 [2008]). Defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver bars his further claims that the sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Griffin, 100 AD3d 1153, 1154 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1011 [2013]) and that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to have him evaluated for inclusion in the judicial diversion program (see CPL art 216; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; People v Ivey, 79 AD3d 1531, 1532 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 859 [2011]).\nSpain, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

Although the negotiated plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to a 21/2-year prison term with two years of postrelease supervision, County Court advised defendant that if he was arrested prior to sentencing, he would be subject to an enhanced sentence. Defendant was thereafter arrested on two separate occasions prior to the date of his sentencing and, as a result, County Court sentenced him to 4V2 years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, asserting that County Court erred in failing to inquire about the arrests prior to sentencing him. We agree.\n\u201c \u2018When an issue is raised concerning the validity of [a] postplea charge or there is a denial of any involvement in the underlying crime, the court must conduct an inquiry at which the defendant has an opportunity to show that the arrest is without foundation\u2019 \u201d (People v Curtis, 278 AD2d 664, 665 [2000], quoting People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993], cert denied sub nom. Maietta v Artuz, 519 US 964 [1996]; see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]; People v Naranjo, 89 NY2d 1047, 1049 [1997]). While the nature and extent of the inquiry is discretionary, it \u201cmust be of sufficient depth ... so that the court can be satisfied\u2014not of defendant\u2019s guilt of the new criminal charge but of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest on that charge\u201d (People v Outley, supra at 713). Here, when given the opportunity to comment on the arrests, defendant offered exculpatory explanations, claiming that one arrest was malicious and that he was not present at the time and location of the alleged offense underlying the second arrest. Despite these contentions by defendant, which served as a challenge to the validity of the arrests, County Court sentenced him to an enhanced prison term without further inquiry. Accordingly, inasmuch as County Court failed to ascertain whether there was a legitimate basis for the postplea arrests, we must remit this matter for a new sentencing hearing in accordance with this decision (see People v McClemore, 276 AD2d 32, 35-37 [2000]; cf. People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1050-1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]).\nThe People\u2019s remaining argument has been reviewed and found to be lacking in merit.\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

In the course of plea negotiations, it came to light that defendant had a prior conviction for the federal crime of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, and he was informed that, as a result, he could be sentenced, as a violent predicate offender, to a prison term of 15 years on each count of the indictment if found guilty. Subsequently, defendant pleaded guilty, as a second violent felony offender, to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a negotiated sentence of four years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Thereafter, having failed to appear for sentencing as originally scheduled, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of six years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. In January 2010, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction or, in the alternative, to set aside the sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. He now appeals by permission.\nWe agree with defendant\u2019s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion without a hearing. Initially, we reject the People\u2019s assertion that defendant is precluded from seeking to vacate his judgment of conviction through a CPL 440.10 motion as a result of his failure to raise such grounds on direct appeal. Defendant\u2019s primary claim is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to realize and point out his true sentencing status. Because this claim is based on matters outside of the record, a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 is the appropriate procedural vehicle to raise this challenge (see People v Mobley, 59 AD3d 741, 742 [2009], Iv denied 12 NY3d 856 [2009]; People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 632 [2003], Iv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; People v Reynolds, 309 AD2d 976, 976 [2003]; see generally People v Pendelton, 81 AD3d 1037, 1038-1039 [2011]).\nHere, the People and defense counsel conducted plea negotiations and entered into a plea agreement, and County Court rendered a sentence, under the assumption that, based upon his 2000 federal conviction, defendant was a violent predicate felon. However, the elements of 18 USC \u00a7 922 (g) (8), the federal statute under which defendant was convicted, do not accord with any felony under New York law, and the People have failed to enumerate a state penal statute under which defendant could be considered a predicate felon (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [i]; People v Yancy, 86 NY2d 239, 247 [1995]; People v Muniz, 74 NY2d 464, 467-468 [1989]; People v Mosby, 78 AD3d 1371, 1374 [2010], Iv denied 16 NY3d 834 [2011]; People v Perron, 273 AD2d 549, 550 [2000]). Therefore, we find a question as to whether counsel provided inadequate legal assistance by failing to detect and correct the mistaken impression of defendant\u2019s sentencing status (see People v Thomson, 46 AD3d 939, 940 [2007], Iv denied 9 NY3d 1039 [2008]; People v Garcia, 19 AD3d 17, 20-21 [2005]). Moreover, were defendant not subject to be sentenced as a violent predicate felon, his current sentence of six years in prison is illegal (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [2] [a] [ii]). Under these circumstances, defendant raised an issue sufficient to require a hearing as to whether counsel\u2019s representation was deficient and, if so, whether defendant was prejudiced thereby (see People v Mobley, 59 AD3d at 742; People v Garcia, 19 AD3d at 18; People v Reynolds, 309 AD2d at 977; People v Perron, 273 AD2d at 550; People v Miller, 144 AD2d 867, 868 [1988]).\nRose, Lahtinen, Malone Jr. and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn April 2008, the defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, believing he was facing a potential 15-year sentence as a violent predicate felon due to a prior federal conviction. However, the court later determined that the federal conviction did not qualify as a violent felony under New York law, leading to an illegal sentence of six years. The appellate court reversed the County Court's denial of the defendant's motion to vacate the conviction without a hearing, stating that there was sufficient grounds to investigate whether the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel related to his sentencing status.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nOn or about June 28, 1989, the defendant was charged with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree in connection with the sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer. On December 4, 1989, after lengthy plea negotiations in which the defendant endeavored to secure the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation for a sentence of lifetime probation, he agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in exchange for a commitment to impose sentence of an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment, the minimum period of incarceration permitted upon a conviction of a class A-II felony.\nDuring the plea allocution, the defendant admitted that he had, while acting with another, sold a quantity of cocaine in excess of two ounces to an undercover police officer. The defendant\u2019s attorney asked the court to defer formal acceptance of the plea because he wished to have his client continue cooperating with law enforcement authorities, and wanted to leave open the possibility that the District Attorney would recommend a sentence of lifetime probation. Since all believed that formal acceptance of the plea required the revocation of the defendant\u2019s bail status pursuant to CPL 530.40 (3), the court, with the consent of the People, agreed to defer formal acceptance of the plea in order to give the defendant the opportunity to continue providing assistance to the police. The matter was adjourned to January 9, 1990, to allow the People to monitor the level of assistance provided by the defendant.\nOn January 9, 1990, the District Attorney advised the court and the defendant that the level of cooperation had been insufficient and would not result in a recommendation of lifetime probation (see, People v D\u2019Amico, 147 Misc 2d 731, 734). At this time, the defendant requested an adjournment to put his affairs in order but did not move to vacate his plea. Prior to sentencing on July 2, 1990, the undercover officer involved in the sale with the defendant was murdered. The defendant then took the position that a valid plea was never entered and that he was entitled to a trial of the original charges. Alternatively, he moved to vacate the plea in the interests of justice. By decision and order dated May 17, 1990, the court denied the motion, concluding that a valid plea had been offered. The plea was thereupon formally accepted. On July 2, 1990, the court imposed sentence in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v D\u2019Amico, supra).\nThe defendant waived his claim that there was a defect in the proceedings, since the formal acceptance of his plea was deferred at his specific request (cf., People v D\u2019Amico, 150 AD2d 276, 279-280, affd 76 NY2d 877). In any event, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the plea was validly offered at the plea allocution on December 4, 1989. At that time, the defendant expressly agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree based upon a commitment to impose sentence of an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment. At his lawyer\u2019s request, formal acceptance of the plea was deferred so that the defendant might remain at liberty in the hope that he would be able to assist the police in such a significant manner that a sentence of lifetime proba tion would be recommended. The court\u2019s action in temporarily deferring formal acceptance of the plea was for the limited purpose of giving the defendant the additional time at liberty that he sought. It did not vitiate the validity and enforceability of the plea agreement. The defendant received the benefit of the promises that were made on December 4, 1989. After the defendant failed to meet the condition for imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation, the court properly acted to formally accept his plea, and thereupon to impose a sentence of three years to life imprisonment in accordance with the original plea agreement (cf., People v Gordon, 162 AD2d 343). The court properly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Jones, 44 NY2d 76, 81, cert denied 439 US 846). Kunzeman, J. P., Sullivan, Eiber and Ritter, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOn June 28, 1989, the defendant was charged with selling and possessing cocaine but later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a potential sentence of lifetime probation.

The court denied the defendant's motion to vacate the plea, affirming its validity and the enforceability of the plea agreement.<|eot_id|>"}

While being held pending sentencing, however, defendant was involved in an incident at the Schenectady County Jail which resulted in his pleading guilty to the crime of assault in the third degree. Consequently, County Court indicated at sentencing that it was no longer willing to impose the sentence agreed to and gave defendant an opportunity to either withdraw his plea or accept a sentence of 2Vz to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant ultimately agreed to the increased sentence and now appeals, contending that County Court erred in failing to abide by the terms of the original plea agreement and that the sentence is harsh and excessive.\nWe affirm. A sentencing court retains its discretion to impose an appropriate sentence until the time of sentencing (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757; People v Walker, 187 AD2d 909; People v Wade, 153 AD2d 969). Defendant\u2019s additional criminal activity while awaiting sentencing clearly provided County Court with sufficient reason to depart from the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v Wade, supra). Given that defendant does not allege that he detrimentally relied upon the original sentencing agreement and was offered and rejected the opportunity to withdraw his plea, we cannot find that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant (see, People v Schultz, supra). Nor can we find any reason to disturb the sentence imposed in light of defendant\u2019s plea agreement, his prior criminal record and his conduct while awaiting sentencing (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nWeiss, P.

After his release on parole, he was again arrested and pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and was returned to prison. Defendant subsequently moved to be resentenced pursuant to CPL 440.46, but was released on parole prior to a determination being made on his application. County Court dismissed his application on the basis that defendant was ineligible to apply for resentencing because of his status as a parole violator and the fact that he was no longer incarcerated. Defendant now appeals.\nAs the People concede, reversal is required. Defendant\u2019s status as a parole violator does not preclude County Court from considering his application (see People v Paulin, 17 NY3d 238, 244 [2011]), although it may be taken into account by the court when determining whether or not to grant the application (see id.; People v Devivo, 87 AD3d 794, 796 [2011]). Further, insofar as defendant was in custody when he applied for resentencing, the fact that he has subsequently been released does not render his application moot (see People v Santiago, 17 NY3d 246, 248-249 [2011]).

Upon review of the record, we find that it is not.

The record also reflected that, as a result of defendant\u2019s plea, his girlfriend, an unindicted coconspirator, would be permitted to plead to a crime that would allow a split sentence of imprisonment and probation. During the plea, defendant acknowledged that he was waiving the right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant appeals, claiming that his plea was coerced and that his sentence is excessive.\n\u201cAlthough defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal does not in and of itself preclude appellate review of the voluntariness of his plea * * * the issue was not preserved by a motion to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction * * *\u201d (People v Bolden, 287 AD2d 883, 883, lv denied 97 NY2d 654 [citations omitted]). Nor does the record contain anything which would trigger the exception to the preservation rule by casting significant doubt on the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666), even in light of the special concern required by the connection between defendant\u2019s plea and the leniency accorded to his girlfriend (see, People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536). With regard to defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of the sentence, it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733). In any event, the record discloses neither an abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed nor any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v O\u2019Byrne, 262 AD2d 867, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024).\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

During the plea colloquy, as well as at sentencing, defendant indicated that he recalled being adjudicated a youthful offender on the conviction cited in the prior felony offender information filed against him. No information regarding youthful offender treatment was contained in the documentation obtained by the People. Although County Court informed defendant that he was entitled to a hearing on the matter (see CPL 400.21), defendant indicated his desire to proceed with sentencing and admitted the prior felony conviction. Defendant thereafter was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 3 to 6 years.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender when County Court failed to conduct a hearing pursuant to CPL 400.21. Initially, we note that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude his challenge to the legality of the sentence (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Nevertheless, we find defendant\u2019s contention to be without merit. The record clearly establishes that defendant knowingly waived his right to a predicate felony hearing and then admitted to the prior felony (see People v Jones, 185 AD2d 470, 472 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 975 [1992]; People v Williams, 106 AD2d 786, 787 [1984]).\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Peters, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur.

At the plea colloquy defendant admitted that on February 5, 1998 he possessed heroin and cocaine weighing in excess of two ounces. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to four years to life in prison. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s primary contention is that count one of the indictment\u2014the charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty\u2014was duplicitous and/or jurisdictionally defective. That count alleged that on the date of his arrest, defendant \u201cknowingly and unlawfully possessed one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing a narcotic drug, to wit, heroin and cocaine, and said preparations, compounds, mixtures and substances were of an aggregate weight of two ounces or more\u201d. Defendant contends\u2014as he did in a preplea motion to dismiss\u2014that this count is defective because it specifies that he possessed more than one type of a controlled substance, i.e., heroin and cocaine, and thus it illegally aggregated the weight of two narcotic substances to satisfy the weight requirement for this crime.\nIt is well settled that a defendant\u2019s entry of a guilty plea constitutes a forfeiture of challenges to nonjurisdictional defects in an accusatory instrument while jurisdictional defects therein are not waived (see, People v George, 261 AD2d 711, 712-713, lv denied 93 NY2d 1018; see also, People v Beattie, 80 NY2d 840, 842; People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600). A duplicitous indictment is not jurisdictionally defective (see, People v Caban, 129 AD2d 721, lv denied 70 NY2d 644). Thus, by pleading guilty defendant has waived any challenge to count one as being duplicitous (see, People v Aiello, 153 AD2d 988, 990-991, lv denied 74 NY2d 946; see also, People v Beattie, supra; People v Levin, 57 NY2d 1008, 1009).\nIn contrast to a failure to effectively charge a defendant with the commission of a particular crime, which is a jurisdictional defect (see, People v Iannone, supra, at 600; People v George, supra; People v Aiello, supra), a contention that an indictment is duplicitous is essentially a claim that a count of an indictment \u201ceffectively charges him with the commission of more than one crime\u201d (People v Caban, supra, at 721; see, CPL 200.30). Here, count one alleges every element of the crime charged\u2014including the requisite possession of at least two ounces of a narcotic drug\u2014and recites the precise Penal Law provision violated (see, Penal Law \u00a7 220.18 [1]; People v George, supra, at 713; People v Aiello, supra, at 990-991). As in People v Aiello (supra), \u201c[t]he allegations are consistent with such possession of either cocaine or heroin, or both [and,] [t]hus, the pleading defect * * * is more one of duplicity than the failure to state a crime\u201d (People v Aiello, supra, at 990). Defendant\u2019s contention that there existed an insufficient quantity of either drug alone is premised upon extrinsic evidence contained in the State Police report and does not constitute a jurisdictional defect in count one of the indictment (see, People v Aiello, supra; see also, People v Motley, 119 AD2d 57, 58-59, affd 69 NY2d 870). Accordingly, as defendant\u2019s contention on appeal does not raise a jurisdictional defect, he forfeited review of that issue by his guilty plea (see, People v Levin, 57 NY2d 1008, 1009, supra; People v Beattie, 80 NY2d 840, 842, supra; People v George, supra; People v Aiello, supra).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention is that the sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice from four years to life to the most lenient permissible sentence of three years to life, which minimum sentence the People had originally conditionally agreed to recommend in exchange for defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The record reflects that at the time defendant pleaded guilty the People agreed to recommend a sentence of four years to life, which bargain the People upheld at sentencing. Defendant had been reminded by County Court that the People would no longer recommend the most lenient sentence of three years to life once the suppression hearing began, and defendant did not agree to plead guilty until after the hearing was underway. At sentencing County Court, which had not previously committed to any sentence, imposed the agreed-upon sentence of four years to life. Accordingly, we perceive no basis in this record upon which to disturb the imposition of the agreed-upon, less than maximum sentence (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).\nPeters, J. P., Carpinello, Graffeo and Mugglin, JJ., concur.

The defendant argued that the indictment was duplicitous because it charged him with possessing both heroin and cocaine, but the court held that such a challenge was waived by his guilty plea since it did not constitute a jurisdictional defect. Additionally, the court found no grounds to reduce the agreed-upon sentence of four years to life, as the defendant had been aware of the terms before entering his plea.<|eot_id|>"}

Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment of at least one year and no more than SVa years to be followed by a two-year period of post-release supervision. County Court released defendant to interim probation pending sentencing. While on probation, defendant and a codefendant were charged in a 12-count indictment with additional drug-related crimes. In satisfaction thereof, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and again waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of this plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to nine years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to the sentence imposed in connection with the first indictment of 5x/2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was sentenced accordingly and he now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive.

In exchange, County Court agreed to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years. At the time of sentencing, the People requested that defendant be ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $100 to the City of Amsterdam Police Department pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9).\nWhile it is true, as defendant contends, that because the negotiated plea did not include mention of restitution, defendant was entitled to withdraw his plea or accept the greater sentence of restitution (see, People v Cowan, 168 AD2d 509), the record reflects that defendant elected to pursue the latter option. At the time the People requested restitution, defense counsel, in response to County Court\u2019s inquiry, acknowledged that restitution had not been addressed previously and asked for a moment to confer with his client. Thereafter, defense counsel advised the court that he had discussed the matter with defendant, who agreed to pay the restitution as requested and personally acknowledged to the court that such was the case.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to a 5V2-year prison term followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.\nFollowing entry of his plea and during the course of his presentencing interview, defendant made remarks to the probation officer denying that he had been aware of possessing the drugs underlying his conviction. Thereafter, at sentencing, Supreme Court specifically questioned defendant regarding these statements, asking repeatedly whether he wished to either make any statement to the court or withdraw his guilty plea, and he consistently answered \u201cno.\u201d As there is no indication in the record that defendant moved at any time thereafter to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim that the court erred in proceeding to sentence defendant in accord with his plea agreement is not preserved for our review (see People v Colon, 106 AD3d 1367, 1368 [2013]). Nor does the record reveal that the narrow exception to the preservation rule is applicable (see People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).\nSupreme Court took the necessary precautionary steps throughout the course of the proceedings to ensure that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. The court\nthoroughly explained the rights that defendant was forfeiting and the consequences of the plea, making a series of pertinent inquiries. The record thus fully demonstrates that defendant, who was represented by counsel, voluntarily entered the plea with knowledge and understanding (see People v Youngblood, 107 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1078 [2013]; People v Ramires, 264 AD2d 948, 949 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 906 [2000]).\nSupreme Court further advised defendant as to the effect of the waiver of appeal and inquired as to whether he had questions with respect to that separate issue for either his counsel or the court. Defendant thereafter waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence both orally on the record and by a written waiver executed before the court. We find this record adequate to demonstrate his voluntary and knowledgeable waiver (see People v Johnson, 106 AD3d 1331, 1332 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1016 [2013]; People v Foote, 102 AD3d 1056, 1057 [2013], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]; People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]). As Supreme Court advised, defendant\u2019s valid waiver of appeal forecloses the evidentiary challenges he now seeks to raise (see People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094 [2013]; People v Frierson, 21 AD3d 1211, 1212 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 753 [2005]).\nPeters, PJ., Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court convicting the defendant of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance based on his guilty plea.

Defendant was subsequently sentenced, as a predicate felon, in accordance with the plea agreement to a term of imprisonment of 6 to 12 years, with the sentence to run concurrent to a previously imposed sentence on another conviction. Defendant now appeals.\nAs an initial matter, we are not satisfied that defendant validly waived his right to appeal so we have reviewed the merits of defendant\u2019s contentions that his plea was involuntary, he received ineffective assistance of counsel and his sentence was harsh and excessive.\nAs defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he understood the ramifications of his guilty plea and freely admitted to facts which established the elements of the crime, his plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see People v Means, 35 AD3d 975, 976 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 948 [2007]). Defendant\u2019s argument that, on the basis of his claims of innocence contained in the presentence report, counsel\u2019s failure to either withdraw his guilty plea or raise the issue at sentencing rendered her representation less than meaningful, must also be rejected. Considering that defendant failed to raise this issue prior to sentencing and noting the advantageous plea agreement counsel negotiated, in which his sentence would run concurrent to a sentence for a previous conviction, we find that he received meaningful representation (see People v White, 47 AD3d 1062, 1064 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 818 [2008]; People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1005 [2007]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive is unavailing in light of the advantageous plea agreement which included a concurrent sentence.\nSpain, J.E, Kane, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur.

In connection with the replea, the agreement provided that the range of defendant\u2019s sentence would be a minimum possible sentence of three years to life and a maximum possible sentence of SVs years to life, to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision. No specific sentence was promised on either count. Defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.\nAs contemplated, defendant cooperated with the People, withdrew his plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and eventually replaced it with a plea of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. He was sentenced on the conspiracy conviction to a prison term of 4 to 12 years and on the criminal sale conviction\u2014upon application of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005\u2014to a prison term of seven years, with five years of postrelease supervision. The sentences were set to run concurrently.\nDefendant subsequently moved pursuant to CPL 440.20 to have his sentence set aside, arguing that he did not receive the full benefit of his plea bargain because the parties had assumed that his maximum prison exposure would stem from the criminal sale conviction, rather than the conspiracy conviction. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. Defendant\u2014raising only challenges to his sentence on the conspiracy conviction\u2014now appeals from his judgment of conviction and from the order denying his CPL 440.20 motion.\nInitially, although defendant waived his right to appeal, it is not clear that his waiver precludes a challenge to the sentence imposed on the conspiracy conviction. Although the written plea agreement executed by defendant clearly contemplates the waiver of his right to appeal from both convictions, defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal that references only the criminal sale conviction. During the subsequent plea colloquy, County Court adequately apprised defendant of the rights he was giving up by waiving his right to appeal, but did not separately address the crimes to which he pleaded and, thus, did not dispel the confusion created by the disparity in the written documents. Under these circumstances, we cannot discern whether defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished his right to appeal from the conspiracy conviction and, therefore, we will address the merits of his appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Middleton, 72 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2010]; People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]; cf. People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]).\nFirst, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that he did not receive the full benefit of his plea bargain. Specifically, defendant contends that because during the plea negotiations the parties assumed that defendant\u2019s maximum sentence would flow from the more serious criminal sale count, an implicit agreement arose that he would not be sentenced higher on the conspiracy count than on the criminal sale count. We find no evidence that a promise, express or implied, was made to defendant with regard to the sentence imposed upon his conspiracy conviction or that any understanding was reached that defendant would serve no more than the seven-year determinate sentence he ultimately obtained on the criminal sale conviction. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s request that we reduce his sentence for conspiracy in the second degree based on any failure by the People or County Court to abide by the plea agreement (see People v Cullen, 62 AD3d 1155, 1157 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009]; People v Long, 12 AD3d 788, 788-789 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 833 [2005]).\nDefendant also argues that the sentence County Court imposed upon his conviction of conspiracy in the second degree is harsh and excessive. The sentence of 4 to 12 years is below the maximum and less than that recommended by the People (i.e., 5 to 15 years). Furthermore, the plea agreement specifically apprised defendant of a potential maximum aggregate prison sentence of 8Vs years to life. Contrary to defendant\u2019s arguments, the fact that his cooperation coupled with the Drug Law Reform Act benefitted him to such an extent that his sentence on the criminal sale conviction may ultimately yield less prison time than the conspiracy conviction does not translate to a finding that his sentence on the conspiracy conviction is harsh, or even unjust. Indeed, we find nothing -in the rec ord revealing extraordinary circumstances warranting reduction of the sentence imposed, especially given defendant\u2019s role as the leader of a significant cocaine distribution operation (see People v Middleton, 72 AD3d at 1337; People v Cam Quan, 26 AD3d 644, 644 [2006]).\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that his counsel was ineffective for failing to gain a maximum sentence cap on the conspiracy conviction which was lower than that given on the criminal sale conviction. A defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel will be satisfied \u201c \u2018so long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u2019 \u201d (People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998], quoting People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). Here, a review of the record reflects that counsel\u2019s representation of defendant was meaningful. Indeed, defense counsel obtained an advantageous plea agreement for defendant, given the number and severity of the charges and defendant\u2019s potential exposure to an extremely long sentence (see People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1261 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]; People v Roberts, 38 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2007]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d 819, 819 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]).\nFinally, we find no error in County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s CPL 440.20 motion without a hearing. Where, as here, the record conclusively refutes the claim that a sentencing promise was made in the context of a plea agreement but not kept, there is no entitlement to a hearing (see People v Brown, 23 AD3d 702, 702-703 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d at 820).\nLahtinen, Stein, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment and order are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment and order denying the defendant's motion to set aside his sentence for conspiracy in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. The defendant pleaded guilty under a plea agreement that allowed him to cooperate with authorities, resulting in a lesser sentence for the drug sale conviction, but he argued he did not receive the full benefit of the bargain. The court found no evidence of a promise regarding the conspiracy sentence and determined that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive, rejecting claims of ineffective counsel and the need for a hearing on the motion.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant later requested that a scheduled sentencing date of March 6, 1997 be adjourned until March 31, 1997, with defen dant released on his own recognizance. County Court agreed to the adjournment but conditioned such release on defendant, inter alia, appearing for sentencing on the rescheduled date. The court warned defendant that a violation of any of these agreed-upon conditions would result in an increase of defendant\u2019s sentence up to the harshest available sentence of 8 Vs to 25 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant did not appear for sentencing and, when he was returned to court on a warrant over a year later, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 6 to 18 years. This appeal followed.\nWe affirm. Although defendant concedes that County Court was within its authority in imposing an enhanced sentence under the circumstances (see, e.g., People v Hughes, 260 AD2d 657; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880), he nevertheless maintains that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, a contention we cannot endorse. It is well settled that \u201ca sentence within permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification\u201d (People v Woodard, 263 AD2d 682). Given defendant\u2019s awareness of the consequences for violating the release conditions and his criminal history, we find no basis to reduce his sentence in the interest of justice.\nMercure, J.

Thereafter, in satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to a term of eight years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision. This appeal followed.\nWe affirm. Initially, in light of defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his claims that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are not preserved for our review (see People v Henry, 73 AD3d 1391, 1392 [2010]; People v Gomez, 72 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2010]; People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]). Further, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable herein as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that raised any doubt as to his guilt or tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Gantt, 84 AD3d 1642, 1643 [2011]). Although defendant did state that he had taken some prescription antidepressant medication prior to the plea, upon questioning by the court, defendant denied that this impaired his ability to understand the proceedings (see People v Amidon, 79 AD3d 1158, 1159 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 741 [2011]; People v Lafoe, 75 AD3d 663, 663-664 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 953 [2010]). Defendant\u2019s further claim that County Court failed to uphold an alleged promise to consider possible drug programs or alternative sentencing is not supported by the record (see People v Chaney, 70 AD3d 1251, 1252 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 748 [2010]).\nWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant\u2019s determinate sentence was the minimum available upon his conviction of the A-l felony of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.71 [2] [b] [i]; \u00a7 220.43), and thus this claim lacks merit (see People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]).\nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments, to the extent not specifically addressed above, have been examined and found to be unpersuasive.\nSpain, J.E, Rose, Kavanagh and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's conviction and sentence of eight years for selling cocaine, rejecting claims that the plea was not entered knowingly or that he received ineffective counsel, as these issues were not preserved for appeal.

Other arguments raised by the defendant were found to be unpersuasive.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant failed to either move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and has therefore failed to preserve his argument that the plea was coerced (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662; People v Guerrero, 176 AD2d 348, lv denied 79 NY2d 857; People v Calero-Atehortua, 172 AD2d 323, lv denied 78 NY2d 920). In any event, the fact that defendant feared that if he was convicted after trial of the crimes alleged in the six-count indictment he would have received a harsher sentence then he received on his plea to one count of the indictment does not constitute coercion (see, People v Mackey, 175 AD2d 346, 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 969). Finally, given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, he received less than the harshest possible sentence and that he pleaded guilty knowing what sentence would ultimately be imposed by County Court, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). We have considered defendant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.\nWeiss, P. J., Mikoll, Levine, Mercure and Mahoney, JJ., concur.

The court found that the defendant's fears regarding potential harsher penalties did not constitute coercion, and he received a lesser sentence by pleading guilty to one count of a six-count indictment.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant appeals contending that statements he made at sentencing cast doubt on the sufficiency of his plea allocution.\nInitially, we note that inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006; People v Smith, 184 AD2d 977).

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered April 9, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn satisfaction of a four-count indictment, and with no promise regarding sentence, defendant entered a plea of guilty to two counts of that indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years. On this appeal, defendant contends that the indictment was insufficient and the sentence harsh and excessive.\nInsofar as defendant\u2019s argument regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of the indictment raises a jurisdictional claim, the indictment\u2019s incorporation by reference to provisions of the Penal Law allegedly violated operates, without more, to sufficiently set forth all the elements of the crimes charged (see, People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850; People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586). Thus, the indictment provided fair notice of the charges to defendant (see, People v Ray, supra, at 850). We further note that any claim regarding the factual sufficiency of the jurisdictionally sufficient accusatory instrument was waived by defendant\u2019s guilty plea (see, People v Cohen, supra, at 587; People v George, 261 AD2d 711, 713, lv denied 93 NY2d 1018).\nWith regard to the sentence, which was well within the permissible statutory range, the record discloses neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor extraordinary circumstances warranting modification. Therefore, it will not be disturbed (see, People v Brown, 249 AD2d 835, 838; People v Tracey, 221 AD2d 738, lv denied 88 NY2d 943).\nMercure, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Defendant was subsequently sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement, as a second felony offender, to four years in prison with three years of postrelease supervision for the conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and 1 to 3 years in prison for the conviction of driving while intoxicated, with the terms to be served concurrently. In addition, County Court ordered defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $300. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The record reflects that County Court explained the nature of the right being waived \u201cwithout lumping that right into the panoply , of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; accord People v Jackson, 48 AD3d 885, 885 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 960 [2008]). Further, defendant expressed his understanding of the ramifications of the waiver and thereafter executed two written waivers in open court acknowledging the scope of the right waived and that he had been given sufficient time to discuss the waivers with counsel (see People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]; People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122, 1123 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 925 [2009]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant validly waived the right to appeal (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Winters, 73 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 811 [2010]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed by his wavier of the right to appeal (see People v Swindell, 72 AD3d 1340, 1341 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 778 [2010]; People v Vaughns, 70 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]). Although defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary survives his waiver of the right to appeal, the claim is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not triggered here inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of either crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt (see People v Thompson, 70 AD3d 1123 [2010]; People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251 [2009]).\nRegarding defendant\u2019s challenge to the restitution order, the record reveals that the terms of the plea agreement included the amount of restitution, and defendant did not request a hearing or otherwise contest the amount ordered. Accordingly, his contention that the sum awarded is not supported by the record is both barred by his waiver of the right to appeal and unpreserved for our review (see People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d at 1124). Finally, defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal precludes his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Board, 75 AD3d 833, 834 [2010]).\nSpain, Rose, Lahtinen and Garry, JJ., concur.

When defendant appeared for sentencing, County Court noted that the presen-tence report contained a statement attributed to defendant in which he asserted his innocence and claimed that he entered his plea in order to avoid a sentence of 25 years to life. The court adjourned the matter to permit defendant to consult with his attorney and, thereafter, defendant confirmed that the statements he made at the time of the plea, in which he admitted his guilt of the charged crime, were true and accurate. The court then imposed the agreed-upon indeterminate sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant contends that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, that the statutory scheme pursuant to which he was sentenced is unconstitutional and that his plea was not voluntary. Inasmuch as \u201ca defendant always retains the right to challenge the legality of the sentence or the voluntariness of the plea\u201d (People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal is irrelevant to this appeal (see, People v Falcis, 233 AD2d 340, Iv denied 89 NY2d 1011; People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, Iv denied 88 NY2d 982). With regard to defendant\u2019s challenge to the legality of his sentence, the facts and circumstances of this case do not warrant the conclusion that defendant\u2019s sentence violated the constitutional proscriptions of cruel and unusual punishment (see, People v Thompson, 83 NY2d 477). We note that defendant is a previously deported alien with a lengthy criminal history which includes drug-related crimes, and he admitted possessing two pounds of cocaine at the time of his arrest for the instant offense.\nThere is also no merit to defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea. During the plea proceeding, County Court advised defendant of his rights and the consequences of a guilty plea and conducted a thorough colloquy to determine that defendant, who was represented by counsel, was entering a knowing and voluntary plea and had, in fact, committed the crime charged in the indictment. Based upon defendant\u2019s claim of innocence during an interview for the presentence report, the court adjourned the sentencing to provide defendant with an opportunity to confer with counsel to determine whether he wanted to withdraw the plea. When defendant appeared on the adjourned date, defense counsel advised the court that he had been given sufficient opportunity to consult with his client and that defendant wanted to proceed with sentencing based upon the plea. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, defendant assured the court that the statement in the presentence report was not accurate and that the statements he made at the time of the plea were true and accurate.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s contention on appeal, that he was improperly sentenced as a predicate felony offender, survives his appeal waiver but was not preserved due to his failure to object at sentencing despite an opportunity to do so (see People v Woods, 147 AD3d 1156, 1157 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1089 [June 14, 2017]; People v Lowell, 126 AD3d 1235, 1235 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1167 [2015]). Defendant was advised during the plea allocution that he was, potentially, a persistent felony offender, and thereafter provided with a copy of the predicate felony offender information. At sentencing, defense counsel affirmed that defendant did not wish to controvert the allegations in the information and did not have any constitutional or other challenge to the conviction, and defendant then admitted the conviction. Given these circumstances, we are satisfied that there was substantial compliance with the applicable requirements and that corrective action in the interest of justice is not warranted (see CPL 400.21; People v Woods, 147 AD3d at 1157; People v Melton, 136 AD3d 1069, 1070 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]; People v Jones, 47 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 865 [2008]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Garry, Egan Jr., Clark and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nWhere the appellate claim is that the sentence is unauthorized and, therefore, illegal, as readily discernible from the face of the record, preservation is not required (see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52, 55-58 [2000]; People v Martinez, 130 AD3d 1087, 1088 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]).

Defendant later maintained that the drugs belonged to her and admitted that she was making and selling crack from her apartment. She testified at the trial of her paramour that he was not involved in her drug selling operation. Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. No sentencing promise was made as part of the plea, although County Court informed defendant that she could receive anywhere from three years to life in prison. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to five years to life in prison and she now appeals.\nWe affirm. Upon reviewing the record, we find that defendant has failed to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion that would warrant reducing the sentence in the interest of justice. Defendant possessed a significant quantity of drugs, operated a well-organized distribution network from her home and, in doing so, exposed her child to a potential danger. In view of this, we find no reason to disturb the sentence (see People v Rosa-Oyola, 301 AD2d 750 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 658 [2003]; People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]).\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Spain, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Originally convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree and bail jumping in the first degree, defendant obtained a reversal of those convictions upon appeal to this court (74 AD2d 700). The indictment charging criminal possession was dismissed while the bail jumping charge was remitted to the County Court for further proceedings. Defendant now appeals from his subsequent conviction for bail jumping and argues that the dismissal of the underlying criminal possession of a controlled substance charge nullifies the bail jumping charge. We disagree. The crime of bail jumping is committed when \u00e1 person who is released by court order upon bail or his own recognizance fails to make a scheduled court appearance within a specified period of time (see Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 215.56, 215.57). As such, it is a crime separate and distinct from the predicate charge which gave rise to the bail jumping offense. Defendant\u2019s ultimate success on the predicate charge does not in any way excuse or justify his failure to obey a court order directing his appearance in connection therewith (see People v Minefee, 14 111 App 3d 796). Defendant\u2019s other contentions have been examined and found to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P.

When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, a warrant was issued for his arrest and, after being apprehended, he was sentenced as a predicate felon to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Wfiiile defendant\u2019s direct appeal of this conviction was pending, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service served upon him a notice that, as a result of his conviction, deportation proceedings would be initiated against him. After defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal (25 AD3d 876 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 850 [2006]), he moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 because, as defendant claimed, he only pleaded guilty in reliance on his counsel\u2019s assurance that the resulting conviction would not mandate his deportation under federal law. Therefore, defendant claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and, as a result, his decision to enter a guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. County Court denied his application without a hearing. By permission of this Court, defendant now appeals.\nGiven defendant\u2019s insistence that he would not have pleaded guilty but for counsel\u2019s advice regarding the issue of deportation, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel impacts upon the voluntariness of his plea and survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]). The failure of counsel to correctly advise a defendant that a guilty plea may result in deportation under applicable federal law can provide a basis for vacating the guilty plea if it can be shown that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s misstatement; defendant would not have entered a guilty plea (see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 114-115 [2003]; People v Argueta, 46 AD3d 46, 50 [2007], lv dismissed 10 NY3d 761 [2008]; People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d 437, 440 [2004]). Here, defendant alleges that his counsel made an \u201cassurance that he would not have to worry about Immigration trying to deport him\u201d if he accepted the plea bargain and entered a guilty plea (compare People v Sepulveda, 65 AD3d 754, 755 [2009]; People v Nunez, 25 AD3d 376, 377 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 836 [2006]). In fact, federal law requires that all deportable aliens be removed from the United States and defines a deportable alien as one who has been convicted of \u201ca violation of. . . any law or regulation of a [s]tate, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in [21 USC \u00a7 802]), other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana\u201d (8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]; see People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d at 439). Given defendant\u2019s insistence that he would not have pleaded guilty but for his reliance on this alleged misstatement by counsel of applicable federal law, County Court should have held a hearing prior to deciding defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion (compare People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 115).\nSpain, J.E, Rose, Lahtinen and Malone Jr., JJ., concur.

Thereafter, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of marihuana in the first degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to all three counts of the indictment and, during the course of the plea allocution, he executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms, resulting in an aggregate sentence of three years.

Defendant pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to an aggregate prison term of 14 years, plus five years of post-release supervision.

Further, with regard to the plea, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated a material element of the crime or otherwise raised any doubt as to his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]).

He also executed a written waiver of the right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to an indeterminate term of 4 to 12 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant initially contends that his guilty plea was not voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently entered because the allocution was factually deficient. Inasmuch as defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, he has failed to preserve this claim for our review (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814, lv denied 98 NY2d 772; People v McWhite, 295 AD2d 757). We find the exception to the preservation rule inapplicable here inasmuch as the plea colloquy does not reveal that defendant\u2019s factual recitation casts significant doubt on his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635). In any event, were we to review defendant\u2019s claim, we would find it to be without merit. \u201c[D]efendant\u2019s affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s questions established the elements of the crime [ ] charged and there is no indication in the record that the voluntary plea was baseless or improvident\u201d (People v Kemp, supra at 636; see People v Bunger, 269 AD2d 620, lv denied 94 NY2d 945).\nMoreover, defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is not premised upon the alleged involuntariness of the plea, does not survive defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Porter, 300 AD2d 698; People v Almonte, 288 AD2d 632, lv denied 97 NY2d 726). Even if it did, defendant\u2019s failure to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes him from raising it (see People v Smith, 300 AD2d 745; People v King, 299 AD2d 661). Nevertheless, were we to review this claim, we would also find it unpersuasive. The record does not substantiate defendant\u2019s assertion that his counsel did not adequately investigate potential defenses. Viewing the totality of the circumstances, we find that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807).\nLastly, defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentence is also encompassed by his voluntary waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 702; People v Teague, supra at 815). Even if it was not, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lopez, supra).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea. The defendant's claims regarding the voluntariness of the plea and ineffective assistance of counsel were deemed unpreserved for review due to his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment. Additionally, his challenge to the severity of the sentence was also barred by his waiver of the right to appeal, and the sentence was found to be in accordance with the plea agreement without extraordinary circumstances warranting modification.<|eot_id|>"}

Prior to the submission of the case to the grand jury, the Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case overheard defendant admit to owning the drugs in question. Recognizing that he may be called as a witness, the Assistant District Attorney recused himself from acting as trial counsel. Defendant thereafter moved to disqualify the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office and sought appointment of a special prosecutor, which motion was denied. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 12 to 24 years. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant contends that Supreme Court (Lament, J.) erred in denying his motion to disqualify the District Attorney\u2019s office. We disagree. It is now well established that, absent a showing of an actual conflict of interest, the advocate-witness rule (see Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102 [a] [22 NYCRR 1200.21 (a)]) does not contemplate disqualification of an entire District Attorney\u2019s office merely because one of the assistants will be called to testify concerning a material fact issue (see e.g. People v Keeton, 74 NY2d 903; People v Paperno, 54 NY2d 294; People v Freeman, 172 AD2d 1045, lv denied 78 NY2d 1011). As no such showing was made here, disqualification was not warranted.\nDefendant also contends that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Again we disagree. While defendant points to inconsistencies regarding the People\u2019s evidence concerning the ownership of the drugs, we need note only that the jury heard testimony that defendant admitted, on more than one occasion, that the drugs in question belonged to him. Under the circumstances, any conflict in the evidence regarding defendant\u2019s dominion and control over the cocaine in question merely created issues of witness credibility, and the jury\u2019s determination in that regard must be accorded great deference (see People v Montcrieft, 296 AD2d 718, 719, lv denied 98 NY2d 770). Accordingly, we are satisfied that proper weight was accorded to the record evidence by the jury. We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them equally without merit.\nPeters, Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, rejecting his appeal regarding the denial of his motion to disqualify the Albany County District Attorney's office.

On February 8, 2005 the defendant entered a plea of guilty to four drug-related offenses, based on the understanding that he would be sentenced under the DLRA to four concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 3V2 years. The People declined to participate in the plea bargain, contending that, under the law in effect at the time the crimes were committed, the minimum legal sentence would be an indeterminate term of imprisonment of four and one-half to nine years. On March 22, 2005 the County Court sentenced the defendant in accordance with the promise made at the time of his plea of guilty.\nFor the reasons set forth in People v Goode (25 AD3d 723 [2006]), the sentence imposed upon the defendant was invalid as a matter of law, and the defendant must be resentenced under the law applicable at the time of the commission of the offenses (see People v Torres, 26 AD3d 398 [2006]; People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005], lv granted 6 NY3d 757 [2005]).

In' accord with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him as a nonviolent second felony offender to a prison term of three years, to be executed as a parole supervision sentence, thus allowing for his participation in a drug treatment program. Defendant appeals.\nThe sentence imposed was not authorized by law. At the time of the plea and sentencing, defendant\u2019s conviction for a class C felony did not qualify for a disposition of parole supervision (see Penal Law former \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i]; [d]; CPL former 410.91 [5]). We are required to vacate the sentence, notwithstanding the People\u2019s argument that the error favored defendant (see People v Cameron, 83 NY2d 838, 840 [1994]). \u201c[T]his [C]ourt cannot permit a sentence which is invalid as a matter of law to stand\u201d (People v Peale, 122 AD2d 353, 354 [1986]; see CPL 470.15 [2] [c]; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d 920, 921 [1984]). Further, as the error affected the sentence both as promised at the time of the plea and as later imposed, it rendered the plea involuntary, and defendant must be allowed the opportunity to withdraw his plea and stand trial (see People v Cameron, 83 NY2d at 840; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 239-240 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d at 921).

Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to six months in jail, with five years of probation.\nOn appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in failing to suppress the physical evidence (cocaine and marihuana) seized by the police because the seizure arose from an illegal detention following a traffic stop. Defendant filed an omnibus motion in December 2014, and a Huntley hearing was held on February 19, 2015 to determine the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements to the police. County Court issued a decision and order on February 23, 2015, which made no ruling with regard to the admissibility of the physical evidence. The People made a plea offer on March 25, 2015, and defendant entered a guilty plea on March 26, 2015 and was sentenced on May 28, 2015. We find that defendant forfeited his right to appellate review regarding the suppression issue because he entered his guilty plea before County Court rendered its decision on the motion to suppress the physical evidence (see People v Rodriguez, 118 AD3d 1182, 1182-1183 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 964 [2014]; People v Brabham, 112 AD3d 1066, 1067 [2013]; People v Morrison, 106 AD3d 1201, 1202 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1065 [2014]).\nPeters, P.J., Lynch, Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which had convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following his guilty plea.

Both the sentencing minutes and the uniform sentence and commitment form indicated that County Court recommended that petitioner be considered for the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program. County Court also, however, signed a separate order directing that petitioner be enrolled in the CASAT program. Subsequently, after petitioner began serving his sentence, his application for admission to the CASAT program was denied. Petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul that determination, which Supreme Court granted to the extent of ordering respondents to enroll petitioner in the first phase of the CASAT program. Respondents appeal and petitioner cross-appeals.\nPetitioner argued before Supreme Court that respondents were required to enroll him in the CASAT program in accordance with County Court\u2019s order specifically directing his enrollment in that program. We do not agree. Although a sentencing court is empowered to direct an individual\u2019s enrollment in the CASAT program if the individual \u201cstands convicted of a controlled substance or marihuana offense,\u201d such was not the case here (Penal Law \u00a7 60.04 [6]; see People v Brown, 58 AD3d 540, 540 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 814 [2009]). Under these circumstances, the separate order by County Court directing petitioner\u2019s enrollment in the CASAT program must be viewed as a nonbinding recommendation (see Correction Law \u00a7 71 [6]; People v Brown, 58 AD3d at 540; People v Parley, 297 AD2d 499, 501 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 503 [2002]; People v Sass, 182 AD2d 861, 862 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 837 [1992]).

The court warned defendant that, if he was arrested on new charges while on release pending sentencing, the court\u2019s sentencing promise of 1 to 3 years would no longer stand and defendant could be sentenced to 5 to 15 years. Defendant agreed and his plea of guilty was accepted. While on release pending sentencing, defendant was arrested on a new charge of robbery in the first degree. The court satisfied itself that there was a basis for the arrest (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702), and, after denying the request of defendant to withdraw his plea, sentenced defendant to 7 to 21 years.\nBefore imposing a harsher sentence than that agreed upon, the court must offer defendant an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. Although the court could impose an enhanced sentence upon defendant\u2019s arrest on new charges prior to sentencing, it could not impose an enhanced sentence higher than 5 to 15 years without providing defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Thus, we modify the judgment on appeal by vacating the sentence, and we remit the matter to Onondaga County Court to impose the sentence promised or to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea (see, People v Thomas, 210 AD2d 902; People v Scerbo, 197 AD2d 885, 886; People v Williams, 195 AD2d 1040, 1041).

The defendant had pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance and was promised a 1 to 3-year sentence, which would increase to 5 to 15 years if arrested on new charges. After being arrested for robbery while awaiting sentencing, the court sentenced him to 7 to 21 years, which was deemed improper without offering him a chance to withdraw his plea; thus, the sentence was vacated.<|eot_id|>"}

In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.\nAs an initial matter, we agree with defendant that his appeal waiver was invalid inasmuch as the record reveals that defendant was not advised that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1208 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d 1250, 1251 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). Defendant is therefore not precluded from challenging the severity of the imposed sentence (see People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]; People v Maxwell, 142 AD3d 739, 740 [2016]). We nevertheless find this challenge to be without merit. In view of defendant\u2019s multiple prior drug-related convictions, we discern no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Slamp, 145 AD3d 1320, 1321 [2016]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d at 1251).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Devine and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea. Although the appeal waiver was deemed invalid due to the defendant not being properly informed about its distinct nature, the court found the challenge to the sentence's severity meritless, given the defendant's prior drug-related convictions. Thus, the original sentence of four years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision was upheld.<|eot_id|>"}

He pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to receive a prison sentence of 6V2 to 13 years to run concurrently with any other sentence he was then serving. Thereafter, he was sentenced as a predicate felon in accordance with the plea agreement.\nDefendant\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. However, inasmuch as the record discloses that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal, we decline to address his claim (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

Thereafter, he agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and assault in the first degree in full satisfaction of all charges. As part of the plea agreement, he was to receive a sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison on the criminal possession charge and a determinate 10-year prison term on the assault charge, to run consecutively. At the time of his plea, defendant executed a written waiver of the right to appeal. During the plea proceedings, County Court advised defendant that he would have to acknowledge his waiver at sentencing. Prior to sentencing, however, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and disavowed his waiver of the right to appeal. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. At sentencing, defendant refused to reaffirm his waiver of the right to appeal. As a result, County Court did not abide by the original sentencing promise with respect to the assault charge and imposed a determinate 15-year prison term instead. Defendant now appeals.\nInitially, we find no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing. \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[t]he decision to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea is a matter within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to its voluntariness\u2019 \u201d (People v Bagley, 298 AD2d 616, 616 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 580 [2003], quoting People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664 [2002]; see People v Babcock, 304 AD2d 912 [2003]). As grounds supporting his motion, defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective and that he is innocent of the charges. Our review of the record, however, does not reveal that defendant protested his innocence during any stage of the proceedings. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that his attorney did not competently represent him or that he was coerced into entering the plea. Rather, after being fully informed of the consequences of pleading guilty and the rights he was waiving thereby, defendant related that he had conferred with counsel and understood them. He proceeded to admit the elements of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. Insofar as defendant has advanced nothing but conclusory assertions, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion without a hearing (see People v Kagonyera, 304 AD2d 984, 985 [2003]; People v Robinson, 301 AD2d 745, 746 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]).\nWe reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to County Court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence on the assault charge based upon defendant\u2019s failure to reaffirm his waiver of the right to appeal at sentencing. Although County Court informed defendant during the plea proceedings that his acknowledgment and waiver of the right to appeal was part of the plea bargain, it did not specifically instruct him that reaffirming such waiver was a condition of the plea bargain itself and that his failure to do so would result in a greater sentence. Consequently, we conclude that defendant could not be subjected to an enhanced sentence under these circumstances (see People v Pham, 287 AD2d 789, 790 [2001]; cf. People v Paige, 266 AD2d 587, 588 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 827 [1999]; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, 854 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 880 [1999]). Inasmuch as the People concede this and consent to the imposition of the sentence negotiated as part of the plea agreement, we find that this is the appropriate remedy (see People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63, 69 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 967 [2000]).\nCardona, P.J., Crew III, Peters and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; defendant is sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment of 10 years on his conviction of assault in the first degree; and, as so modified, affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court modified the defendant's sentence after he failed to reaffirm his waiver of the right to appeal at sentencing. While the court upheld the denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, it determined that he could not receive an enhanced sentence for not affirming the waiver, as he had not been clearly informed that doing so was a condition of the plea bargain. Consequently, the court imposed the originally negotiated sentence of 10 years for the assault conviction, to run consecutively with the other sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of 3V2 to 7 years in prison and one year in jail, respectively. Before defendant was sentenced, the laws regarding sentencing for drug felonies were changed and, as a result, the prosecution agreed to the imposition of a lesser sentence. Consequently, on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, County Court sentenced defendant to 3V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. On the charge of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree, County Court sentenced defendant to a conditional discharge. Defendant appeals.\nAppellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Inasmuch as defendant could have received an even shorter prison sentence under the recent drug law amendments (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [iii]), we are of the view that there is at least one issue of arguable merit pertaining to the severity of the sentence (see People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 553-554 [2006]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]). Thus, without passing judgment on the ultimate merit of this issue, appellate counsel is relieved and new counsel will be appointed to address this issue and any others that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]; People v Cruwys, supra).\nCardona, EJ., Peters, Spain, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

We reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was entrapped into committing the crime to which he pleaded guilty, the most serious count of the indictment, to enable the People to gain leverage in plea negotiations. By pleading guilty, defendant waived all factual defenses, including the defense of entrapment (see, People v Normandin, 122 AD2d 348). Further, we find no denial of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws in the District Attorney\u2019s policy not to accept pleas to less than the top count of an indictment. The offer of a plea bargain is not a constitutional right, but a matter of prosecutorial discretion (see, Weatherford v Bursey, 429 US 545, 561). Because neither a fundamental right nor a suspect classification is involved here, we need find only a rational basis for different plea-bargaining policies in different counties (see, People v Elliby, 80 AD2d 875). Such a basis is apparent in the differing caseloads and staffing which exist in different areas of the State. Finally, given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a single count in full satisfaction of a nine-count indictment and the sentence was in accord with the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).\nWeiss, P.

The plea agreement, which also satisfied another pending charge, provided that defendant would receive a prison term of three years with two years of postrelease supervision subject to certain conditions, including that he \u201ccomply with the jail rules.\u201d County Court specifically warned defendant that breaking the jail rules could result in an enhanced sentence of four years in prison. When defendant appeared for sentencing, the court advised the parties that it had received documents from the jail regarding defendant\u2019s violation of jail rules, including possession of contraband and testing positive for opiates, which defendant did not dispute. The court determined that defendant had violated the conditions of his plea agreement and that it was no longer bound to the promised sentence, and imposed a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision, as an admitted second drug felony offender. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid combined oral and written appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Hall, 147 AD3d 1151, 1151-1152 [2017]). Defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea agreement, and County Court provided a detailed explanation of the rights that were not waived, ascertained that defendant understood the waiver and conveyed that it was separate and distinct from the trial-related rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea. Defendant then executed a written waiver of appeal, indicating that he had read and understood it and had no questions (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1262 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). As defendant\u2019s \u201cfull appreciation of the consequences and understanding of the terms and conditions of the plea, including a waiver of the right to appeal, are apparent on the face of the record\u201d (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), we find that his waiver of appeal was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently and voluntarily\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Further, the court informed defendant of the specific conditions that he had to abide by or risk enhancement of his sentence, and defendant and counsel were afforded an opportunity to contest the violations and did not dispute that defendant had received adequate warnings and had violated the conditions. Accordingly, an enhanced sentence was authorized and did not constitute an abuse of discretion (see People v Albergotti, 17 NY3d 748, 750 [2011]; People v Lester, 141 AD3d 951, 953-954 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1185 [2017]). Given that the court advised him of the consequences of violating the conditions of his plea, defendant\u2019s challenge to the enhanced sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Gilbert, 145 AD3d 1196, 1197 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1184 [2017]; People v Lester, 141 AD3d at 954).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Garry, Lynch, Rose and Mulvey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine after pleading guilty and waiving his right to appeal. The County Court imposed a four-year sentence, exceeding the initial three-year agreement due to the defendant's violations of jail rules. The appeal was affirmed, as the court found the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily, and the enhanced sentence was justified based on the defendant's violations.<|eot_id|>"}

He now appeals challenging the sufficiency of his plea allocution and, alternatively, asserting that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea under CPL 220.60 (3) or to vacate the judgment of conviction under CPL 440.10 (see, People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine (see, People v Lopez, supra, at 666) is not applicable here inasmuch as the record fails to disclose any circumstances that would have warranted further inquiry by County Court prior to accepting defendant\u2019s plea (see, People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006; People v Vonderchek, 245 AD2d 979, 980, lv denied 91 NY2d 945). In any event, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was entered into voluntarily and that his allocution established all of the necessary elements of the crimes to which he pleaded.\nLikewise, we conclude that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive. Where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting modification (see, People v Brown, 239 AD2d 784, 785, lv denied 91 NY2d 870; People v Parson, 209 AD2d 882, 884, lv denied 84 NY2d 1014). In light of defendant\u2019s prior criminal history and the serious nature of the crimes, we find no reason to modify the sentence imposed (see, People v Brown, supra, at 785; People v Vasquez, 231 AD2d 755, lv denied 89 NY2d 931).\nMercure, J.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2xh to 5 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, County Court received a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 indicating that defendant had been previously convicted of a felony on February 20, 1997. Based upon this statement, the court sentenced him as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender because County Court did not comply with the requirements of CPL 400.21. Preliminarily, we note that inasmuch as this claim implicates the legality of the sentence, defendant is not precluded from raising it by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Turner, 26 AD3d 524, 525 [2006]; People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Turning to the merits, defendant argues that County Court did not inquire if he wished to controvert the allegations contained in the second felony offender statement as required by CPL 400.21 (3). He makes no argument, however, challenging the validity of the prior conviction. A review of the sentencing transcript discloses that County Court read the statement and then asked defense counsel if his client acknowledged the prior conviction. Defendant responded that he did. Given defendant\u2019s admission that he was the person convicted of the prior felony and the fact that he was given sufficient notice of and an opportunity to controvert the allegations made in the second felony offender statement, we find that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 and that County Court\u2019s failure to specifically ask defendant if he wished to controvert the allegations of the statement was a harmless oversight (see People v Booker, 280 AD2d 785, 786 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 916 [2001]; People v Mann, 258 AD2d 738, 739 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 900 [1999]).\nCardona, PJ., Spain, Mugglin, Rose and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Thereafter, following unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a plea bargain, defendant was indicted on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Thereafter, defendant substituted attorneys and, on the eve of trial, pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second .degree and waived his right to appeal. No specific promise was made as to defendant\u2019s sentence other than County Court\u2019s commitment to sentence him to no less than three years to life and no more than five years to life.

He cannot challenge his claimed defects in the Grand Jury proceedings and assertions of prosecutorial vindictiveness and selective prosecution (see, People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227; People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97; People v Lynch, 256 AD2d 651, lv denied 93 NY2d 1004). Furthermore, since defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the Grand Jury process does not include an allegation that \u201cthe alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea\u201d (People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982; see, People v Lynch, supra), his waiver precludes judicial review of that issue.\nAlthough it is true that the presence of alleged jurisdictional or constitutional defects in the Grand Jury proceeding that implicate the integrity of the process may survive a guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see, People v Hansen, supra), our review of defendant\u2019s claims herein reveals contentions that could, at worst, be characterized as flaws of a technical or evidentiary nature that can be forfeited by a guilty plea (see, id.). Specifically, defendant maintains that the prosecution failed to advise the Grand Jury of his request, pursuant to CPL 190.50 (6), to have it hear the testimony of Ewart, the person listed as the addressee on the package received by defendant. As a result, defendant claims that this failure impaired the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding and rendered the indictment subject to dismissal pursuant to CPL 210.35 (5) (see, People v Butterfield, 267 AD2d 870, lv denied 95 NY2d 833). Regardless of the merit of this claim, however, in our view a claimed violation of this statutory right does not \u201cactivate a question of jurisdiction\u201d or constitute a constitutional defect and, thus, does not survive a guilty plea (People v Hansen, supra, at 231). Accordingly, we cannot adopt defendant\u2019s view that the indictment must be dismissed on this ground.\nThe remaining issues raised by defendant have been examined and, to the extent that they have been preserved for appellate review, been found to be without merit.\nMercure, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nDefendant\u2019s request that the prosecution advise the Grand Jury foreperson of defendant\u2019s request to have Federal Express employees, the handler of the dog that sniffed the package and every person who handled the package, including law enforcement personnel, testify was agreed to by the District Attorney prior to the Grand Jury proceedings and our review of the Grand Jury minutes appears to establish that the individuals who handled the package did, in fact, testify.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of St. Lawrence County convicted the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree after he pleaded guilty, waiving his right to appeal.

After extensive plea negotiations, including consideration of his possible deportation for committing a felony narcotics offense (see 8 USC \u00a7 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]) and a negative evaluation for admission to the Drug Court, defendant pleaded guilty on January 11, 2006 to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to four months in jail followed by five years of probation.\nAfter receipt of the presentence report, County Court, with the consent of the District Attorney, agreed to place defendant on interim probation for a period of one year, after which-assuming he complied with the terms of probation-defendant\u2019s guilty plea to the felony would be vacated and he would be permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, thereby avoiding the possibility of deportation. However, other charges were filed against defendant within the probationary term and, subsequently, defendant changed attorneys and moved to withdraw his plea. Finally, on January 3, 2008, after 22 scheduled court appearances, County Court sentenced defendant to five years of probation. Defendant now appeals, asserting that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted.\nWe disagree and affirm. \u201cGenerally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement\u201d (People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940 [1998] [citation omitted]) and \u201cthe decision to permit withdrawal ... is a matter committed to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion\u201d (People v Singletary, 51 AD3d 1334, 1334 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 741 [2008]). Here, a careful review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (see generally People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 17 [2002], affd 1 NY3d 109 [2003]).\nPeters, J.P., Rose, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to five years in prison to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision and was to waive his right to appeal. During the plea proceedings, County Court agreed to release defendant on a one-week furlough so that he could spend time with his children before sentencing, but admonished him that a condition of his release was that he not consume alcohol or drugs. When he reappeared for sentencing, it was disclosed that defendant had tested positive for THC. As a result, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of six years in prison to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant argues that County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence without first conducting a hearing to determine if he, in fact, violated the conditions of his release by smoking marihuana while he was on furlough. We note that this issue has not been preserved due to defendant\u2019s failure to object to the enhanced sentence on this basis or to move to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Wachtel, 117 AD3d 1203 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1044 [2014]; People v Bucknor, 116 AD3d 1233, 1234 [2014]). In any event, County Court afforded defendant an opportunity to respond and, given the positive test results and defendant\u2019s admission to smoking marihuana, assured itself that the enhanced sentence was based upon reliable and accurate information (see People v Kocher, 116 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2014]; People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013], lv denied 23 3MY3d 1023 [2014]; People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]).

Following plea negotiations, the People agreed to allow defendant to plead guilty to a class D felony with an agreed-upon sentence of 3 to 9 years, conditioned on defendant\u2019s cooperation with undercover investigations. County Court advised defendant that it would not abide by the agreed-upon sentence if defendant failed to appear at sentencing. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, the court issued a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. When he appeared before the court following that arrest, defendant advised the court that, on the date of sentencing, he had been incarcerated in Onondaga County Jail and had asked correction officers to contact Cayuga County Court to explain why he was unable to appear for sentencing. Although they allegedly told defendant that they would, they did not do so. Defendant further stated that he had attempted to contact defense counsel, but that counsel had left his employment and the current defense counsel was assigned without defendant\u2019s knowledge. Current defense counsel confirmed that fact. The court imposed a sentence of 8V3 to 25 years.\nUnder the circumstances, and in the exercise of our discretion, we vacate the sentence and impose the originally bargained for sentence of 3 to 9 years.\nWe have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit.

Defendant appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, particularly given his mental health issues. We disagree. Noting defendant\u2019s criminal history and the favorable plea resolution, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the bargained-for sentence (see People v Nixon, 98 AD3d 1169, 1169 [2012]; People v Ross, 45 AD3d 897, 897 [2007]).\nPeters, P.J., Rose, Lynch and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court of Chemung County, which convicted him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree after he pleaded guilty.

The plea satisfied a four-count indictment charging defendant with the sale of cocaine on two occasions in 2010. He was sentenced, as agreed, to a prison term of 4V2 years with two years of post-release supervision, and now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that his allocution was not factually sufficient were not preserved for review in this Court by a postallocution motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2010]; see also People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 363-364 [2013]). Defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea or his guilt so as to implicate the exception to the preservation requirement (see id,.). In fact, when asked by County Court at sentencing, defendant specifically declined an opportunity to withdraw his plea. In any event, the record establishes the knowing, voluntary and intelligent nature of his plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365; People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]).\nNext, defendant argues that County Court\u2019s failure to read or consider his 17-page pro se submission put forth at sentencing requires that his plea be vacated. Given that defendant was represented by counsel and was not entitled to hybrid rep resentation, we do not find that the court abused its discretion by not entertaining his pro se submission before imposing sentence (see People v Rodriguez, 95 NY2d 497, 500-502 [2000]; People v Alsaifullah, 96 AD3d 1103, 1103 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 994 [2012]), particularly where he did not request an adjournment of sentencing or the removal of counsel. We find that the court properly proceeded to sentence defendant, having ascertained that he did not wish to withdraw his guilty plea. Defendant\u2019s contention that the bargained-for sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice is foreclosed by his valid and unchallenged waiver of appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; compare People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). Defendant\u2019s remaining claims similarly lack merit.\nMcCarthy, J.P., Rose and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.

County Court subsequently issued a letter decision dated April 21, 2011 denying the requested relief, which the court noted was \u201cnot clear.\u201d No appeal was taken therefrom, and that matter is not before this Court.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the judgment of the County Court, which had convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance following his guilty plea.

The defendant contends on this appeal that the identification made of him by the State trooper as the person who made the sales of heroin to him should be suppressed for the reason that the trooper was supplied with a photograph of the defendant by the Albany Police Department, and secondly that, in any event, since it was not established that the substance sold-was heroin, the trial court should not have accepted defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. We find no merit in either contention. The trial court concluded that the State trooper could make an in-court identification of the defendant based upon his observations of the accused, not only when the sales were made, but also on two prior occasions. This finding is supported by the evidence which clearly demonstrates an independent and untainted basis for the in-court identification aside from the photograph of the defendant (People v La Brake, 51 AD2d 609; People v Miller, 43 AD2d 605). As to the defendant\u2019s second argument, the record discloses that in response to the court\u2019s questions as to whether he had sold heroin to the State trooper on the dates in question, the defendant answered that he did.

The record reveals that, on November 30, 1990, defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced as a youthful offender to six months in the County Jail with five years\u2019 probation as long as he did not engage in any criminal conduct between the time of the plea and the date of sentencing. Defendant was also warned that he could then be sentenced up to 8\u2153 to 25 years in prison. During this time period, however, defendant was charged in two separate indictments for additional drug offenses and assault in the second degree. In addition, at least two felony complaints were outstanding against defendant charging him with at least two additional felonies. After new plea negotiations, defendant entered a second plea of guilty on March 14, 1991 to assault in the second degree in satisfaction of the remaining indictment, the felony complaints and new allegations regarding incidents that occurred the previous day at the jail. After taking into consideration all of these factors as well as the nature of the crimes involved, County Court sentenced defendant as promised to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years for the criminal possession conviction and 2Vs to 7 years for the assault conviction. Under these circumstances, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Henao, 149 AD2d 531, 532; People v Aia, 105 AD2d 592, 593; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).\nWeiss, P.

After he failed to appear for trial, a separate indictment was handed up charging him with bail jumping in the first degree.

A later indictment on December 19, 1984 charged defendant with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession in the third degree. The indictments having been consolidated for trial, the People moved, on September 18, 1985, to sever counts Nos. 1 and 2 of the first indictment and to limit the trial on that indictment to the latter two counts, together with both counts of the second indictment. The motion was granted and, after trial, defendant was convicted of all four counts. They all stemmed from sales of cocaine to an undercover police officer. On November 21, 1985 defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 5 to 15 years on his conviction of the two counts charged in the second indictment and 2\u2153 to 7 years on his conviction of both counts of the first indictment, all sentences to run concurrently.\nOn this appeal, defendant challenges only the sentence of 5 to 15 years as harsh and excessive.

Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon concurrent sentences of SVs years to life on each count. Defendant later moved to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 claiming that the evidence against him had been illegally obtained, he was under duress at the time of the plea and he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. In a written decision, County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals from both the judgment of conviction and, by permission, the order denying his motion.\nWe affirm. Initially, although County Court granted defendant\u2019s omnibus request for Huntley and Mapp hearings prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty while those suppression motions were pending and before a hearing was held or a decision rendered. He has, as a result, forfeited all claims related to those pending motions, including the claim that his statement to police was illegally obtained (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d 746, 747 [2004]; see also People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688 [1986]). Likewise, defendant\u2019s guilty plea waived his contention that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient, claims rejected by a decision of County Court on defendant\u2019s motion (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 233 [2000]; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 88-89 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 642 [2002]).\nNext, we reject defendant\u2019s contentions that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel or that his guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance in that counsel failed to pursue suppression motions (see People v Williams [June], 299 AD2d 580, 580 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 616, 621 [2003]). Given the uncertainty of success on the pretrial motions and the very favorable plea agreement\u2014which disposed of numerous A-level felonies, entailed less than maximum sentences for the A-II felonies, and avoided possible consecutive sentences\u2014defendant failed to demonstrate either the absence of a legitimate or strategic reason in advising him to forego a decision on the pending suppression motions and accept the then-available plea deal, or that counsel\u2019s representation was less than meaningful (see People v Whitehurst, supra at 89; see also People v Garcia, 75 NY2d 973, 974 [1990]; People v Chevalier, 226 AD2d 925, 929 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 934 [1996]). Moreover, during the plea colloquy, County Court specifically elicited from defendant that he had discussed the plea with counsel and was satisfied with his services (see People v Whitehurst, supra at 89; People v Chevalier, supra at 929). A review of the colloquy also reflects that the court advised defendant of the terms of the plea agreement and apprised him of the consequences of pleading guilty and the rights he was foregoing\u2014eliciting that he understood and allowing him to confer with counsel\u2014and demonstrates that he agreed to the plea terms in full; thereafter, defendant admitted the conduct and entered a guilty plea which was, in all respects, knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d at 747).\nWe further find unpersuasive defendant\u2019s contention that the agreed-upon concurrent prison sentences of SVs years to life are harsh and excessive and should be reduced to the minimum sentence of six years. As a second felony offender, defendant could have received consecutive sentences of I2V2 years to life on each of these distinct A-II felonies (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [a]; [4] [a]; \u00a7 70.25 [2]). There being no extraordinary circumstances in the record, we find no basis upon which to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in imposing the agreed-upon sentence (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; see also People v Mason, 2 AD3d 1207, 1207-1208 [2003]).\nIn view of the foregoing, and upon review of defendant\u2019s submissions, we find that County Court properly denied defendant\u2019s CPL article 440 motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [2], [3]; 440.30 [2]).\nMercure, J.P., Crew III, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 121/2 to 25 years on the possession of a controlled substance conviction and 31/2 to 7 years on the weapons conviction. Upon appeal, this Court determined that defendant was improperly sentenced as a predicate felon and remitted the matter for resentencing (176 AD2d 1007, lv denied 79 NY2d 824). Thereafter, defendant made a CPL 330.30 motion seeking to set aside the verdict on speedy trial grounds, an issue previously determined adversely to defendant both by County Court following a pretrial hearing and by this Court on defendant\u2019s original appeal (ibid.). County Court denied this motion and resentenced defendant to consecutive prison terms of 81/s to 25 years on the possession of a controlled substance conviction and 21/3 to 7 years on the weapons conviction. This appeal by defendant ensued.\nInitially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Contrary to defendant\u2019s claims, the record does not support his assertion that County Court imposed this particular sentence out of vindictiveness because his original sentence was reversed on appeal. Although it is true that the new sentence has a greater cumulative maximum term, it is also true that the minimum aggregate sentence is less than the original sentence. In any event, even if the new sentence is technically a more severe one, this is not a situation where a harsher sentence was imposed after a new trial (see, e.g., People v Van Pelt, 76 NY2d 156) and County Court adequately explained its reasons for the sentence imposed.\nTurning to defendant\u2019s renewed claim that he was denied his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial, we note that we previously considered and rejected this contention (see, 176 AD2d 1007, supra). Although defendant maintains that County Court erred in denying his CPL 330.30 motion without a hearing, County Court held that defendant\u2019s motion was both meritless and untimely because it was not made prior to defendant\u2019s original sentence. We do not need to determine the timeliness issue because we agree that defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied on the merits. In our view, the evidence defendant sought to introduce at a new hearing could have been produced at the earlier hearing in the exercise of \"due diligence\u201d (CPL 330.30 [3]; see, People v Wilson, 168 AD2d 696, 699) and was not of the character that would clearly indicate that reversal was required (CPL 330.30 [1]).\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, White and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the resentencing of the defendant, who had been convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance and weapon possession, after his original sentence was deemed improper. The court rejected the defendant's claims of excessive sentencing and denial of a speedy trial, noting that the new sentence, while having a greater maximum term, had a lower minimum term than the original. The court also found that the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict was properly denied as both meritless and untimely.<|eot_id|>"}

In October 2002, pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. The terms of the plea bargain included, inter alia, an agreement that a count of attempted grand larceny in the second degree then-pending in Albany County would be reduced to a misdemeanor at the time that he appeared on that count. In December 2002, defendant was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in accordance with the plea bargain. Defendant filed a notice of appeal from that judgment of conviction. Thereafter, in November 2003, the pending attempted grand larceny count was dismissed in Albany County, apparently on speedy trial grounds. Subsequently, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the prison sentence of 4 to 12 years and be resentenced to a term of 3 to 9 years. County Court denied that motion and defendant appeals from that order.\nInitially, we find that County Court properly denied defendant\u2019s CPL 440.20 motion. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, he has not established that his sentence was \u201cunauthorized, illegally imposed or otherwise invalid as a matter of law\u201d (CPL 440.20 [1]). Specifically, defendant asserts that his original attorney did not notify him of an offer of 3 to 9 years, which he would have accepted. However, the record establishes that, throughout the negotiations, the only definite offer made by the People was a sentence of 4 to 12 years. While there is proof that the prosecutor indicated that he would consider a counteroffer by defendant of 3 to 9 years under certain circumstances, it is undisputed that such a counteroffer was neither made by defendant nor accepted by the People. In the absence of a valid agreement, \u201cthe People had no obligation to abide by the terms suggested during the negotiation process\u201d (People v Wright, 233 AD2d 618, 618 [1996]). Thus, we are not confronted with a situation where County Court did not sentence defendant in accordance with an actual agreement (see e.g. People v Powers, 134 AD2d 736, 736 [1987]).\nWe are also unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence should be set aside because the plea bargain contemplated the reduction of the attempted grand larceny charge in Albany County which, instead, was ultimately dismissed. Significantly, County Court specifically noted on the record that the plea and sentence agreement would stand regardless of whether defendant eventually pleaded to a misdemeanor on the Albany County charge or chose to plead not guilty and go to trial. Since taking the matter to trial clearly contemplates acquittal as a possible disposition of the charge, the dismissal of the Albany County charge is not relevant to the subject matter.\nAdditionally, we find unavailing defendant\u2019s claim that County Court erred in denying his CPL 440.20 motion without a hearing. The transcripts do not substantiate defendant\u2019s contentions and the only basis for his allegations is contained in his own affidavit (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]). Defendant\u2019s original attorney denies failing to inform defendant of the plea negotiations. However, even if the proof at a hearing would have established that defendant was not apprised that the prosecutor would consider a counteroffer, such a circumstance would not render the sentence illegal or invalid as contemplated by CPL 440.20. Since the record sufficiently establishes that defendant\u2019s claim of a mistake in sentencing had no reasonable possibility of being true, it was not an abuse of discretion for County Court to determine the matter without a hearing (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]).\nFinally, we have reviewed defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice and find it to be unpersuasive.\nPeters, Spain, Carpinello and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment and order are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Saratoga County convicted the defendant of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and sentenced him to 4 to 12 years in prison, which he appealed.

The appellate court affirmed both the judgment of conviction and the order denying the motion, finding no merit in the defendant's arguments.<|eot_id|>"}

Prior to trial, defendant on several occasions attempted to plead guilty to the crime for which she was indicted, but County Court refused to permit her to do so; the last occasion occurred just before jury selection commenced. In again declining to accept her guilty plea, the court observed that in its judgment her endeavor to plead on that juncture simply constituted trial strategy on her part. Forced to trial, defendant, contrary to her counsel\u2019s advice, testified in her own behalf; her testimony not only established her guilt, but was a factor taken into consideration by County Court in sentencing defendant to 1 to 4 years in prison, the maximum sentence authorized.\nDefendant contends that County Court\u2019s refusal to allow her to plead guilty violated her statutory right to do so and that, because her trial testimony apparently so offended the court that it took it into account in inflicting a harsh sentence, that error was prejudicial and requires a reversal.\nCPL 220.10 (2) specifies that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in subdivision five [which is concededly inapplicable to the case at bar], the defendant may as a matter of right eilter a plea of \u2018guilty\u2019 to the entire indictment\u201d (emphasis supplied). Where the defendant denies guilt, or entry of the plea is not otherwise justified as knowingly and intelligently made, judicial rejection of a defendant\u2019s proposed guilty plea is appropriate (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 235, cert denied 419 US 1122). This case is not an instance of a court seeking to protect a defendant from an injudicious plea, but rather the judicial denial of a defendant\u2019s statutory right to plead guilty; accordingly, we reverse. Apart from County Court\u2019s statement that it was acting in the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d and its unexplained observation, neither documented in the record nor adequately explicated in the briefs, that defendant\u2019s offer merely represented trial strategy, there is nothing to indicate why accepting her plea was inappropriate. While the record suggests that the court and counsel held conferences regarding defendant\u2019s desire to plead to the indictment, what the circumstances were which led the court to exercise its discretion to refuse her plea, both earlier in the proceedings as well as on the eve of the trial, do not appear.\nDefendant\u2019s other contentions do not merit comment, except to note that defense counsel\u2019s mistrial application based on County Court\u2019s failure to grant a recess was properly denied, as the purpose of the recess was not to enable counsel to discuss whether defendant should testify (cf. People v Spears, 64 NY2d 698), but to record that she was testifying over his objection.\nJudgment reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. Kane, J. P., Main, Weiss, Yesawich, Jr., and Levine, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court reversed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal sale of marihuana, ruling that the County Court improperly denied her statutory right to plead guilty before trial. The court found no justified reason for the denial, as the defendant's attempts to plead guilty were not merely a trial strategy, and her subsequent testimony, which established her guilt, contributed to a harsh sentence of 1 to 4 years in prison. The case is remitted for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<|eot_id|>"}

As a result of that sale, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, on the condition that she could submit a motion to the sentencing court asking that the statutory mandatory prison sentence (Penal Law \u00a7 70.00) not be applied in her case. County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion and sentenced defendant to the minimum mandatory sentence of 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal ensued.\nDefendant\u2019s first contention is that her situation is one of the \"rare cases\u201d envisioned in People v Broadie (37 NY2d 100, 119, cert denied 423 US 950) where application of the mandatory prison sentence is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment. This contention is without merit. Although the incident in question was defendant\u2019s first criminal offense, other than a shoplifting charge which was adjourned in contemplation of dismissal in 1977, and defendant is a widow who supports her six-year-old child, the fact remains that defendant admitted knowingly agreeing to participate in a drug transaction in order to make money. The facts underlying the crime were that defendant participated in the sale of 27.62 grams of cocaine for $2,600. Under the circumstances, County Court correctly denied defendant\u2019s request that the mandatory prison sentence not be imposed.\nFinally, defendant contends that CPL 220.10 and 220.30 (3) (b) (viii) violate her due process rights because the statutes restricted her ability to plea bargain based on the level of the crime charged. In this regard, a defendant charged with a class A-II drug felony may not be allowed to plead guilty to any charge lower than a class B felony (CPL 220.10, 220.30 [3] [b] [viii]). A defendant, however, has no right to plead guilty except to the entire indictment (People v Felix, 87 AD2d 529, 531 [Lupiano, J., concurring], affd 58 NY2d 156, appeal dismissed 464 US 802; see, CPL 220.10 [1]). Therefore, the Legislature may properly limit the level down to which a defendant may plead guilty (see, People v Felix, 58 NY2d 156, 162, n 3). In this case, defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged and she was sentenced in accordance with the constraints of the sentencing provision of the lesser charge (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00). The judgment should be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal from the County Court of Chemung County concerns the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance after she pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain. Despite her arguments that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional and that her due process rights were violated by plea bargaining restrictions, the court affirmed the judgment, stating that the defendant knowingly participated in the drug transaction and that the sentencing guidelines were appropriately applied. The court concluded that the mandatory sentence was valid and that the legislative limits on plea bargaining do not infringe on due process rights.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sales of a controlled substance in the third degree, possession of stolen property and possession of a weapon. On May 16, 1975, he pleaded guilty to one count of sale of a controlled substance in full satisfaction of the four-count indictment. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one year to life, the minimum sentence available. This appeal ensued and defendant urges reversal on the grounds (1) that his plea of guilty was improperly received; (2) a hearing should have been conducted to determine whether he was entitled to be sentenced to probation; and (3) the first two counts of the indictment should be dismissed because the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under the statutes is unconstitutional. This latter issue has already been passed upon by our courts and the statutes held constitutional. (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). The remaining issues have been examined by us and found unpersuasive. The record reveals that the court carefully questioned the defendant about the facts and circumstances surrounding the count of the indictment to which defendant pleaded guilty. The record further reveals that the court fully advised defendant of his rights and he understood what he was doing when he entered his plea of guilty. Finally, the record clearly demonstrates that the court informed defendant prior to sentence that the minimum sentence would be imposed unless the District Attorney recommended special treatment pursuant to section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law. No such promise or recommendation was made. Consequently, the judgment should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed. Sweeney, J.

As a part of his guilty plea, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. Defendant now contends that his waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and that the sentence he received is harsh and excessive.\nDefendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction; he has therefore failed to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea for review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662; People v Schouenborg, 188 AD2d 625; People v Linares, 174 AD2d 847, lv denied 78 NY2d 969).

Given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a nine-count indictment, pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, has a prior criminal history and was not given the harshest possible sentence, there is no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).\nWeiss, P.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, sentencing was adjourned and defendant was allowed to sign a contract to participate in a drug court program. It was understood that if defendant abided by the conditions of the contract, which included him completing the drug court program and not violating the law prior to the final disposition of the matter, he would be allowed to withdraw his plea and enter a plea to a misdemeanor. After completing the drug court program, but prior to being given an opportunity to withdraw his plea, defendant relapsed on several occasions and was also cited for driving without a license. Defendant thereafter filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to withdraw his plea to the felony charge pursuant to the plea agreement. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant pursuant to the felony conviction to time served and five years of probation. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant contends that by successfully completing the drug court program, he fulfilled his obligation pursuant to the contract and, therefore, he should have been allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. The record reflects, however, that by signing the contract, defendant affirmed that he \u201cunderstood] that even after [he] complete[s] drug court [he] must appear at all court dates and avoid further violations of the law until this matter is disposed of finally.\u201d Defendant also affirmed his understanding that if he \u201cviolate [s] the law prior to final disposition of this matter, the [c]ourt will determine the appropriate sentence for the felony charge.\u201d Although defendant successfully completed the drug court program, he subsequently used illegal drugs prior to the final disposition of the matter. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that County Court erred in sentencing defendant pursuant to the felony conviction, despite his successful completion of the drug court program (see People v Hicks, 98 NY2d 185, 189 [2002]; People v Coffey, 77 AD3d 1202, 1203-1204 [2010], lv denied 18 NY3d 882 [2012]).\nMcCarthy, J.P., Lynch, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nOn August 5, 2014, defendant admitted to violating the terms of his probation by using Oxycodone and dropping out of a treatment program. County Court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and resentenced him to IV3 to 4 years in prison.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appeal concerns a defendant who pleaded guilty to grand larceny in the fourth degree and entered a drug court program under a plea agreement that allowed him to withdraw his plea for a misdemeanor if he complied with the program and stayed law-abiding. Despite completing the program, the defendant violated the law by relapsing and driving without a license before the final disposition, leading the County Court to deny his motion to withdraw the plea and impose a felony sentence. The appellate court affirmed the original judgment, stating the defendant's violations justified the sentencing decision. Subsequently, the defendant admitted to further violations of probation, resulting in a revocation and a new prison sentence.<|eot_id|>"}

On appeal, she contends, inter alia, that CPL 410.91, which creates a sentencing option of parole supervision for a defendant with a history of controlled substance dependence, deprives her of equal protection of the law because she is not a drug-dependent individual. We rejected this argument in People v Kinch (237 AD2d 830, 831, lv denied 90 NY2d 860), wherein we observed that: \u201cIn view of the current nationwide drug crisis and the criminal conduct engendered thereby, it cannot be seriously argued that legislation targeting drug-dependent individuals and providing for intensive drug treatment in lieu of incarceration does not bear a reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective\u201d (id., at 831).

With the low level of defendant\u2019s education, his tubercular condition at the time, and the willingness of the prosecutor to accept a lesser plea on the assumption that defendant was not a fourth offender, it is manifest the plea was not given or accepted with knowledge of the relevant circumstances. (Cf. Jones v. United States, 440 F. 2d 466.)\nOn the appeal in the criminal action, the order should be reversed, the sentence vacated and defendant permitted to withdraw the plea of guilty to attempt to possess narcotics with intent to sell taken May 26, 1965.\nThe appeal from the order in the habeas corpus proceeding should be dismissed on the ground an appeal does not lie in the absence of permission.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court found that both the defendant and the legal parties involved were unaware that the defendant was a fourth-felony offender at the time of his guilty plea, leading to a mutual mistake of fact and law.

County Court advised defendant that it would not be bound by its sentencing promise if he was arrested before sentencing. Defendant was in fact arrested, and the court scheduled a hearing to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for the arrest (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713). The prosecutor and defense counsel advised the court of the circumstances of defendant\u2019s arrest and their respective positions regarding its legitimacy. The prosecutor sought an enhanced sentence of 10 to 20 years. As a result of further negotiations, defendant was permitted to plead guilty to a superior court information (SCI) charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (\u00a7 220.16 [1]) in connection with the arrest pending sentencing. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to concurrent terms of 7 to 14 years on each of the two counts and on the SCI. Defendant waived his right to appeal with respect to both pleas of guilty, and those waivers encompass his contention that the sentences are unduly harsh and sever\u00e9 (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Young, 281 AD2d 950, 950-951, lv denied 96 NY2d 909). In any event, that contention lacks merit.\nWe reject the further contention of defendant that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to proceed with an Outley hearing, the outcome of which may have altered his decision to plead guilty to the SCI. \u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he * * * receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u201d (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404). The court was not required to conduct a hearing, and here defendant was properly afforded an \u201copportunity to show that the arrest [was] without foundation\u201d (Outley, 80 NY2d at 713). Defense counsel successfully negotiated lesser enhanced sentences than those sought by the People and obtained an advantageous plea agreement on the SCI.\nThe waiver by defendant of the right to appeal with respect to the first plea of guilty encompasses his present challenge to the factual sufficiency of that plea allocution (see People v DeJesus, 248 AD2d 1023, lv denied 92 NY2d 878). In any event, defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and thus failed to preserve his contention for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Defendant also failed to preserve for our review his contention that his first plea of guilty was not knowing and voluntary (see id.) and, in any event, that contention lacks merit.

The court concluded that the defendant's waivers of appeal rights were valid and encompassed his challenges regarding the plea allocution and its voluntariness.<|eot_id|>"}

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered May 5, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of conspiracy in the fourth degree.\nWhile defendant was incarcerated in Franklin Correctional Facility in Franklin County, an indictment was returned against him charging him with the crimes of promoting prison contraband in the first degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree for allegedly arranging with an accomplice to smuggle some marihuana and heroin into the facility. Ultimately, defendant entered a counseled Alford plea of guilty to the charge of conspiracy in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2 to 4 years in prison and this appeal ensued.\nInitially, defendant argues that County Court erred in accepting his guilty plea in the face of his protestations of innocence during the allocution. We note, however, that due to defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution has not been preserved for appeal (see, People v Gray, 239 AD2d 713, 714, Iv denied 90 NY2d 893). In any event, were we to reach the merits, we would affirm because \u201cit is not necessary that a defendant admit guilt when entering an Alford plea provided the plea is informed and intelligent\u201d (People v White, 214 AD2d 811, 812, Iv denied 86 NY2d 742). Our review of the plea minutes reveals that County Court thoroughly reviewed the ramifications of the plea with defendant who clearly responded that he wished to enter an Alford plea to avoid the risk of trial and the possibility of receiving greater prison exposure if convicted (see, id.). Defendant further indicated that he was acting freely and voluntarily after a complete discussion of the matter with his counsel. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to vacate the plea in the interest of justice.\nWith respect to defendant\u2019s sentence, we further reject defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive. No promise of a more lenient sentence was made and, given defendant\u2019s criminal history and County Court\u2019s considerable discretion, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.\nCrew III, Yesawich Jr., Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of conspiracy in the fourth degree following his Alford plea, despite his claims of innocence during the allocution.

He pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to an agreement by which he would be granted youthful offender treatment and sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. Defendant was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing and the promised disposition was made contingent upon his reporting back to court for sentencing; if defendant was arrested prior to sentencing on a Penal Law violation, the agreed-to disposition would be nullified and he would be subject to a harsher sentence.\nOn the date of sentencing it appeared that defendant had been arrested and indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. Defense counsel responded that defendant pleaded not guilty to that charge, that he maintained his innocence, that his arrest was completely out of his control and that he had not done anything. County Court disregarded those statements and, based upon the subsequent arrest, denied defendant youthful offender treatment and sentenced him to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.\nThe sentence must be vacated. When defendant disputed the validity of the subsequent arrest and criminal charge, County Court should have afforded him the opportunity to refute the subsequent charge at a presentence conference (see, People v Banks, 161 AD2d 957, 957-958).\nWeiss, P.

Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree. He was sentenced to a five-year term of probation. On this appeal his major contention is that he was entrapped, as a matter of law, as defined by section 40.05 of the Penal Law, and, consequently, the verdict should be reversed and the indictment dismissed. Proof offered ;by the prosecution consisted mainly of the testimony of a State Trooper who worked as an undercover agent and of an informer. The record reveals that there are contradictions in the testimony of the two prosecution witnesses and also between their testimony and the proof offered by the defendant. This, however, created only questions of fact and credibility for the jury to determine. They were implicitly determined against the defendant. An examination of the record in its entirety convinces us that there was sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that defendant failed to establish the defense of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. The record, in our view, also contains ample proof to justify a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty with the understanding that the recommended sentence would be capped at 2 to 6 years in prison. Sentencing was deferred, however, to allow defendant to participate in a Drug Court program. After defendant twice absconded from Drug Court, he was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. Defendant now appeals.\nInsofar as defendant waived his right to appeal and failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim that his guilty plea was not voluntarily made is not preserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075,1075 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 923 [2007]). Furthermore, as there is nothing in the record which casts significant doubt on his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea, no exception to the preservation rule applies (see People v Wagoner, 30 AD3d 629, 629 [2006]; People v Van Bramer, 26 AD3d 672, 673 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]). In any event, defendant\u2019s contention, that he entered his plea without full knowledge of its consequences and was unaware that violating the Drug Court program would lead to a prison sentence, is belied by the fact that County Court fully advised him of the rights he was relinquishing as a result of his plea and ascertained that he understood those rights and that the Drug Court participation agreement he signed at allocution clearly outlined the ramifications of failing to complete the program. Therefore, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made (see People v Escalante, 16 AD3d 984, 985 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]; People v Burdo, 1 AD3d 793, 794 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]).\nSimilarly, defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment rendered his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as it relates to the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea unpreserved for review (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; People v Fogarty, 35 AD3d 957, 958 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 922 [2007]). Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s arguments focus on counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate the circumstances of his case, which lies outside the record, defendant\u2019s claims are more properly suited to a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Douglas, 38 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 843 [2007]). Finally, defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Sawyer, 41 AD3d 1089,1090 [2007]; People v Smith, 37 AD3d 975, 976 [2007]).\nCrew III, J.P., Peters, Mugglin and Rose, JJ., concur.

The defendant waived his right to appeal and did not move to withdraw his plea, which rendered his claims regarding the plea's voluntariness and ineffective assistance of counsel unpreserved for review. Additionally, the court found no significant doubts regarding his guilt or the knowledge of plea consequences, and the appeal was denied.<|eot_id|>"}

While this charge was pending, defendant sought treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse and successfully completed several programs. Defendant thereafter accepted a plea agreement which permitted him to enter a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class C felony, with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nAt sentencing, defense counsel asked County Court to consider imposing a more lenient sentence in light of defendant\u2019s significant progress in conquering his problems with substance abuse. Defense counsel submitted a memorandum detailing the course of treatment defendant pursued following his arrest and also a favorable report from defendant\u2019s employer. In addition, the presentence report recommended that defendant be sentenced to a six-month term of incarceration and an appropriate term of probation. County Court, however, declined to deviate from the negotiated plea agreement and this appeal by defendant ensued.\nOn appeal, defendant claims that County Court did not exercise its discretion in sentencing defendant because it erroneously considered itself bound to adhere to the terms of the plea agreement (citing, inter alia, People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822). In our view, however, the transcript of the sentencing hearing indicates that County Court recognized that it retained discretion in sentencing defendant, but chose not to deviate from the agreed upon term of imprisonment.\nWe also reject defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was well aware of defendant\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation and we cannot agree that the court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence consistent with the terms of the plea agreement constituted an abuse of discretion (see, People v Smith, 154 AD2d 840; People v Lewis, 116 AD2d 778, 779).\nJudgment affirmed.

County Court informed defendant that he would be sentenced to 2 to 6 years in prison and released defendant on his own recognizance, indicating that defendant\u2019s failure to appear for sentencing would constitute a violation of the plea agreement and authorize the court to impose a harsher prison sentence of up to 15 years. Defendant did not appear for sentencing on the appointed date and County Court ultimately sentenced him in absentia to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.\nInitially, we note that defendant has failed to preserve by appropriate motion his contention that the waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary (see People v Kirkland, 2 AD3d 1063, 1063 [2003]; People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 685 [2003]). In any event, were we to consider defendant\u2019s claims, we would conclude that the waiver was entirely proper. County Court extensively questioned defendant regarding his willingness to enter into the plea agreement and understanding of the consequences, including the relinquishment of his right to pursue an appeal. Defendant\u2019s answers to every question posed by the court were unequivocal, giving no indication that he did not comprehend the terms of the waiver or any other aspect of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the plea and waiver were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Barrett, 301 AD2d 790, 790-791 [2003]; People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513 [1998]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the court was not required to engage in any specific litany during the allocution (see People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 910-911 [1990]); nor did the fact that the waiver was unwritten render the plea deficient (see People v Willis, 2 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2003]).\nWe further reject defendant\u2019s contention that County Court impermissibly enhanced his sentence after he failed to appear for sentencing. Following its acceptance of defendant\u2019s plea, County Court issued a Parker admonishment expressly inform - ing defendant that his failure to appear for sentencing would amount to a breach of the plea agreement, releasing the court from its promise of a lighter sentence (see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141-142 [1982]; People v Waldron, 257 AD2d 771 [1999]). Further, County Court adjourned the proceedings twice in an effort to locate defendant and ascertain the reason for his absence. In our view, County Court did not err in imposing the enhanced sentence in defendant\u2019s absence (see People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713, 714 [2000]; People v Sumner, 254 AD2d 537, 537-538 [1998]).\nCrew III, Carpinello, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

The County Court sentenced the defendant to 4 to 12 years in prison after he failed to appear for sentencing, which was deemed a breach of the plea agreement. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, finding that the plea and waiver were made knowingly and voluntarily, and that the sentence enhancement was justified due to the defendant's absence.<|eot_id|>"}

At sentencing, defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4V2 to 9 years. Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal (see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]).\nUpon our review of the record, we perceive at least one issue of arguable merit regarding the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal (see People v Lewis, 29 AD3d 1076, 1076-1077 [2006]; People v Santalucia, 9 AD3d 740, 740-741 [2004]; see also People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 555-556 [2006]), and a determination of the enforceability of defendant\u2019s waiver may bring up for review any meritorious issues regarding, among other things, the pretrial procedures and hearings and the four-day trial which resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction (see People v Santalucia, 9 AD3d at 740; see also Matter of Taylor v Fry, 42 AD3d 680, 681 [2007]).

Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison and this appeal ensued.\nInitially, insofar as the record discloses that defendant entered into a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal in connection with the plea agreement (see, People v Muniz, 215 AD2d 881, 883), we find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that this waiver should be given no effect. In any event, although defendant now challenges the restitution ordered to reimburse funds expended in the \"buy and bust\u201d operation leading to his conviction, we note that defendant expressly agreed to this amount (see, People v Serafini, 213 AD2d 1066, lv denied 85 NY2d 980). Further, we find no reason to conclude that the subject order of restitution pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (9) was illegal simply because it was the District Attorney\u2019s office that originally provided the funds that were expended by the law enforcement personnel involved in the undercover operation. In our view the legislative purpose of \"preventing] convicted narcotics offenders from reaping a windfall\u201d (Mem of Senate Sponsor, L 1991, ch 545, 1991 NY Legis Ann, at 300) was fulfilled in this case. Finally, we have examined defendant\u2019s claim that his negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive and find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Martin, 215 AD2d 942, 942-943).\nMercure, J.

In any event, a review of the record discloses that the original plea agreement was modified, with the consent and knowledge of the defendant and the prosecutor, at a subsequent hearing on the defendant\u2019s application to be released on her own recognizance pending sentence, in order to enable her to visit her gravely ill sister and to begin a drug rehabilitation program. Bail had been previ ously set at $10,000. In determining the application, the court properly considered, pursuant to CPL 510.30 (2) (a), alternative \"kind[s] and degreefs] of control or restriction\u201d that were necessary to secure the defendant\u2019s attendance at sentence. To accomplish this purpose, the court clearly conditioned the promised sentence, inter alia, upon the defendant\u2019s appearance on the date scheduled for sentencing and upon her cooperation with a T.A.S.C. (Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) caseworker, including her enrollment and attendance in a drug rehabilitation program. The defendant acknowledged that she understood that if she did not comply with these conditions, the court would impose a harsher sentence than that promised in consideration of her plea of guilty. Thereafter, the defendant failed to fulfill either condition and she was arrested on a bench warrant. The proffered explanation for her noncompliance was incredible, unsubstantiated and insufficient. Accordingly, the court was free to impose a more severe sentence, which was not excessive (see, People v Moore, supra; People v Caridi, 148 AD2d 625; People v Betheny, 147 AD2d 488; People v Raife, 146 AD2d 652; cf., People v Rosenberg, 148 AD2d 346; People v Clarke, 145 AD2d 565; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709; see also, Innes v Dalsheim, 864 F2d 974).

In any event, our examination of the plea minutes reveals that County Court (Rosen, J.) properly ascertained that defendant was entering the plea free of duress and coercion, he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he had discussed the matter with defense counsel, was satisfied with the services he was provided and he understood the rights he was relinquishing as a result of the plea (see People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]; People v Hill, 11 AD3d 817, 817-818 [2004]; People v Grier, 11 AD3d 816, 816-817 [2004]).\nWith respect to defendant\u2019s attack upon the sufficiency of the plea allocution, we note that defendant was not required to independently recite the facts underlying the crime to which he pleaded guilty where his affirmative and unequivocal responses to County Court\u2019s inquiry did not otherwise signal doubt regarding his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Mahar, 12 AD3d 715, 716 [2004]; People v Snare, 11 AD3d 823, 824 [2004]; People v Pringle, 10 AD3d 802, 803 [2004]). Accordingly, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was in all respects voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Defendant\u2019s remaining argument that his sentence is harsh and excessive is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Valentino, 10 AD3d 800, 801 [2004]).\nPeters, Carpinello, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

The court found the plea was voluntary and knowing, and the defendant's challenges regarding the plea's voluntariness and the severity of the sentence were deemed unpreserved or foreclosed by his waiver of appeal rights.<|eot_id|>"}

County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence of seven years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea, and defendant acknowledged that he understood the ramifications of the waiver and executed a written waiver in open court. Accordingly, we conclude that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Neithardt, 127 AD3d 1502, 1502 [2015]; People v Brown, 125 AD3d 1049, 1049 [2015]). The valid appeal waiver precludes his claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Almeida, 127 AD3d 1499, 1500 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1006 [2015]; People v Turner, 126 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2015]), as well as his challenge to County Court\u2019s denial of his application to redact certain information contained in the presentence investigation report (see People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]; People v Abdul, 112 AD3d 644, 645 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014] ).\nDefendant\u2019s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that the plea allocution was not factually sufficient are not preserved for our review as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015]; People v Martin, 125 AD3d 1054, 1054 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 932 [2015]). Defendant \u201cmade no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this matter within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement\u201d (People v Pickett, 128 AD3d at 1276).\nFinally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was illegally sentenced as a second violent felony offender, although he correctly notes that the People submitted a predicate felony offender statement that erroneously indicated that he was subject to being sentenced as a second violent felony offender (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.04 [1] [a]). The sentencing minutes reflect that County Court properly sentenced defendant as a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [4] [b] [i]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d 880, 881 n [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1040 [2013]). While the judgment is therefore affirmed, we note that the uniform sentence and commitment form incorrectly reflects that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender and it must be amended to reflect his status as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1472 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d at 881 n).\nPeters, P.J., Garry, Egan Jr. and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and matter remitted for entry of an amended uniform sentence and commitment form.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal. The court found that the waiver was valid and that the defendant's claims regarding his plea and sentencing were not preserved for review. Additionally, although there was an error in the predicate felony offender statement, the court concluded that the sentencing was appropriate as he was correctly identified as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction, and it ordered an amendment to the sentencing form to reflect this status.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, with a recommendation that he be allowed to participate in a shock incarceration program. He now appeals and we affirm.\nInitially, defendant contends and the People concede that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Upon our review of the record, we share that view (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006]). For that reason, we have considered defendant\u2019s further assertion that his sentence was harsh and excessive, yet find it to be unpersuasive. Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the agreed-upon sentence was statutorily permissible and, given his criminal background and the nature of his crime, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion or that any extraordinary circumstances are present which would warrant a reduction of the sentence (see People v Wallach, 35 AD3d 913, 914 [2006]; People v Milner, 28 AD3d 873, 874 [2006]).\nMercure, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Additionally, defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and acknowledged, after receiving instructions from County Court and signing a Parker admonishment, that his sentence could be enhanced if he was involved in another violation of the law before sentencing. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested and indicted for criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, involving the sale of cocaine to an undercover officer. Following an evidentiary hearing, County Court determined that the prosecution established sufficient grounds to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence and consequently sentenced defendant to a prison term of 6 to 18 years. Subsequently, with respect to the second indictment, defendant entered a plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison term of 6V2 to 19V2 years to run concurrent with the prior sentence. Defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was subsequently sentenced as agreed. Defendant now appeals from both judgments.\nWe affirm. An agreed-upon sentence may be enhanced if it is appropriately established that the defendant has violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Baxter, 302 AD2d 950, 951 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]; People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63, 69 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 967 [2000]). Here, defendant contends that County Court lacked the authority to impose an enhanced sentence since defendant did hot violate any condition of the Parker admonishment or the plea bargain agreement. At the time that defendant entered his plea, he acknowledged, in relevant part, that he understood the court\u2019s oral instruction that if he were to be involved in the commission of another crime, the sentence could be enhanced. Additionally, defendant executed a written Parker admonishment which provided, in relevant part, that \u201cif you violate the law before being sentenced . . . the Court will be free to sentence you to any lawful sentence the Court feels appropriate.\u201d Specifically, defendant asserts that he was never advised that simply being arrested could result in the enhancement of the agreed-upon sentence. It is defendant\u2019s position that under the terms of the Parker admonishment and plea bargain agreement, the sentence could not be enhanced unless and until it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed another crime.\nAny inconsistency between the terms of the written Parker admonishment and the oral instructions of the trial court must be resolved in favor of the defendant (see Spence v Superintendent, Great Meadow Correctional Facility, 219 F3d 162, 169 [2000]). Notwithstanding County Court\u2019s misstatement regarding the proof necessary to establish a predicate for enhancement of the sentence\u2014\u201carrest\u201d rather than a \u201cviolation of the law\u201d (see People v Clough, 306 AD2d 556, 556-557 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]), we conclude that the testimony of the undercover officer that she purchased cocaine from defendant satisfactorily established that defendant violated the law. Under these circumstances, enhancement of the sentence was proper.\nTurning to defendant\u2019s argument that his plea of guilty under the second indictment was not voluntary, we note that he did not move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction. Under these circumstances, any challenge to the voluntariness of the plea has not been preserved for our review (see People v Booth [I], 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005], lvs denied 6 NY3d 846, 849 [2006]; People v Santalucia, 19 AD3d 806, 807 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 856 [2005]). In any event, were we to reach the issue, we would conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge is meritless since the plea colloquy unquestionably establishes that defendant knew and understood the consequences of his plea and that he committed the elements of the offense charged (see People v Cherry, 12 AD3d 949, 949 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 797 [2005]). Defendant\u2019s present claim of innocence is wholly unsubstantiated, providing no basis upon which to vacate the plea (see People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711 [1999]).\nThe two remaining contentions of defendant are equally unpersuasive. Defendant\u2019s contention that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing before County Court to determine whether he had violated the law does not survive his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Williams, 17 AD3d 783, 784 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 796 [2005]). In any event, the record demonstrates effectiveness as the Public Defender made appropriate objections, conducted meaningful examinations of witnesses and offered a persuasive argument in defendant\u2019s favor (see People v Kyzer, 21 AD3d 1212, 1213-1214 [2005]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that the provisions of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act should be retroactively applied to reduce his sentences (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [a], [b]) has previously been rejected. The provisions of the law, with an exception not here applicable, are prospective only (see People v Clinton, 22 AD3d 887, 888 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 811 [2006]).\nCardona, EJ., Spain, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgments convicting the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance, following his guilty pleas. Despite the defendant's argument that his sentence could not be enhanced due to a lack of proof of a law violation, the court found sufficient evidence of his criminal conduct, justifying the sentence increase. Additionally, the court ruled that the defendant's claims regarding the voluntariness of his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel were unpersuasive, as he did not preserve these issues for review and the record indicated competent legal representation.<|eot_id|>"}

H Defendant was convicted after trial of selling LSD to an undercover State Police investigator and pleaded guilty to bail jumping in the first degree. He was sentenced to concurrent indefinite terms of imprisonment of five years to life for the drug sale and one to four years for bail jumping. Defendant contends that on this appeal that the affirmative defense of entrapment was established as a matter of law at the trial and, although he failed to raise the defense affirmatively as required by law, he is entitled nonetheless to a reversal. Defendant neither interposed the defense of entrapment nor offered proof thereof and he failed to request a charge on the issue. We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence presented proves entrapment as a matter of law. The conduct of the police agent did not rise to the level of \u201cactive inducement or encouragement\u201d as required by section 40.05 of the Penal Law (see People v Seale, 47 NY2d 923). Having failed to raise the defense at trial, defendant is foreclosed from litigating the issue for the first time on appeal (see People v Irby, 61 AD2d 386, 400, mod on other grounds 47 NY2d 894). H We also find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that section 220.00 (subd 1) of the Penal Law is unconstitutionally vague. The statute is clear on its face and sets out in unambiguous language what acts are proscribed. We also find that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive under the circumstances. The transgression was a serious one and defendant\u2019s disregard of the law is further evidenced by his bail jumping. We decline to substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing court under these circumstances. \u00b6 Judgments affirmed. Mahoney, P.

Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment and another pending five-count indictment, as well as any other charges pending against defendant in Montgomery County. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed, which is less than the harshest possible sentence.

Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender, in accordance with the agreement, to a seven-year prison term followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision and now appeals.\nWe affirm. To begin, we find that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see also People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]). County Court thoroughly advised defendant of the constitutional rights being forfeited upon a guilty plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]), and then asked whether, \u201cseparate and apart, independent of the trial rights you give up by virtue of the plea, do you understand [that] the plea bargain requires that you give up your right to appeal the conviction as well as the sentence that I will impose here?\u201d Defendant responded in the affirmative. This colloquy confirms that defendant was duly apprised of the distinction between the rights automatically forfeited upon a plea and the additional requirement here of an appeal waiver. Given defendant\u2019s valid appeal waiver, his challenge to the severity of the sentence is foreclosed (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]).\nDefendant\u2019s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that counsel failed to provide effective assistance with respect to the plea survive the appeal waiver, but were not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion, and no statements were made during the plea colloquy triggering the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015]). Recognizing as much in his brief, defendant seeks to have us vacate the plea in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [a]). We are not persuaded to do so.\nThe majority of defendant\u2019s claims concern matters that are outside the record on appeal, such as what counsel discussed with or provided to him, and are more properly raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Taylor, 135 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2016]). Further, a review of the plea allocution demonstrates that defendant was adequately informed of the plea terms and the rights that he was foregoing, that he understood the consequences of his plea and had sufficient time to discuss the proof against him and possible defenses with counsel. Defendant confirmed that he was pleading guilty of his own free will and unequivocally admitted the charged conduct. Moreover, defendant expressed satisfaction with counsel, who negotiated a favorable plea deal to a single sale count for which defendant received a sentence well below the maximum possible consecutive sentences if he had been convicted on each of the cocaine sales (see Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 70.25 [3]; 70.70 [1] [b]; [3] [b] [i]). That defendant opted to plead guilty, confirming that he had sold cocaine even though the lab test results may not have been available to him, does not compromise the viability of the plea. As such, were these issues properly before us, we would find that they lack merit.\nLahtinen, J.P., Rose, Clark and Aarons, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the judgment of the County Court of Albany County, which convicted the defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following a guilty plea. The defendant's appeal was denied due to a valid waiver of his right to appeal and his failure to preserve claims regarding the voluntariness of the plea and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that the plea process was adequately explained to the defendant, and he voluntarily admitted to the charged conduct, leading to a sentence that was below the maximum potential penalties.<|eot_id|>"}

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 22, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.\nIn October 2013, defendant was arrested after the police, who had observed him with a marihuana cigarette in a vehicle with a codefendant, found a stolen, loaded .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol hidden under his seat. Defendant was subsequently charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. While released on bail awaiting trial on this indictment, defendant was again arrested in February 2014 after police found him inside a motel room with, among other things, approximately 32 grams of heroin, two digital scales, 900 empty glassine envelopes and an air gun replica revolver, and he was charged in a superior court information with, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Thereafter, pursuant to a plea agreement encompassing both accusatory instruments, defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with a commitment that County Court would impose a prison sentence with a range of 3V2 to 12 years for the weapons conviction and a maximum of nine years for the drug conviction, with his sentences for each conviction to be served concurrently. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 12 years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision, for his conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and nine years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant now appeals, contending that the waiver of his right to appeal was invalid and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.\nWe agree with defendant that he did not validly waive the right to appeal. County Court failed to distinguish \u201cthat the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u2019 (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]). Moreover, although defendant executed a written waiver of appeal, he did not do so in open court, and our review of the record establishes that County Court did not \u201censure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver\u201d (People v Williams, 132AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]).\nNotwithstanding, we disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that the aggregate sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty to the crimes at issue with full knowledge of the sentencing range that would be imposed and that the sentences were to run concurrently. He was then sentenced in accordance with that agreement. The first charge involved defendant\u2019s illegal possession of a loaded, stolen handgun and, despite that arrest, while out on bail on those charges, defendant then chose to commit another felony by possessing, among other things, a large quantity of heroin and other drug paraphernalia. While mindful that defendant has no prior criminal history and expressed remorse for his crimes, in light of the seriousness of the offenses committed, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Gunn, 144 AD3d 1193, 1196 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1145 [2017]; People v Smith, 100 AD3d 1144, 1144 [2012]).\nGarry, J.P., Rose, Mulvey and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, following a guilty plea. The court found that the waiver of the right to appeal was invalid due to a lack of proper explanation and execution, but upheld the sentence as appropriate given the seriousness of the offenses committed, despite the defendant's lack of prior criminal history and expression of remorse. The judgment was ultimately affirmed.<|eot_id|>"}

Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to a maximum of six years in prison to be followed by anywhere from 3 to 5 years of postrelease supervision. Prior to sentencing, it was agreed that sentencing would be held in abeyance pending defendant\u2019s participation in a substance abuse treatment program, the successful completion of which would entitle him to withdraw his plea, plead guilty to a misdemeanor and be sentenced to time served. Defendant failed to successfully complete the program and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. He now appeals.\nDefense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, defense counsel\u2019s brief and defendant\u2019s pro se submission, we agree. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal. Inasmuch as he did not satisfactorily complete the substance abuse treatment program, he was not entitled to a reduced sentence. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed and counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).\nCardona, P.J., Mercure, Spain, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

In our view defendant\u2019s arguments to reverse the conviction or to modify the sentence are without merit. The judgment of conviction should therefore be affirmed.\nDefendant and others were charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree arising out of two separate sales of cocaine to undercover police officers, one on January 8, 1988 and the other on January 13, 1988. Defendant was acquitted of the January 8, 1988 charge and convicted of the January 13, 1988 charge (count 2 of the indictment). The underlying facts can be found in this court\u2019s affirmance of the conviction of one of defendant\u2019s codefendants (see, People v Solis, 173 AD2d 1089, lv denied 78 NY2d 974,1081).\nViewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the People, as we must (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the criminal activity charged in the second count of the indictment (see, People v Williams, 79 NY2d 803, affg on opn below 172 AD2d 448). The jury had before it evidence that defendant resided with the codefendants in the room where the sale occurred, was present on January 11, 1988 when arrangements for the January 13, 1988 sale were made and again at the time of the sale, and picked up and counted the purchase money after it was placed on a television by the undercover officer.\nAs to defendant\u2019s second argument, there is insufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication on January 13, 1988 to require an intoxication charge (see, People v Rodriguez, 76 NY2d 918, 920). Further, we do not find the prison sentence imposed of 3 to 9 years to be excessive. It was within the maximum authorized (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and defendant has failed to demonstrate that County Court abused its discretion or that extraordinary circumstances exist which would warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Robinson, 66 AD2d 903; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861).\nWeiss, P. J., Yesawich Jr. and Crew III, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, rejecting his claims of insufficient evidence, improper denial of an intoxication charge, and excessive sentencing. The evidence presented at trial indicated the defendant's involvement in a cocaine sale to undercover officers, and the court found no grounds to modify the sentence of 3 to 9 years, which was within legal limits.<|eot_id|>"}

Prior to sentencing, defendant retained substitute counsel and moved to withdraw his plea, which County Court denied following an extensive inquiry. Sentenced as an admitted second felony offender to the agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 4x/2 to 9 years, defendant now appeals.\nInitially, while defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea preserved some of the involuntariness claims now raised on appeal (see People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806, 807 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 686 [2001]), a review of the plea colloquy demonstrates that County Court fully apprised defendant of his rights and of the consequences of the plea; the court conducted a sufficient inquiry to establish that defendant understood the proceedings, had ample time to confer with counsel and consider the plea offer, and was entering the plea voluntarily (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Barnaby, 30 AD3d 775, 776 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]). Defendant was not required to recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual exposition, as it was sufficient that he provided unequivocal affirmative responses to the court\u2019s questions, never made statements negating his guilt and indicated that he was entering the plea because he was, in fact, guilty (see People v Turner, 27 AD3d 962, 963 [2006]; see also People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]).\nWe find no basis to disturb County Court\u2019s discretionary determination to deny defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780 [2005]; People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664-665 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002]; see also CPL 220.60 [3]; cf. People v D\u2019Adamo, 281 AD2d 751, 752 [2001]). Defendant asserted that his plea was involuntary because he was not receiving prescription medicine for mental health problems at the time of his plea. However, as the court noted in reviewing the plea minutes, there was no indication at the time of the plea that defendant suffered any mental deficiency or inability to think clearly or to. understand the consequences of and voluntarily enter a guilty plea (see People v Criscitello, 32 AD3d 1112, 1113-1114 [2006]; People v Hart, 205 AD2d 943 [1994]; see also People v D'Adamo, supra at 752). In response to the court\u2019s plea inquiry, defendant stated that he was thinking clearly and had not taken any medication, never raising a concern about a lack of medicine. Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea on this ground was based solely upon conclusory affidavits, unsupported by any medical proof, which did not raise a sufficient question of fact regarding the voluntariness of his plea so as to require an evidentiary hearing (see People v Alexander, 97 NY2d 482, 485-486 [2002]; People v Criscitello, supra at 1114; People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 631 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; cf. People v D'Adamo, supra).\nDefendant also alleged that his plea had been induced by a false promise that the related charges against his fianc\u00e9e would be dismissed if he accepted the plea deal. No such promise appears in the plea colloquy, and its existence is belied by his sworn assertion to County Court during the plea proceedings that no other promises had been made to induce his guilty plea. Defendant\u2019s unsworn allegation that trial counsel had made such a promise to him when they conferred during the plea proceedings was unsupported by any evidence despite defendant having the assistance of substitute counsel and an adjournment to substantiate that claim (see People v De Fabritis, supra at 665).\nTurning to defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record reflects that defendant received an advantageous plea to the lower level felony with a sentence commitment that was the minimum possible, and nothing in the record casts doubt upon counsel\u2019s effectiveness (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Defendant\u2019s assertion that trial counsel failed to discuss possible trial defenses is directly refuted by the plea colloquy (see People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]; People v Lahon, 17 AD3d 778, 779 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 790 [2005]).\nFinally, defendant\u2019s challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is unavailing, as he received the minimum permissible second felony offender term of imprisonment for this class B felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and, thus, there is no \u201clegally authorized lesser sentence\u201d (CPL 470.20 [6]; see People v Anderson, 268 AD2d 228, 229 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 792 [2000]). We do not find, as the People urge, that defendant effected a valid waiver of his right to appeal foreclosing his right to challenge the sentence\u2019s severity, as there was only a fleeting reference to an appeal waiver in the plea allocution (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-10 [1989]).\nCardona, PJ., Mercure, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe appellate court affirmed the County Court's judgment convicting the defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after he entered a guilty plea as part of a negotiated agreement. The court found no basis to disturb the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, as he was adequately informed of his rights and the plea's consequences, and there was no evidence supporting claims of involuntariness or ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, the sentence was deemed appropriate, being the minimum permissible for a second felony offender.<|eot_id|>"}

Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive principally due to his troubled upbringing. Notably, where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it shall not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, lv denied 93 NY2d 872). Here, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court.

He subsequently entered a plea of guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. The court promised that if he successfully completed a DTAP program (Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison Program), the plea would be vacated and the indictment would be dismissed. The court warned, however, that if he failed to complete the program, he would face a sentence of 4V2 to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment as a second felony offender. The defendant was fully allocuted and, upon his admission, was adjudicated a second felony offender. He was subsequently discharged from one residential drug treatment program for noncompliance, and left a second residential program without permission and against clinical advice. He was thereafter arrested for another drug sale. The court sentenced him to a term of 4V2 to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe defendant\u2019s purported waiver of his right to appeal from the sentence imposed was ineffective (see People v Brown, 13 AD3d 548 [2004]; People v Williams, 258 AD2d 544 [1999]; People v Rose, 236 AD2d 637 [1997]; People v Rolon, 220 AD2d 543 [1995]). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, however, the sentence was neither unconstitutional nor excessive (see People v Moore, 261 AD2d 421 [1999]; People v James, 251 AD2d 208 [1998]; People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).

County Court thereafter sentenced defendant in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea is not preserved for our review insofar as he failed to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rivera, 20 AD3d 763, 764 [2005]; People v Cash, 19 AD3d 934, 935 [2005]). Moreover, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not offer any statements during the plea allocution which cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Guishard, 15 AD3d 731, 732 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 789 [2005]).\nDefendant\u2019s assertion that his sentence was harsh and exces sive is similarly without merit.

The People presented three eyewitnesses to the sale, i.e., the confidential informant and two police officers who observed the transaction through binoculars (one of whom had known defendant for 15 years), as well as a videotape which clearly captured the transaction and provided an essentially unmistakable means of identifying defendant as the perpetrator of the crime. Further, in view of defendant\u2019s status as a second felony offender and his exposure to a potential prison term of 12V2 to 25 years (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]), we are unpersuaded that the 10 to 20-year prison term imposed by County Court was harsh or excessive.\nPeters, Spain, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur.

Defendant thereafter made pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment and/or to inspect the Grand Jury minutes. He further moved to suppress the identification testimony, and in the event that he decided not to go trial, he moved for leave to enter an Alford/ Serrano plea. All of these motions were ultimately denied by County Court. Defendant then agreed to a plea bargain pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to all three counts of the indictment in exchange for a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. Defendant appeals from the subsequent judgment of conviction.\nDefendant contends that County Court erred by denying his pretrial motions. First, he argues that the pretrial identification procedures involved in having the police witnesses identify defendant from a photo array was unduly suggestive. Our review of the record herein, including the transcript of the Wade hearing, discloses that the photo array identification was not so suggestive as to violate defendant\u2019s due process rights. Although defendant points to various aspects in the testimony of the identifying police officers which he finds inconsistent, such alleged inconsistencies raise issues of credibility that are best resolved by the hearing court (see, People v Cotroneo, 199 AD2d 670, lv denied 83 NY2d 851). Its findings will not be disturbed when, as in the instant matter, they are fully supported by the record (see, People v Mena-Coss, 210 AD2d 745, 746, lv denied 86 NY2d 798; People v Arias, 209 AD2d 862, 863, lv denied 85 NY2d 859).\nCounty Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and/or to inspect the Grand Jury minutes was also appropriate. The court properly determined that the Grand Jury minutes were legally sufficient to support the charges filed against defendant and that defendant had failed to establish a right to inspect them (see, People v Miller, 210 AD2d 724, 726).\nFinally, we decline to disturb County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to file an Alford! Serrano plea. Given the absence of any compelling evidence that defendant was not guilty as charged, such a plea would have been inappropriate (see, People v White, 214 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 86 NY2d 742).\nMercure, J.

The court found no error in denying the defendant's pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment, inspect Grand Jury minutes, and suppress identification testimony, concluding that the identification procedures were not unduly suggestive and that the Grand Jury minutes supported the charges. The court also ruled that an Alford/Serrano plea was inappropriate due to a lack of compelling evidence of the defendant's innocence.<|eot_id|>"}

Judgment affirmed. The defendant was charged in 1976 with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class AII felony, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, then a class A-III felony. In order to bring himself within the potentially beneficial provisions of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law, as it then read, and thus avert imposition of the mandatory sentence of imprisonment upon conviction (see Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 3, par [a], former cl [iii]), the defendant offered to co-operate with drug enforcement authorities. The relevant portion of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law provided that upon recommendation of the District Attorney, and the approval of the sentencing Judge and the Administrative Judge of the district, a defendant convicted of an A-III felony could be sentenced to lifetime probation in lieu of mandatory imprisonment upon meeting enu merated conditions. The record here indicates that such recommendation is not made by the Suffolk County District Attorney unless the drug enforcement authorities write to him that the defendant has co-operated to the fullest extent. Defendant\u2019s efforts at co-operation were directed toward the obtaining of such a letter. Although the defendant\u2019s co-operation led to two class A-l felony drug arrests and prosecutions, the drug enforcement officials refused to submit a letter to the effect that his efforts warranted probation treatment. The reason given for the refusal was the officers\u2019 belief that the defendant had not aided their operation to the best of his ability. The letter that was sent to the District Attorney outlined the extent of cooperation for consideration as to whether the defendant should be permitted to plead guilty to a lesser offense. When he learned that the desired letter would not be forthcoming, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment in the interest of justice pursuant to CPL 210.40, alleging (1) that the drug enforcement officers had promised to send a letter recommending probation to the District Attorney if his co-operation produced two drug \"busts\u201d; and (2) that the District Attorney had promised to recommend lifetime probation at sentencing if the defendant\u2019s co-operation materially assisted in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of another drug felon. At the ensuing hearing, the defendant, drug enforcement officers who work\u00e9d with him, members of the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s office, defendant\u2019s present and former counsel, and a private investigator hired by defense counsel, all testified relative to the issue of the alleged promises of the officers and the District Attorney. The County Court denied the motion, finding that the defendant failed to prove that the District Attorney\u2019s office had made any binding promise to recommend probation to the sentencing court. More specifically, the court found that drug enforcement authorities had stated that they would consider his role in the arrests in evaluating the extent of his co-operation, and that the District Attorney\u2019s office agreed merely to consider a request for lifetime probation upon receipt of a sufficient letter from the undercover police officers. Although the defendant since has pleaded guilty to a class A-III felony and has been resentenced to the minimum imprisonment of one to three years (see Penal Law, \u00a7 60.09, subd b, par [i]), after an original imposition of a mandatory one year to life sentence (see Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 2, par [a]; subd 3, par [a], former cl [iii]), his claim that a promise of leniency had been made to him survives the plea for appellate purposes (see People v Argentine, 67 AD2d 180, after remand 71 AD2d 869; see, also, People v Greco, 69 AD2d 822). Nevertheless, in the absence of a promise broken which might bring the case within the purview of the rule that \"Justice does not allow one agent [of the State] to ignore promises made by the other, whatever the breadth of discretion involved\u201d (Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57, 64), the judgment of conviction cannot be set aside. Dismissal in the interest of justice seems an inappropriate remedy for abuse which may flow from the breadth of discretion vested in the District Attorney by section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law (see. People v Eason, 40 NY2d 297, 302, concurring opn of Wachtler, J.), unless there is prosecutorial misconduct of the serious degree envisioned by the recent amendment to the Clayton statute (see CPL 210.40, subd 1, par [e], L 1979, ch 216, eff Jan. 1, 1980; see, also, People v Kaufman, 77 AD2d 924). The remedy for breach of a promise of recommendation may be enforcement of the promise (see, e.g., Santobello v New York, 404 US 257, on remand 39 AD2d 654; People v Young, 71 AD2d 582; People v Taylor, 64 AD2d 998; People v McFarland, 46 AD2d 616; cf. People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert den 419 US 1122) but even enforcement may not produce the desired sentence of probation (see Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., supra, pp 66-67). Such a recommendation under section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law is a matter within what Judge Wachtler has described as the \"unbridled\u201d discretion of the District Attorney (see People v Eason, supra, p 302; People v Kaufman, supra), and is further subject to approval by both the sentencing Judge and the Administrative Judge of the district. Thus, despite the instant sentencing Judge\u2019s declaration that he would have imposed probation had the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation been forthcoming, he lacked the power to compel the making of such a recommendation and could not have preempted a contrary exercise of discretion by the Administrative Judge (cf. People v Nudelman, 70 AD2d 13, after remand 71 AD2d 1030). Defendant\u2019s allegations concerning the constitutional infirmity of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law already have been passed upon and rejected by the Court of Appeals (see People v Eason, supra). We recognize, nonetheless, that the degree of discretion vested in District Attorneys by the statute may result in abuse and we suggest that the Legislature consider the problem. Accordingly, affirmance is required. Lazer, J. P., Rabin and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur; Gulotta, J., concurs in the result.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance, arguing that he was promised probation in exchange for his cooperation with drug enforcement authorities. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that there was no binding promise made by the District Attorney for probation, and emphasized that the discretion for such recommendations lies solely with the District Attorney, subject to approval by the sentencing judge. The court noted concerns about the potential for abuse of discretion but upheld the judgment due to the absence of a broken promise.<|eot_id|>"}

Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and the People recommended an indeterminate sentence of D/s to 4 years in prison. Supreme Court accepted the People\u2019s recommendation and sentenced defendant accordingly. Defendant appeals, contending that his plea allocution was factually insufficient and that the sentence was harsh and excessive.\nBecause defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review (see People v Greene, 274 AD2d 842, 843, Iv denied 95 NY2d 963; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 797, Iv denied 93 NY2d 980). Inasmuch as nothing said during the colloquy cast significant doubt on defendant\u2019s guilt, the narrow exception to this preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636). In any event, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s contentions. While defendant now asserts that he never admitted possession of or control over the cocaine, our review of the record discloses that during the plea allocution, after being fully informed of his rights, defendant acknowledged that he had knowingly and unlawfully possessed cocaine weighing 500 milligrams or more on the specific date, time and place charged. Therefore, Supreme Court properly accepted his guilty plea.\nMoreover, defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal forecloses his challenge to the severity of his sentence (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763), which was, in any event, validly imposed pursuant to defendant\u2019s plea agreement (see People v Grant, 294 AD2d 671, 672-673). Our review of the rec ord reveals no abuse of discretion by Supreme Court or any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification in the interest of justice (see People v Vazquez, 284 AD2d 730, 730).\nCardona, P.J., Rose, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur.

While these charges were pending, defendant was arrested and indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on a charge of conspiracy to violate the narcotics laws of the United States (see, 21 USC \u00a7 841 [a] [1]; \u00a7 846) based upon his alleged drug-related activities from 1992 to November 19, 1996 \u201cin the Southern District of New York and elsewhere.\u201d\nOn December 8, 1998, pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. He expressly waived his right to appeal and agreed to be sentenced to a State prison term of 3\u00a52 to 7 years. It was further agreed that, if defendant were sentenced on the Federal offenses prior to sentencing on the State charge, the State sentence would run concurrently. The following colloquy occurred:\n\u201cThe Court: And it\u2019s also my understanding, * * * that this federal charge hasn\u2019t been disposed of.\n\u201c[Defense counsel]: That\u2019s correct. That charge is still pending.\n\u201cThe Court: Thus Criminal Procedure Law Section 40.20 does not apply.\n\u201c[Defense counsel]: Yes.\u201d\nIn January 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to the Federal conspiracy charge for which, in September 1999, he was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 168 months.\n. In December 1999, defendant moved to vacate his plea to the State charges and to dismiss the indictment by asserting a violation of CPL 40.20, and NY Constitution, article I, \u00a7 6. Supreme Court denied the motion, concluding that while the conduct upon which the State indictment was grounded was encompassed within the time frame of the Federal conspiracy charge, there existed no double jeopardy. It reasoned that defendant\u2019s guilty plea constituted a conviction and that the sentence levied constituted a judgment upon the conviction. Having entered a plea to the State charge before pleading to the Federal charge, it found that no claim of double jeopardy could be asserted under State law. Sentenced on February 18, 2000 as a second felony offender to the previously agreed upon prison term of 3V2 to 7 years, defendant now appeals, asserting claims of double jeopardy and ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWe affirm. Since defendant entered his plea of guilty to the State charge with full knowledge of the provisions of CPL 40.20, his plea constituted a forfeiture of any claim predicated upon a violation of that statute (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, 219, cert denied 475 US 1150). Similarly waived was defendant\u2019s constitutional double jeopardy claim based upon the content of his plea allocution which demonstrated \u201ca knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, intended comprehensively to cover all aspects of the case\u201d (People v Muniz, 91 NY2d 570, 575). With no constitutional, statutory or public policy mandate prohibiting its acceptance (see, id.), we can find no error despite the fact that the underlying claim had not fully matured.\nDefendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not implicate the voluntariness of his plea and, as such, is similarly foreclosed by the articulated guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Coleman, 281 AD2d 653; People v Johnson, 267 AD2d 609). We note that had we reached the merits of either of these claims, we would have found no error (cf., Matter of Seda v Sise, 231 AD2d 36; see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).\nMercure, J. P., Spain, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

The court found that the defendant knowingly waived his rights to appeal and claims of double jeopardy, as his plea was made with full awareness of the relevant laws. Additionally, the court ruled that the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel did not affect the voluntariness of his plea and was also waived.<|eot_id|>"}

The record reveals that, prior to this plea, County Court had made a sentencing commitment that defendant refused to accept. Thereafter, County Court withdrew this offer. A subsequent arrangement was then entered into by which defendant would agree to plead guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first and third count of the indictment charging defendant with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. This plea was conditioned on a sentencing recommendation to County Court that defendant receive an indeterminate prison sentence that would not exceed 2 to 6 years. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea arrangement to two concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years.\nDefendant contends on appeal that County Court considered improper factors and that the sentence is harsh and excessive. The record reveals that defendant entered a knowing and voluntary guilty plea and was sentenced in accordance therewith. Defendant was given ample opportunity to reflect upon his guilty plea and the provisions of the sentence; he decided to accept all of its terms. We therefore conclude that the appeal has no merit (see, People v Masten, 215 AD2d 892, lv denied 86 NY2d 782). We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed was attributable to vindictiveness (see, People v Young, 94 NY2d 171, 177).\nMercure, J.

He thereafter was sentenced as a prior felony offender to nine years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that he was illegally sentenced as a prior felony offender due to County Court\u2019s failure to advise him of the right to challenge the allegations in the predicate felony statement, including the right to challenge the constitutional basis for the prior conviction. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, however, \u201cCounty Court was not obligated to expressly advise defendant of his right to contest the constitutionality of the prior conviction\u201d (People v Smith, 121 AD2d 771, 772 [1986] [citations omitted]; accord People v Wood, 108 AD3d 932, 932-933 [2013]). Moreover, the record reflects that, upon being questioned by County Court at sentencing, defense counsel admitted the prior conviction on defendant\u2019s behalf and informed the court that defendant did not contest the allegations in the prior felony statement. Further, when questioned directly by County Court, defendant admitted the prior conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Accordingly, we conclude that the statutory requirements of CPL 400.21 (3) were substantially complied with, and County Court properly sentenced defendant as a prior felony offender (see People v Wood, 108 AD3d at 933).\nStein, J.P, McCarthy, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court of Ulster County, where he was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced to nine years in prison as a prior felony offender.

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered February 12, 1986, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and promoting prison contraband in the first degree (two counts).\nDefendant was found guilty as charged of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. These charges arose from defendant\u2019s role in attempting to transmit a quantity of cocaine and heroin to an inmate at the Albany County Jail. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of iVi to 15 years on the possession counts, IV2 to 15 years on the attempted sale counts and 2 to 4 years on the contraband counts.\nOn this appeal, defendant first claims that County Court improperly failed to exercise its discretion by not placing its rationale for the denial of her Sandoval motion on the record. Our review of the record reveals that County Court explicitly found that defendant\u2019s prior convictions were not remote in time, would have bearing on defendant\u2019s credibility and showed a propensity to elevate defendant\u2019s own self-interest over that of society. Thus, County Court clearly exercised its discretion in an acceptable manner and defendant\u2019s claim must be rejected. Likewise without merit are defendant\u2019s contentions that County Court should have excluded her prior convictions or, at least, employed a Sandoval compromise by allowing the admission of defendant\u2019s earlier felony conviction without disclosure of the factual incidents. The prior crimes at issue were petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree and did not involve drugs in any way. Thus, these convictions were sufficiently different from the crimes charged in the instant indictment that we cannot say that County Court erred in its ruling on the Sandoval motion. In this regard, we note that County Court properly indicated that it would give an instruction that any prior conviction could only be considered for issues of credibility (see generally, People v Pavao, 59 NY2d 282, 291-292).\nWe further find no reason to invoke our authority to upset the sentence, which is within the statutory guidelines and cannot be deemed excessive, especially considering defendant\u2019s lengthy and increasingly more serious criminal record. Similarly, we decline to consider defendant\u2019s contention that County Court improperly charged that cocaine and heroin are dangerous contraband within the meaning of the Penal Law. No exceptions or requests were made by defendant concerning the charge and, therefore, this issue has not been preserved for review on appeal.\nJudgment affirmed. Main, J. P., Casey, Weiss, Mikoll and Levine, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe defendant was convicted on multiple counts related to drug possession and attempted sale, as well as promoting prison contraband, stemming from an attempt to send cocaine and heroin to an inmate.

The sentence was affirmed as it fell within statutory guidelines and was not considered excessive, with additional issues raised by the defendant not preserved for appeal.<|eot_id|>"}

In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4xh to 9 years. We reject defendant\u2019s initial claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because he was represented by three different attorneys from the Public Defender\u2019s office.

J.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Sherman, J.), rendered January 7, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of three counts of the crime of forgery in the second degree.\nDefendant was indicted on 12 counts of forgery in the second degree and 12 counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree. Claiming that he forged the checks in order to support his cocaine habit, defendant sought to plead guilty and be sentenced to parole supervision for drug treatment pursuant to CPL 410.91. The prosecutor refused to provide the required consent to that sentencing option (see CPL 410.91 [4]) and County Court denied defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of that requirement. Thereafter, pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of forgery in the second degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 170.10), in full satisfaction of the indictment, and was sentenced as a second felony offender to, inter alia, concurrent prison terms of 2 to 4 years. On appeal, defendant argues that the consent provision contained in CPL 410.91 (4) unconstitutionally violates the separation of powers doctrine by improperly delegating judicial authority to the executive branch.\nInitially, we note that this Court recently addressed the same argument, in dicta, in People v Mack (304 AD2d 847, 848 [2003]), where we observed that the defendant failed to show \u201cthat CPL 410.91 (4) violates the separation of powers doctrine and is thus unconstitutional.\u201d With that issue squarely before us herein, we reach the same conclusion. Notably, with respect to sentencing in criminal matters, there can be no dispute that \u201cthe ultimate determination of an appropriate sentence is to be made by the court\u201d (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 307 [1981]). Nevertheless, the Legislature has full authority to create criminal offenses and also \u201cto limit the sentencing options available to the judiciary [for those offenses]\u201d (People v Eason, 40 NY2d 297, 301 [1976]). Accordingly, \u201c[s]o long as a statute does not wrest from courts the final discretion to impose sentence, it does not infringe upon the constitutional division of responsibilities\u201d (id. at 301 [emphasis in original]).\nHere, while CPL 410.91 (4) limits a court\u2019s discretion to the extent of requiring the prosecutor\u2019s consent prior to the imposition of a parole supervision sentence, it does not constrain a court to sentence a defendant in any particular way. As such, defendant has failed in his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of establishing that CPL 410.91 (4) violates the separation of powers doctrine (People v Mack, supra at 848; see People v North St. Book Shoppe, 139 AD2d 118, 119 [1988], lv denied 72 NY2d 1048 [1988]).\nMercure, Crew III, Peters and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, which was conditioned upon defendant\u2019s right to pursue appellate review of his statutory speedy trial claim, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of two years followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision and executed a written waiver of appeal.\nBy pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his right to appellate review of his claim that his statutory right to a speedy trial (see CPL 30.30) was violated (see People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993 [1996]; People v O\u2019Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]). However, at the time of the plea allocution, County Court not only failed to advise defendant of this direct consequence of his plea, it specifically advised defendant that \u201cyou still retain your right to appeal the 30.30 decision.\u201d Consequently, we agree with defendant that his plea of guilty was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary. To the extent that defendant failed to properly preserve this issue, we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to reverse and vacate the plea (see People v Hill, 9 NY3d 189, 191 [2007], cert denied 553 US \u2014, 128 S Ct 2430 [2008]; People v Morbillo, 56 AD3d 694, 694-695 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 786 [2009]; cf People v Jackson, 64 AD3d 1248, 1249-1250 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 745 [2009]).\nIn light of the above, defendant\u2019s remaining contention is academic.\nPeters, J.P, Rose, Kavanagh and Garry, JJ., concur.

Following consolidation of the indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges. Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 years, with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Folk, 43 AD3d 1229, 1230 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1033 [2008]; People v Brill, 42 AD3d 823, 823 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 960 [2007]). In any event, even assuming that defendant\u2019s contention that County Court misrepresented the maximum sentence defendant was facing under the indictments at his arraignment is correct, inaccurate information concerning sentence exposure is not dispositive of whether a plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered (see People v Garcia, 92 NY2d 869, 870 [1998]). Furthermore, as our review of the record reveals no evidence that defendant relied on this information in entering his plea, we are convinced that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea (see People v Wilkinson, 151 AD2d 801, 802 [1989], lv denied 74 NY2d 821 [1989]). Finally, as both indictments are for offenses defined by the same statutory provision, we find that County Court acted within its discretion in consolidating the indictments pursuant to the People\u2019s application (see CPL 200.20 [2] [c]; [4]; People v Ferrer, 17 AD3d 777, 777 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]).\nCardona, P.J., Spain, Carpinello and Stein, JJ., concur.

On July 15, 1994, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the express understanding that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. At defendant\u2019s request, sentencing was adjourned to permit him to enter into a substance abuse program. Although sentencing was to be adjourned to honor defendant\u2019s request, it was expressly acknowledged by both defendant and his counsel that no promises were made by either the People or County Court that defendant would receive a more favorable sentence in the event he was successful in his rehabilitative endeavors (compare, People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841).\nFollowing defendant\u2019s participation in several rehabilitation programs, he came before County Court on August 25, 1995 for sentencing. At this time, defense counsel opined that defendant had made good-faith efforts to rehabilitate himself and moved to withdraw the prior guilty plea. In opposing this request, the District Attorney questioned the success actually attained by defendant in the preceding 15-month period and reminded the court that no promises were made to defendant upon his guilty plea in any event. County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 3 to 6 years.\nOn appeal, defendant requests that this Court remit the matter to County Court for the purpose of conducting a hearing to determine the accuracy of the District Attorney\u2019s statements at sentencing with respect to defendant\u2019s success in rehabilitating himself. Noting that defendant\u2019s participation in rehabilitation was not a condition imposed by County Court prior to sentencing, but rather was an accommodation for defendant\u2019s benefit agreed to by the People and permitted by the court, and in consideration of the fact that defendant knew that even the most successful rehabilitation experience did not guarantee him a more lenient sentence, we find that County Court was free to impose the agreed-upon sentence without offering defendant a chance to prove that his treatment was successful (or disprove the District Attorney\u2019s statements that it was not) or withdrawing his guilty plea. Consequently, the sentence should stand and we decline defendant\u2019s request that we remit the matter in the interest of justice.\nMikoll, J. P., Crew III, White and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, following his guilty plea and a three to six-year prison sentence. Despite the defendant's participation in rehabilitation programs, the court noted that there were no promises regarding a more lenient sentence based on his rehabilitation efforts. The appeal for a hearing on the defendant's rehabilitation success was denied, as the court determined that the original sentence was appropriately imposed.<|eot_id|>"}

P.\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered May 12, 1995, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree.\nDefendant, having been found by a jury to have supplied Richard Pierre with one pound of marihuana which Pierre, in turn, sold to an undercover police officer and his informant, was convicted of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree and sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years. We agree with defendant\u2019s that proof that Pierre previously obtained marihuana from him on three or four unspecified occasions for unspecified reasons bore no relationship to the particular crime with which he was charged and was not necessary to complete the narrative of events. Consequently, the admission of such proof constituted error. We nevertheless affirm because our review of the record convinces us that proof of defendant\u2019s complicity here was so overwhelming that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (see, People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230). Defendant\u2019s remaining contention\u2014that his sentence was harsh and excessive\u2014has been examined and found to be lacking in merit.\nWhite, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur.

Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of five years, with three years of postrelease supervision, and ordered to pay restitution. He now appeals.\nWe affirm. Defendant\u2019s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary, that the plea allocution was not factually sufficient, and that he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel were not preserved for our review, as he did not raise them in an appropriate postallocution motion and he made no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this matter within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [Apr. 20, 2015]). In any event, these claims lack merit. It was not necessary for defendant to personally recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual recitation, and his \u201cunequivocal affirmative responses to County Court\u2019s questions were sufficient to establish the elements of the crime charged\u201d (People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780, 781 [2005]). Further, the record reflects that defendant was advised of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and the related consequences, he understood them and had adequate time to confer with counsel, and he entered the guilty plea voluntarily.\nMoreover, defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims predominantly concern what counsel advised him or other matters outside the record on appeal which are more properly pursued in a motion pursuant to CPL article 440, where a record could be made (see People v Jerome, 98 AD3d 1188, 1189 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 987 [2012]). Given, among other considerations, the advantageous plea agreement negotiated by counsel that greatly reduced defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure and defendant\u2019s acknowledged satisfaction, during the plea allocution, of counsel\u2019s representation, we find that the record fails to support defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of meaningful representation (see People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 922 [2010]; People v Corbett, 52 AD3d 1023, 1024 [2008]). Finally, in view of defendant\u2019s criminal history and drug-selling activity, we are not persuaded that extraordinary circumstances are present or that there was an abuse of sentencing discretion so as to warrant a reduction of the favorable, bargained-for sentence in the interest of justice (see People v White, 47 AD3d 1062, 1064 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 818 [2008]). Inasmuch as the plea agreement included restitution in the amount ordered and defendant did not request a hearing or otherwise challenge the amount at sentencing, his challenge to the amount of restitution ordered is unpreserved for our review and we find that corrective action is not warranted in the interest of justice (see People v Brown, 122 AD3d 1006, 1007 [2014]).\nLahtinen, J.P., Garry and Clark, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.\nDefendant\u2019s codefendant, Gary Watkins, was subsequently convicted after trial of multiple counts of both criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, including three controlled buys where defendant and Watkins acted in concert, and this Court affirmed Watkins\u2019 judgment of conviction (People v Watkins, 121 AD3d 1425 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1124 [2015]).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, following his guilty plea as part of a plea agreement. The defendant's claims regarding the voluntariness of his plea, sufficiency of the plea allocution, and ineffective assistance of counsel were deemed unpreserved for review, as they were not raised appropriately and lacked merit. The court found no extraordinary circumstances to justify a reduction of the sentence or challenge the restitution amount, leading to the conclusion that the sentencing discretion was not abused.<|eot_id|>"}

In return, defendant was offered a prison sentence of 2 to 4 years, with the court making the sentence contingent on defendant\u2019s not being arrested or convicted of any crime between the plea and sentence. In the event of such a happenstance, defendant could receive a harsher sentence with the option of withdrawing his plea.\nDefendant was in fact charged with the commission of a felony before sentence. On February 20, 1992, he appeared before County Court and was offered the option of withdrawing his plea of guilty, having a hearing to determine whether he had actually committed a crime between his plea and sentencing, or proceeding with the plea agreement but with an enhanced prison sentence of 2 Vi to 5 years. Defendant, after consultation with his attorney, agreed to continue with the plea agreement and was sentenced to 2 Vi to 5 years.\nOn this appeal, defendant argues that his waiver of appeal executed on October 15, 1991 was not an effective waiver of his right to appeal the sentence rendered February 20, 1992. Defendant contends that in failing to demand of him the execution of a second waiver of appeal, there is no bar to an appeal by him of his February 20, 1992 sentence. We disagree. The record indicated that the plea and proceedings before County Court on October 15, 1991 and continued on February 20, 1992 are part of a single plea agreement. We thus hold that defendant waived his right to appeal as a condition of his plea bargain. Defendant\u2019s right to appeal is relegated only as to the question of illegality of sentence or lack of voluntariness of the plea, issues he does not raise (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY 1, 10).\nCardona, P.

Defendant successfully moved to dismiss four of the eight charges against him and, in full satisfaction of those remaining charges, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a five-year prison term with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s failure to move to either withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Cintron, 62 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 742 [2009]). The exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable as the plea colloquy did not negate an essential element of the crime and defendant\u2019s guilt was adequately established (see id.).\nTo the extent that defendant claims that ineffective assistance of counsel affected the voluntariness of his plea, which claim survives defendant\u2019s valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Crudup, 45 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2007]), that claim is unpreserved given defendant\u2019s failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]). In any event, the record reveals that defendant was provided with meaningful representation (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 853 [2009]).\nDefendant\u2019s challenges related to the search warrant do not survive his valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Anderson, 63 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 794 [2009]). Similarly, defendant\u2019s challenge to County Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion does not survive the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]). Finally, the waiver also precludes his claim that the negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Walley, 63 AD3d 1284, 1286 [2009]).\nSpain, J.P., Rose, Kavanagh and McCarthy, JJ., concur.

The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally-low term of imprisonment for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed upon sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment. On appeal, both parties agree that the conviction should be reduced to a crime of a lesser degree in order to effectuate the plea agreement.\nUnder the circumstances, the judgment should be modified, in the interests of justice, by reducing the conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489; cf., People v Monereau, 181 AD2d 918; People v Alvarez, 166 AD2d 603). We note that since the sentence imposed upon the defendant\u2019s plea was the sentence promised, no purpose would be served by remitting the matter for resentencing (see, People v Brown, supra; People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743).\nWe find that the sentence imposed was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).

This modification was made to reflect the parties' misunderstanding regarding the felony classification at the time of the plea.

Defendant\u2019s sentencing date was adjourned for this purpose and the agreement clearly stated that, in the event the program was successfully completed, he would receive a sentence of time served along with five years\u2019 probation. In the event defendant did not comply with the agreement, however, it was understood that he would be sentenced to a term of incarceration. Thereafter, defendant was discharged from the drug court program for failing to comply with the rules. Following a hearing, County Court found defendant guilty of willfully violating the terms and conditions of his sentence. The court subsequently sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 21/s to 7 years in prison. This appeal followed.\nWe affirm. Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, we conclude that the People proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his sentence (see generally, CPL 410.70 [3]; see also, People v Recor, 209 AD2d 831, 832, affd 87 NY2d 933). Notably, at the violation hearing, the People presented two witnesses, one of whom was defendant\u2019s case manager, who testified that defendant was discharged, from the program for, inter alla, violating the attendance policies for treatment meetings. Given the unambiguous terms of the participation agreement signed by defendant and his awareness of his responsibilities in that regard, we find no reason to disturb County Court\u2019s conclusion that defendant willfully violated the agreement.\nMercure, J.

At sentencing, appellant asked the court to have him examined by a doctor regarding his drug addiction. In refusing this request the sentencing court stated \u201c that there is no indication that you are an addict at this time.\u201d This was error. The court had before it a probation report containing evidence of narcotics usage by the defendant. The report also contained references to narcotics used by defendant and suggested that the crime for which defendant was charged was committed to support a narcotics habit.

P., Witmer, Moule, Cardamone and Henry, JJ.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court unanimously reversed the defendant's sentence for attempted burglary and vacated it, remanding the case to Monroe County Court for further proceedings. The original court erred by denying the defendant's request for a medical examination regarding his drug addiction, despite evidence in the probation report indicating narcotics usage and suggesting that the crime was committed to support such a habit. The defendant is entitled to a medical examination and resentencing in accordance with the Mental Hygiene Law and Penal Law provisions.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFour judgments of the County Court, Nassau County, each rendered June 22, 1967 upon defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, modified, on the law, by deferring imprisonment thereunder until termination of the sentence imposed by the District Court, Nassau County, on April 21, 1967, at which time defendant will be required to serve the sentences now under review in full, with due credit for time already served, as indicated herein. As so modified, judgments affirmed. No questions of fact were considered on this appeal. On April 21, 1967 the District Court, Nassau County, sentenced defendant to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission for misdemeanors committed after April 1, 1967, and made an order of certification. (Cf. Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7\u00a7 207, 208.) He was placed in a rehabilitation or treatment center and was thereafter brought to the County Court, Nassau County, where on May 11, 1967 he withdrew his pleas of not guilty to four 1966 indictments and pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a narcotic drug as a felony under one of the indictments and to petit larceny under each of the other three indictments. On June 22, 1967 he appeared for sentence and objected to the imposition thereof on the ground that it would improperly interrupt his sentence to the custody of the Commission and would frustrate the rehabilitation program set up by the Mental Hygiene Law. The court imposed the sentences now under review, namely, a term of 1% to 5 years for the felony and a term of one year for each petit larceny. All sentences were concurrent, and execution of the misdemeanor sentences was suspended, defendant being placed on probation for three years. He is presently incarcerated under the sentence for the felony. In a criminal action the sentence is the judgment of conviction (People V. Cioffi, 1 N Y 2d 70, 72). Here defendant\u2019s certification to the care and custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission was made in a criminal action and is deemed a judgment of conviction (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208, subd. 5). The period of his commitment commenced on April 21, 1967, when the order of certification was made (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208, subd. 4, par. a). Escape from a rehabilitation center is a misdemeanor (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 211, subd. 2), and defendant\u2019s confinement therein is clearly imprisonment. No court or Judge has authority to interrupt a prisoner\u2019s sentence after imprisonment thereunder has commenced (People ex rel. Rainone v. Murphy, 1 N Y 2d 367, 373). We find no fault with the sentences as imposed by the County Court; we do find that defendant\u2019s immediate incarceration under the felony sentence was without authority in law, and hence the District Court sentence continued to run despite his incarceration under the County Court sentence. True, the commission has authority to discharge a defendant as rehabilitated prior to expiration of the three-year period (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 208, subd. 4, par. a), but so far as the record discloses that was not done here. The commission does not have the power, by its own gratuitous act of delivering defendant to the County authorities for the service of a sentence imposed by the County Court, to interrupt the running of the District Court sentence (cf. People ex rel. Kenny v. Jackson, 4 N Y 2d 229, 233). Moreover, defendant\u2019s incarceration under the felony sentence frustrates the rehabilitation program established by the statute (see Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 200). Accordingly, defendant should be transferred from his present place of incarceration to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission to serve the balance of the sentence imposed by the District Court on April 21, 1967, with due credit for all time served outside the custody of the commission from that date to the date of transfer, and upon termination of the District Court sentence defendant should be returned to State Prison to serve in full the sentence imposed by the County Court on June 22, 1967, with credit for the time already served thereunder up to the date of his return to the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission for the completion of his sentence under the prior conviction (cf. People ex rel. Rainone v. Murphy, 1 N Y 2d 367, 374, supra). Beldock, P. J., Rabin, Benjamin, Munder and Martuscello, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe judgments from the County Court in Nassau County, rendered on June 22, 1967, were modified to defer the defendant's imprisonment until the completion of a prior sentence imposed by the District Court on April 21, 1967, for narcotics offenses. The defendant's immediate incarceration under the County Court's felony sentence was deemed unauthorized, and he will serve the current County Court sentences only after completing the District Court commitment, with credit for time served. The court affirmed the modified judgments, emphasizing that the defendant's rehabilitation program must not be interrupted.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County, rendered August 13, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and one count of possession of weapons, dangerous instruments and appliances. Following a jury trial, defendant George A. Skokan, Jr., was convicted of the possession of cocaine and marijuana as well as brass knuckles. Thereafter, he was sentenced to a term of not less than five years nor more than 15 years on the cocaine conviction and to a concurrent term not exceeding five years on the marijuana conviction. For possession of the brass knuckles he received a one-year term in the county jail. On this appeal, defendant raises two questions relating to the admission of certain testimony into evidence and the issuance of a search warrant, which were previously considered by this court in an appeal by his wife who was a codefendant, and we see no reason for further discussion or disturbance of our earlier resolution of those issues (People v Skokan, 50 AD2d 615). His only remaining contention is that the sentence which he received is excessive, but we must disagree as the sentencing court has broad discretion in this area and no extraordinary circumstances are presented justifying our interference therewith (People v Dittmar, 41 AD2d 788; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861). Although the sentence imposed for the possession of cocaine, a class C felony, was the maximum permissible (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 2, par [c]), the court adequately explained its action and its reasons for imposing a minimum term as well (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.00, subd 3, par [b]) and in view of the serious nature of the crime and defendant\u2019s admitted prior involvement in drug traffic there was no abuse of discretion. Likewise, the other sentences are clearly within the statutory limits and should not be disturbed. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P. J., Greenblott, Main, Larkin and Reynolds, JJ., concur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe County Court of Schenectady County convicted George A. Skokan, Jr. of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine and marijuana) and possession of brass knuckles, resulting in a sentence of 5 to 15 years for the cocaine conviction and a concurrent 5-year term for marijuana, along with a 1-year jail term for the brass knuckles. On appeal, Skokan challenged the admission of evidence and the search warrant but was denied further discussion on these issues, and his claim of excessive sentencing was rejected as the court acted within its discretion and justified the maximum sentence for the serious nature of the crimes. The judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize the legal cases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nSpain, J.\nAppeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered November 23, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered January 30, 2007, which denied defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction.\nUpon the execution of a search warrant at an apartment located in the City of Albany, defendant was found in possession of heroin. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he later pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. His posttrial motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and the order denying his motion to vacate.\nWith regard to defendant\u2019s claims on his direct appeal, we cannot agree with the People\u2019s contention that defendant effectively waived his right to appeal. The record of the plea colloquy does not adequately reflect, as the Court of Appeals has indicated it must in a decision subsequent to this plea, that \u201cdefendant understood that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty\u201d (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]) or that his oral appeal waiver was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]; see also People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]).\nHowever, we find\u2014contrary to defendant\u2019s contentions\u2014that his plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]). The plea minutes reflect that defendant was advised of\u2014and indicated he understood\u2014the trial-related rights he would be foregoing by entering a guilty plea, and of the consequences of so doing; he indicated he had a full chance to discuss the proof with his attorney, that his plea was a voluntary choice, and that he was entering a plea because he was in fact guilty. Defendant then answered in the affirmative when asked if he was in possession of more than a one-half ounce of heroin on the date, time and location as alleged in the indictment (which were recited at the plea), and he entered a valid guilty plea. Defendant made no statements which cast doubt on his guilt or his understanding of the plea, or were inconsistent with guilt or negated an element of the crime so as to trigger County Court\u2019s duty to question him further (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]). It was not required that defendant himself recite the elements of the crime or to engage in a recitation of the underlying facts (see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780, 781 [2005]; People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 972 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]).\nUpon consideration of the mitigating factors urged by defendant, we are not persuaded that the agreed-upon eight-year sentence\u2014which represents a midrange second felony offender sentence for this class B drug felony (see Penal Law \u00a7 70.70 [3] [b] [i] [3Va to 12-year range])\u2014is harsh or excessive. Finding no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances, we decline to reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]).\nDefendant further argues that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel based upon counsel\u2019s alleged deficient conduct related to his suppression motions and misadvice concerning his right to appeal following his guilty plea. Defendant also argues that his pro se motion to vacate on those grounds was improperly denied without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [1] [h]; 440.30). We find, however, that County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing, which was supported only by his affidavit reciting the chronology of his case, given the absence of any \u201csworn allegations\u201d (CPL 440.30 [4] [b]) substantiating his allegations that suppression was warranted or that defense counsel provided inadequate representation, allegations which were otherwise unsupported (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]; see also People v Woodard, 23 AD3d 771 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 782 [2006]). Also, upon review of the record as a whole, we do not find that defendant was deprived of meaningful representation by trial counsel (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]). Defendant\u2019s remaining claims lack merit.\nCrew III, J.P., Carpinello, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment and order are affirmed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe court affirmed the defendant's conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance and the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment. The defendant had pleaded guilty to possessing heroin and received an agreed-upon eight-year sentence. The court found that the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, and that the denial of his motion for ineffective assistance of counsel was appropriate as his claims lacked sufficient evidence.<|eot_id|>"}
