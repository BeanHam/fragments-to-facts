What was the name of the surgery, again?\nDoctor: It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today? \nPatient: Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain. \nDoctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?\nPatient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicines? \nPatient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \nDoctor: Did that do anything?\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \nDoctor: How did this work? \nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.<|eot_id|>"}

We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.

She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.

I see he has previously had an operation on the right knee, can you tell me more about that? \nGuest_family: He previously had a lot of trouble straightening out both of his legs, and since the right was worse than the left he had an operation on the inside part of the back of that leg. \nDoctor: When was this operation? \nGuest_family: It was in February of two thousand seven. \nDoctor: How did he respond to the operation? \nGuest_family: He responded really well, he was walking much better, and even got back to playing sports with the other kids in the neighborhood. \nDoctor: What seems to be the problem today? \nGuest_family: Now, his left knee is getting really bad, it's like how the right knee was. He can't straighten this leg. I think we should do the same operation again on the left knee. \nDoctor: Yes, I think we'll have to do surgery. \nGuest_family: What is the risk of infection with the surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's been less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics in order to minimize infection risk. \nGuest_family: Will he be under anesthesia for the procedure?\nDoctor: Yes, he will be. He won't feel anything. \nGuest_family: Will this completely solve his problem?\nDoctor: I can't guarantee that he won't need additional procedures in the future.

The patient presents now with worsening left knee flexion contracture, and desires the same procedure to be performed.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.

What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. \nDoctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? \nPatient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. \nDoctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? \nPatient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. \nDoctor: Is anything else going on? \nPatient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. \nDoctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? \nPatient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. \nDoctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? \nPatient: Not that I remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face.  She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week.  These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair.  This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.  Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television.  She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.  She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours.  Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.  She thinks she may snore, but she is not sure.  She does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath.<|eot_id|>"}

I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh.  I have been having trouble with my right hand. It is like I am clumsy on my right side. I ended up falling because my right hand missed the railing when I grabbed it to head up the stairs. \nDoctor: Are you left or right handed? \nPatient: Right. \nDoctor: Can you tell me a little bit more about the trouble that you are having with the right hand?

She did both. She said she would send my records over. \nDoctor: Oh. I see it here! Did Doctor Madison discuss the results of your H C T and the M R I yet? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Okay. The results showed clinoid masses. This explains that problems that you have been having with your right side, your balancing problems, and the visual disturbances. With only the M R I I cannot tell if the masses are malignant or not. \nPatient: So, are the masses cancer? \nDoctor: I don't know yet.

My allergies are also acting up again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \nDoctor: Let me take a look.

Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine.\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Has your urine been checked since then? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.\nPatient: I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work.\nDoctor: Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas.

Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.

Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. \nDoctor: What's been the problem with her feet?\nGuest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. \nDoctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?\nGuest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. \nDoctor: Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. \nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?\nPatient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. \nGuest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. \nGuest_family: What does that procedure entail? \nDoctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. \nGuest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? \nDoctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.\nGuest_family: How is this possible, doctor?\nDoctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \nGuest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.<|eot_id|>"}

What medical conditions do you have? \nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}

Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}

I have treated her with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion, and wash her hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.  She comes in today for reevaluation because she is flaring.  Her hands are very dry, they are cracked, she has been washing with soap.  She states that the Cetaphil cleansing lotion apparently is causing some burning and pain because of the fissures in her skin.  She has been wearing some gloves also apparently.  The patient is single.  She is unemployed.<|eot_id|>"}
