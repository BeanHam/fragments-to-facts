Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.

Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.</s>"}

I see you're being seen for an evaluation for your allergy. Can you please confirm your age?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Thirty four.\nDoctor: Let me take a look at your medical records. I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct? \nPatient: Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up. \nDoctor: Who told you to have a follow up? \nPatient: One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor. \nDoctor: I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day. \nPatient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that? \nDoctor: Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell? \nPatient: Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me.  \nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \nDoctor: I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that either. \nDoctor: That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure? \nPatient: Yeah, I do. \nDoctor: I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well. [/INST] A 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.</s>"}

The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.

I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing.

She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.

Did he give you any medications?\nPatient: Yes, he gave me some opioids. \nDoctor: Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now? \nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \nDoctor: Did you have this done? \nPatient: Yes, I did. \nDoctor: Did this help at all? \nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news.

The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.</s>"}

Next, which hand do you write with? \nPatient: I write with my right hand. \nDoctor: Finally, what do you do for a living? \nPatient: I'm an aircraft mechanic. \nDoctor: Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?\nPatient: Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands.\nDoctor: How big was the gap that you stepped in?\nPatient: Um, it was about a foot and a half. \nDoctor: Which knee did you hurt?\nPatient: It was my left knee.\nDoctor: Did you have surgery after the accident?\nPatient: Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those. \nDoctor: Okay, yes, I see.\nPatient: Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y.\nDoctor: Do you have any imaging of this knee? \nPatient: I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Can I see that report?\nPatient: Yes absolutely, here. \nDoctor: Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment. \nPatient: Oh, thank you, that's good. \nDoctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. \nDoctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?\nPatient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.\nDoctor: Are you having any back pain? \nPatient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.\nDoctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? \nPatient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. \nDoctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?\nPatient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.\nDoctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?\nPatient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.\nDoctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?\nPatient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. \nDoctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \nDoctor: Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities. That's good. [/INST] Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic.  On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.</s>"}

I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct. [/INST] This is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.</s>"}

He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.</s>"}

We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \nDoctor: Was she slurring?\nGuest_family: Nope. \nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \nDoctor: How was it after that? \nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her. [/INST] This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.</s>"}
