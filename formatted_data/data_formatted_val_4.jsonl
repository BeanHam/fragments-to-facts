Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks.

The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.

I'm just feeling lightheaded.\nDoctor: Is it happening after anything special you are doing? What symptoms are you witnessing?\nPatient:  Whenever I'm trying to change my positions like standing from sitting or getting up from the bed it is happening. Normally sitting back down helps. But it is not completely gone for like fifteen to thirty minutes. I feel very shaky and weak.\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications for that?\nPatient: Ah yes, I was taking lorazepam, but it did not help with the sensation.\nDoctor: Anything else going on?\nPatient: Um, my blood pressure was up so they increased my dose of metoprolol for it.

I just wanted to check in with you as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance.  He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.  He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.  It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.  It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.<|eot_id|>"}

So, this is an African American gentleman who has stage four C K D secondary to P K D. He's had a high creatinine level over the last six months, so we've been following him closely. \nPatient: Yes, that's all correct, doctor. \nDoctor: Have you been going to the end stage kidney disease classes? \nPatient: No, I haven't been able to get in yet. \nDoctor: We've talked about how important it is for you to take your blood pressure medication, have you been doing that? \nPatient: Yes, and look at the reading from today. \nDoctor: Yes, this is much better. Good job! Have you gone to the transplant orientation classes?\nPatient: No, not yet.\nDoctor: How about dialysis education classes? \nPatient: No, I haven't been to those either. \nDoctor: Sir, we've talked about this, it's important for you to get into these classes. \nPatient: I know, doctor. \nDoctor: Okay, well, we need to follow up his P S A today, it's been about two years since the last time. \nPatient: Why do you need that?\nDoctor: Well, we'll most likely need cardiac clearance if we're ever able to see if you can get a transplant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a followup for this 69-year-old African American gentleman with stage IV chronic kidney disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease.

I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.<|eot_id|>"}

How are you doing today? \nPatient: I hurt my left wrist again. \nDoctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?\nPatient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. \nDoctor: I see. How did you hurt it? \nPatient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. \nDoctor: Did it hurt before that? \nPatient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. \nDoctor: The recent injury made it worse?\nPatient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. \nDoctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? \nPatient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. \nDoctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. \nPatient: My scapho- what? \nDoctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist.  However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.  He is here now for evaluation.<|eot_id|>"}

Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. \nDoctor: What's been the problem with her feet?\nGuest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. \nDoctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?\nGuest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. \nDoctor: Yes, I see.

Will she be asleep for this procedure? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Thank you. \nDoctor: So, you just celebrated your birthday. How was it? How is it feeling to be close to forties? \nPatient: I just turned thirty nine. I would say older the wiser. \nDoctor: That's true. Okay, so you are here for your follow up. Let's see, you have type one diabetes mellitus, right?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Last time I was here almost four months ago. \nDoctor: How are you doing since last visit? \nPatient: I have been good. My sugar has been under the range. Unfortunately, my pump was having some issues for the last two weeks. \nDoctor: Oh no. What happened? \nPatient: I don't know. I tried to get it fixed but nothing worked out, so I had to buy a new one and then being old kind of hit me. You know, I was not able to set it up. I was stuck on the pump settings and was having a lot of difficulties. With all this going on, I was not able to control my sugar over past two weeks and there might have been like some ups and downs in my levels which I could not notice or register. \nDoctor: During this, did you notice anything like, did you lose your consciousness? Did you faint? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: How about sweating, tired, or lightheadedness and or change in vision? Or any kind of confusion in mind? \nPatient: Nope, nothing like that. \nDoctor: That's good, so there hasn't been any hypoglycemic event. I mean, your sugar didn't drop down. \nPatient: Oh yeah, I didn't think so. \nDoctor: Okay, let's see how about hyperglycemia? Did you think your sugar levels went high? \nPatient: I think, there was some difficulties with both the fasting and after meals, but I'm not sure. \nDoctor: Are you urinating more than normal? \nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Are you eating more than normal or drinking more than normal? Are you feeling thirsty or not? \nPatient: Not that I noticed. \nDoctor: Are you exercising? \nPatient: Oh, I tried but didn't work out so not exercising at this point, but I follow a fixed diet. But you know, being a mother is in itself full of physical activities. I mean, I have twins and also a young baby who keep me busy. \nDoctor: Are you working? \nPatient: Yes, I'm working as a medical coder. It is a full time job and you just keep busy. Sometimes I don't even realize that I missed my meal, but I do keep some snacks with me I'm just eating while completing my work. It might not be the best case scenario, but I don't get any time for any kind of physical activities. \nDoctor: Are you visiting your physician regularly? \nPatient: Of course. I'm very regular. I keep a track of my annual visits. My annual examinations. I take my dental visits after every six months, and I recently had my eye examination done. All was good. \nPatient: This reminded me that we did a lab last time I came. How did it go? \nDoctor: Oh yes, thank you for reminding me. Let's see how your numbers are.

The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

We tried to shake her but during that period she just does not respond.\nDoctor: Does she becomes floppy like can't control her body during that phase? \nGuest_family: No, we didn't notice that. \nDoctor: How long is that period? \nGuest_family2: I think it lasts somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. \nDoctor: What are your thoughts on this? As a mother you might be spending more time with her. \nGuest_family: Yeah, I have noticed this too, but I think it stays for like three to four minutes. \nDoctor: So, it is somewhere around thirty to forty seconds.\nGuest_family: One day I was outside the store and then I noticed that she had a similar event. Her skin around her mouth turned blue. \nDoctor: Was she having any kind of jerky motions?\nGuest_family: No. \nDoctor: Have you changed her medications like the amount you are giving or anything like that? \nGuest_family: No, we haven't changed anything. She's still on the same dose. \nDoctor: I'm looking at the record and it says that she is supposed to take twenty M G per kilogram every day. It looks like a very low dose for her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.<|eot_id|>"}

It is nice to meet you. \nDoctor: What brings you into see me today? \nPatient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.\nDoctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?\nPatient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. \nDoctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? \nPatient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.\nDoctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. \nDoctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? \nPatient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  \nDoctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? \nPatient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. \nDoctor: How long has that been going on? \nPatient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  \nDoctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? \nPatient: No. I don't think so. \nDoctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? \nPatient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. \nDoctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.\nPatient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. \nDoctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? \nPatient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  \nDoctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? \nPatient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.\nDoctor: What medications are those? \nPatient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. \nDoctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? \nPatient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? \nPatient: Yes, he did. \nDoctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? \nPatient: Yes, I just started Zetia.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can you remind me how old you are?\nPatient: I am fifty-five.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.<|eot_id|>"}

He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.<|eot_id|>"}
