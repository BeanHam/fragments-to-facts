Thank you. \nDoctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? \nPatient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. \nDoctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?\nPatient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.\nDoctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? \nPatient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. \nDoctor: How long do the episodes last? \nPatient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. \nDoctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? \nPatient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. \nDoctor: What eyelid was drooping? \nPatient: I don't remember? \nDoctor: What is your dominate hand? \nPatient: I am right handed. \nDoctor: And how old are you? \nPatient: I am sixty seven. \nDoctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?\nPatient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.\nDoctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? \nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.<|eot_id|>"}

Next, which hand do you write with? \nPatient: I write with my right hand. \nDoctor: Finally, what do you do for a living? \nPatient: I'm an aircraft mechanic. \nDoctor: Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?\nPatient: Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands.\nDoctor: How big was the gap that you stepped in?\nPatient: Um, it was about a foot and a half. \nDoctor: Which knee did you hurt?\nPatient: It was my left knee.\nDoctor: Did you have surgery after the accident?\nPatient: Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those. \nDoctor: Okay, yes, I see.\nPatient: Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y.\nDoctor: Do you have any imaging of this knee? \nPatient: I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D. \nDoctor: Can I see that report?\nPatient: Yes absolutely, here. \nDoctor: Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment. \nPatient: Oh, thank you, that's good. \nDoctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. \nDoctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?\nPatient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.\nDoctor: Are you having any back pain? \nPatient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.\nDoctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? \nPatient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. \nDoctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?\nPatient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.\nDoctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?\nPatient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.\nDoctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?\nPatient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. \nDoctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \nDoctor: Thanks. I see.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|eot_id|>"}

The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you? \nPatient: He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery.\nDoctor: Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested? \nPatient: Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that. \nDoctor: I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?    \nPatient: Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to. \nDoctor: Besides the pain medication, have you had anything else? \nPatient: I've taken antibiotic steroids before. \nDoctor: Okay.

He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip.  He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated.  He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy.  He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking.  He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain.  He has had difficulties on and off ever since then.  On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head.  He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.  He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip.<|eot_id|>"}

Did you take any medication for that? \nPatient: I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right? \nPatient: Yeah, that's right. \nDoctor: How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics? \nPatient: Terrible.

That was one hundred thirty six. I'm just as frustrated as you are, doctor. \nDoctor: Well, if this plateau continues, we should discontinue the phentermine. \nPatient: Why is that? \nDoctor: It shouldn't be used to maintain your weight, but only to get the weight down. So, if it's not serving that purpose, we shouldn't use it. There's no real benefit there. \nPatient: Okay, yes, I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nShe is here for a followup on her weight loss on phentermine.

We agree that if she continues to plateau she really should not stay on phentermine.  We would not want her to take it to maintain her weight but only to help her get her weight down, and she may have really lost any benefit from it, and she agrees. c<|eot_id|>"}

Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.\nDoctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?\nPatient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom.

Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}

So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. \nGuest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? \nDoctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.\nGuest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? \nDoctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything.

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.

From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\nPatient: I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise. \nDoctor: I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling.

Nothing seems to help me to get rid of this discomfort.\nDoctor: How often do you check your sugar levels? \nPatient: I do it at home. Mainly two to three times a day. I increase or decrease the amount of insulin that I take based on my numbers.\nDoctor: Don't you consult anyone before doing that? \nPatient: It's been so many years now. I do it all by myself. \nDoctor: We did reevaluations of your symptoms. It turned out to be all negative. Do you smoke? \nPatient: I used to chew tobacco a lot and then there were drinks. I used to drink at least half a bottle of single malt in one night. I quit everything five years ago after my stroke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 70-year-old male who has no particular complaints other than he has just discomfort on his right side.  We have done EMG studies.  He has noticed it since his stroke about five years ago.  He has been to see a neurologist.  We have tried different medications and it just does not seem to help.  He checks his blood sugars at home two to three times a day.  He kind of adjusts his own insulin himself.  Re-evaluation of symptoms is essentially negative.  He has a past history of heavy tobacco and alcohol usage.<|eot_id|>"}

Is there any injury? \nPatient: Yes, I had a fall in the beginning of two thousand six. I slipped on a freshly waxed floor. \nDoctor: What part of your lower back did you fall onto? \nPatient: I fell onto my tailbone and just general lower back. \nDoctor: Is this the only fall you've had?\nPatient: No, I had another one in March of two thousand six. \nDoctor: What happened when you fell that time? \nPatient: I was trying to qualify on the gun range with a handgun, when I lost my footing. \nDoctor: What made you lose your footing?\nPatient: I think it was more weakness than a loss of balance. \nDoctor: What treatments have you had for this?\nPatient: Well, I've been to P T, and I had, um, cauterization of some of the nerves in my lower back.\nDoctor: How many times have you had this cauterization done? \nPatient: I've had it twice, once in October and the other in November. \nDoctor: This was in two thousand eight, right? \nPatient: Correct.

The patient states that this occurred in October 2008 as well as November 2008.  The patient has a history of low back pain, secondary to a fall that originally occurred in 2006.  The patient states that she slipped on a newly waxed floor and fell on her tailbone and low back region.  The patient then had her second fall in March 2006.  The patient states that she was qualifying on the range with a handgun and lost her footing and states that she fell more due to weakness in her lower extremities rather than loss of balance.<|eot_id|>"}

What medical conditions do you have? \nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).<|eot_id|>"}
