I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.\nPatient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.\nDoctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?\nPatient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. \nDoctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?\nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?\nPatient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. \nDoctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?\nPatient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.\nDoctor: When did you switch?\nPatient: Within the last ten years or so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement?\nPatient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. \nDoctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?\nPatient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.\nDoctor: Do you have any voice tremors?\nPatient: I do.\nDoctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?\nPatient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.\nDoctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?\nPatient: Two thousand one.\nDoctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?\nPatient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.<|eot_id|>"}

Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.<|eot_id|>"}

My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. \nDoctor: How would you describe your headaches? \nPatient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. \nDoctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? \nPatient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.\nDoctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? \nPatient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. \nGuest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.\nDoctor: How about your weight? \nPatient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. \nGuest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.\nDoctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month? \nPatient: It has been bad. I don't feel like eating anymore. Looks like I have lost my appetite.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#. His appetite has been especially poor in the past month.<|eot_id|>"}

What was the name of the surgery, again?\nDoctor: It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today? \nPatient: Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain. \nDoctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?\nPatient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicines? \nPatient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \nDoctor: Did that do anything?\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \nDoctor: How did this work? \nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.<|eot_id|>"}

I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct? \nPatient: Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up. \nDoctor: Who told you to have a follow up? \nPatient: One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor. \nDoctor: I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day. \nPatient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that? \nDoctor: Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell? \nPatient: Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me.  \nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \nDoctor: I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that either. \nDoctor: That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure? \nPatient: Yeah, I do. \nDoctor: I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.<|eot_id|>"}

Just some spots here and there. \nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \nDoctor: That's good.

Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that.

Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.

Is that correct? \nPatient: Yes sir. \nDoctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now. \nDoctor: Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop. \nDoctor: Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?\nGuest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven. \nDoctor: Good, so how have you been treated for this so far? \nPatient: We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. \nGuest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. \nDoctor: Have they taken x rays yet?\nPatient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. \nDoctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. \nPatient: What, where? Can you show me?\nDoctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. \nGuest_family: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. \nGuest_family: Yes, his father agrees. We're going to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. \nDoctor: Any history of surgery? \nPatient: I have a pacemaker. \nDoctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? \nPatient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms now? \nPatient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. \nDoctor: Is that your main concern? \nPatient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. \nPatient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. \nPatient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. \nDoctor: Has it been for some time? \nPatient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. \nDoctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any neck pain? \nPatient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. \nDoctor: Have you used anything for your pain? \nPatient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little. It does give me sometimes around three hours of relief. Gabapentin did not work at all. \nDoctor: How is your sleep?\nPatient: I cannot sleep properly because of the pain. It has been for many years. I haven't had a proper sleep. \nDoctor: When did you get your pacemaker? \nPatient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. \nDoctor: Do you have any back pain?\nPatient: Nope. \nDoctor: Any change in bathroom routine? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? \nPatient: No, nothing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

I have a workers comp claim open.\nDoctor: Your pain came back while working there, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: Do you remember when your last appointment here was? \nPatient: Um, yes, it was on April twelfth two thousand five. \nDoctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit? \nPatient: Um, I'd say it was an eight out of ten. \nDoctor: Have you taken any medicine for this? \nPatient: Um, I had a Medrol Dosepak prescribed at my last visit. \nDoctor: How did your pain respond to the Dosepak? \nPatient: It took it down to about a four or five out of ten. \nDoctor: Can you point to me where the pain is, sir? \nPatient: Yes, it's right here. \nDoctor: This band right here? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the spot. \nDoctor: Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum. How would you describe your right leg pain?\nPatient: I'd say it's intermittent and minimal now, it's not always there. \nDoctor: Have you ever had back surgery? \nPatient: Um, yes, I've had two laminectomies, one in nineteen ninety and the other was in ninety four. Wait, I also had a discectomy some time in between. \nDoctor: Do you know where the focus was?\nPatient: It was at L four L 5. \nDoctor: Have you had any imaging done on the lower back? \nPatient: Yes, I had an M R I on October eighteenth two thousand four. I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows multi level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L two L three, L three L four, and L five S1, with no neural impingement, which is good. \nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \nDoctor: In summary, you have a significant amount of arthritis in the back. \nPatient: Oh yeah, I had an M R myelogram as well, here's the report. \nDoctor: Okay, this shows severe spinal stenosis at L three L four, but it may have been artifact. \nPatient: What does that mean? \nDoctor: This finding may be a misinterpretation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain.  He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994.  I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim.  Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.<|eot_id|>"}

I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours. \nDoctor: Do you take the papaverine when you feel it? \nPatient: I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.  \nDoctor: I see.

I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}

Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? \nPatient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. \nDoctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? \nPatient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. \nDoctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? \nPatient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. \nDoctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. \nPatient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. \nDoctor: Are you having feelings of depression? \nPatient: Yes, I have depression. \nDoctor: Are you being treated for your depression? \nPatient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. \nDoctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? \nPatient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. \nDoctor: How is your appetite? \nPatient: Appetite? \nDoctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? \nPatient: No problem there. \nDoctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?\nPatient: Psychotherapist?\nDoctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? \nPatient: No nothing like that.\nDoctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? \n Patient: Um they did a test. \nDoctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? \nPatient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. \nDoctor: John Hopkins? \nPatient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  \nDoctor: What were the results of the test that they did?\nPatient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.\nDoctor: He said that specifically? \nPatient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.\nDoctor: How long ago was that?\nPatient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. \nDoctor: Hum? \nPatient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.\nDoctor: What is his name?\nPatient: Whose name?\nDoctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?\nPatient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.\nDoctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?\nPatient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.\nDoctor: Okey<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm coming around between a month or two. \nDoctor: Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks. \nPatient: I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know. \nDoctor: Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant? \nPatient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. \nDoctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? \nDoctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency.

He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.<|eot_id|>"}

He is continuously complaining of pain in his belly and back. He is active otherwise. \nDoctor: Did you notice any change in his toilet habits or routine?\nGuest_family: No.\nDoctor: Any fever or chills or any other issue?\nGuest_family: No, we did not notice any such issues, he has been active and was acting very normal otherwise.\nDoctor: Any change in his eating habits?\nGuest_family: No, he has been eating and drinking as usual. He was acting normally but we did notice a foul odor coming from his nose. He was on antibiotics after removal of that piece of cotton from his right side of nose in our previous visit here. \nDoctor: How is his nose now?\nGuest_family: He got better but now we can notice that odor from his nose again.\nGuest_family: His mother started him on the antibiotics again, whatever was remaining, we think something is still there. \nDoctor: Okay, Is there anything else like runny nose or any pain in his ear or bad throat? How about cough or congestion? Or any other issues you have noticed?\nGuest_family: No, nothing of those instead he has been active and eating and drinking normally, no other issue. \nDoctor: Is he complaining of any pain or discomfort on bowel movements? Is there any increase in the frequency of urination?\nGuest_family: Well, we can't say it for sure as he still wears diapers but we have not noticed anything abnormal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.<|eot_id|>"}

It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection. \nDoctor: Okay, let me check my records. It looks like he gave you eighty milligrams of depomedrol. How was it last time after the injection? \nPatient: It worked fine.

Her 14-day average is 191.

I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten.

The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.<|eot_id|>"}

Can you remind me what operation I had? \nDoctor: Um, we did a left upper lobectomy for your stage I A non small cell lung cancer. \nPatient: Thank you, doctor. \nDoctor: Absolutely, do you have the results of your pelvic C T? \nPatient: Yes, I have the report right here. \nDoctor: Thank you, so this shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney. \nPatient: What can we do about this? \nDoctor: Well, that's why we did the barium swallow, which showed a small hiatal hernia with minimal reflux. \nPatient: Oh, yeah, I remember that. \nDoctor: So, I have your x rays from November twenty third two thousand nine here, we did an A P and lateral view, and they're normal. \nPatient: Oh, well that's good too.  \nDoctor: Are you having any pain with swallowing food? \nPatient: Yes, I get some chest pain, but I'd say it's pretty mild.

She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.  Review of systems, the patient continues to have periodic odynophagia and mid thoracic dysphagia.  This most likely is secondary to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying.  She has also had increased size of the left calf without tenderness, which has not resolved over the past several months.  She has had a previous DVT in 1975 and 1985.  She denies weight loss, anorexia, fevers, chills, headaches, new aches or pains, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath at rest, or dyspnea on exertion.<|eot_id|>"}

He also has a history of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.  He had been having increased urination and thirst.  He was seen in the hospital by the endocrinology staff and treated with insulin while hospitalized and getting treatment for his perirectal abscess.  The endocrine team apparently felt that insulin might be best for this patient, but because of financial issues, elected to place him on Glucophage and glyburide.  The patient reports that he has been taking the medication.  He is in general feeling better.  He says that his gluteal abscess is improving and he will be following up with Surgery today.<|eot_id|>"}

After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.

By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.

The patient reports some worsening of the symptoms especially involving at the dorsum of the left hand, and she points to the area that actually involves the dorsal aspect of the second, third, and fourth digits.  The patient recently has developed what sounds like an upper respiratory problem with a nonproductive cough for 3 days, although she reports that she has had subjective fevers for the past 3 or 4 days, but has not actually taken the temperature.  She has not had any night sweats or chills.  She has had no recent problems with chest pain, chest discomfort, shortness of breath or problems with GU or GI complaints.  She is returning today for routine followup evaluation.<|eot_id|>"}

No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\nPatient: Yeah. I also had shingles.\nDoctor: Are you currently living at home?\nPatient: I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. \nPatient: On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks.\nDoctor: Is it all of your fingers or only some?\nPatient: All.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?\nPatient: Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.\nDoctor: I see.\nPatient: I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.\nDoctor: Fasciculations?\nPatient: Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.\nDoctor: Any cramping or problems swallowing?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing?\nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Any constipation or diarrhea?\nPatient: Both actually. It tends to alternate.\nDoctor: But no loss of bowel or bladder control?\nPatient: No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand. \nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.\nDoctor: How long has that been going on?\nPatient: Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.<|eot_id|>"}

Patient: Sure. \nDoctor: So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months. \nPatient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results. \nDoctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like? \nPatient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed? \nPatient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night.

Sometimes I also have this dull headache. \nDoctor: Do you snore? \nPatient: I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep. \nDoctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep? \nPatient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night. \nDoctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore? \nPatient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.\nDoctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime? \nPatient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours. \nDoctor: Do you smoke? \nPatient: Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner. \nDoctor: Have you noticed any change in your weight? \nPatient: My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago. \nDoctor: If that was your maximum how is your weight now? \nPatient: Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds. \nDoctor: So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel. \nPatient: That sounds right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient presented initially to the Pulmonary Clinic with dyspnea on minimal exertion.

She also complained of nocturnal choking episodes that have since abated over the past several months.  In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results. The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks. During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours. The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner. She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.  Since that time, her weight is down by approximately 30 pounds.

They do not notice a lot of snoring at night though, but she seems to be always like that.  2.  On her right great toe, she has got some redness and erythema.

This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?\nPatient: Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often.\nDoctor: Oh boy, that's a lot going on!\nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?\nPatient: No, it's fine.\nDoctor: And are you taking anything for constipation? \nPatient: Well, just prune juice.\nDoctor: Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help.

That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. \nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: And no side effects, right?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. \nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?\nPatient: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOverall, the patient has been doing reasonably well.  She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her.  There has been a note that she is constipated. Her blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188.  I see a couple in the 150s.  However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year. She is not having problems with breathing.  No neurologic complaints or troubles.  Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.<|eot_id|>"}

Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \nDoctor: Okay. \nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \nDoctor: Was she slurring?\nGuest_family: Nope. \nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \nDoctor: How was it after that? \nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.<|eot_id|>"}

The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.

It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \nDoctor: Okay. \nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \nDoctor: Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life? \nPatient: No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain.  He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.<|eot_id|>"}

So, you are here for your follow up today. \nPatient: Yes, sir. \nDoctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? \nPatient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. \nDoctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? \nPatient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. \nDoctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? \nPatient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. \nDoctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? \nPatient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. \nDoctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. \nPatient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there. \nDoctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? \nPatient: I do have one more to take. \nDoctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? \nPatient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. \nDoctor: You do. Any other issues? \nPatient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. \nDoctor: Are you the husband? \nGuest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. \nDoctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. \nPatient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. \nDoctor: Take care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.<|eot_id|>"}

She was also recommended to see a psychiatrist for her depression. \nDoctor: Did you go and see a psychiatrist? \nPatient: I did. It was okay.\nDoctor: What brings you here today? \nPatient: My headaches are back. They are very severe this time. It all happened that, after that scan. \nDoctor: When did she have her scan? \nGuest_clinician: She had her stunt adjusted which was after the M R I on April eighteenth. \nPatient: Yes, and after that I'm having these very bad headaches. \nDoctor: Are you able to sleep in the night properly? \nPatient: No, these headaches wake me up in the night. I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages. \nDoctor: Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it? \nPatient: Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down.\nDoctor: Is it like specific to any particular area of your head? \nPatient: It is like all over but, uh, very much intense in the forehead. \nDoctor: Is there any nausea associated with the headaches? \nPatient: No. \nDoctor: Anything else that happens along with these headaches? \nPatient: Yeah, I get that ringing sound in my ears, and I just don't feel well. \nDoctor: Any changes in your vision? \nPatient: Yeah, it gets blurry, and I feel like lights are dimming. I will be meeting Doctor Y tomorrow. \nDoctor: Any other thing you want to add? \nPatient: No, that's it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.<|eot_id|>"}

What are you experiencing right now?\nPatient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.\nDoctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well.

Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal. 2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with. 3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications. 4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications. 5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.

I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct? \nPatient: Yes doctor, that's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand? \nPatient: I use my right hand for everything. \nDoctor: Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?\nPatient: I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: What were your initial symptoms? \nPatient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too. \nDoctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?\nPatient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \nPatient: That means tumor, right?\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.<|eot_id|>"}

It seems like you have a lot of weakness and pain in the S one nerve root distribution.\nPatient: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?\nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \nPatient: Will I be asleep for the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the S1 nerve root distribution.

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: How is your pain today? \nPatient: Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly. \nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it? \nPatient: I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable. \nDoctor: Is the pain localized to one area? \nPatient: Yeah. \nDoctor: And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body? \nPatient: Nope.  \nDoctor: Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all? \nPatient: Not yet. \nDoctor: Any back pain?  \nPatient: Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs. \nDoctor: Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain? \nPatient: No, no pins and needles. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing stiffness in your back? \nPatient: The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.  \nDoctor: Has it impacted your sleep at all? \nPatient: Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now. \nDoctor: This accident sure did a number on you. \nPatient: No kidding. \nDoctor: You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? \nPatient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. \nDoctor: I see. \nPatient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. \nDoctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, correct. \nDoctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? \nPatient: A little bit, but not much. \nDoctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? \nPatient: It's stayed more or less the same. \nDoctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? \nPatient: Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias.   Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient's activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain.<|eot_id|>"}

It feels like everything is in my chest. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for this?\nPatient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out.

He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.<|eot_id|>"}

I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.\nDoctor: Okay.\nPatient: My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year. \nDoctor: Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness? \nPatient: Yes, there was the fever and chills.

At time of his assessment in the emergency room, he noted general malaise and fatigue for eight months. Over this same time period he had subjective fevers and chills, night sweats, and a twenty-pound weight loss. He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful. He had been seen for this at the onset of symptoms and given a course of antibiotics without improvement. Over the last several months there had been chronic drainage of yellowish material from this testicle. He denied trauma to this area. He denied diarrhea or constipation, changes in his urinary habits, rashes or skin changes, arthritis, arthralgias, abdominal pain, headache or visual changes.<|eot_id|>"}

Did you feel any other symptoms? \nPatient: I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started. \nDoctor: Interesting. Did you take any medication for that? \nPatient: I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right? \nPatient: Yeah, that's right. \nDoctor: How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics? \nPatient: Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak.\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened? \nPatient: I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall. \nDoctor: How high were you when you fell?\nPatient: I think I was three or five feet high when I fell. \nDoctor: Did you fall on your back?\nPatient: No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back.  \nDoctor: Funny. Did anything hurt after your fall?\nPatient: Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back. \nDoctor: Did you always have that pain? \nPatient: No, I haven't. It comes and goes. \nDoctor: Have you done anything to treat it? \nPatient: I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back. \nDoctor: I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this? \nPatient: No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor. \nDoctor: Okay. So, it wasn't the result of the adjustments. Is there anything else that may have caused it? \nPatient: I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper. \nDoctor: It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?\nPatient: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication. \nDoctor: I see. I have one more question.

He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems.

What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}

She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.<|eot_id|>"}

Please help me summarize dialogues between doctors and patients.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDoctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?\n Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. \nDoctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?\nPatient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. \nDoctor: Can you locate where the pain is?\nPatient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  \nDoctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. \nPatient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. \nDoctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?\nPatient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. \nDoctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?\nPatient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. \nDoctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?\nPatient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. \nDoctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.\nPatient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.<|eot_id|>"}

So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. \nGuest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? \nDoctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.\nGuest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? \nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. \nGuest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? \nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \nGuest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? \nDoctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. \nGuest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey? Would you like to do this?\nPatient: Yeah, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\nGuest_family: I agree, Doctor, we'll do the surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient is a 13-year-old girl who presented in November with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis.  She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm taking narcotics now because it's so bad. \nDoctor: Are you able to do any activities?\nPatient: No, the pain is messing with my daily living, activities are out of the question. \nDoctor: I think we should do another hip replacement on the left, ma'am. \nPatient: Me too, can you remind me the risk of infection from this surgery?\nDoctor: Well, historically it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \nPatient: Good, and will I be asleep for this?\nDoctor: Yes, the whole time. You won't feel a thing. \nPatient: Good, yes, I want to do this procedure.\nDoctor: The other risks include scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.
