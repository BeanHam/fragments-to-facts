"Peters, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J), rendered August 4, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and conspiracy in the sixth degree.
In satisfaction of an eight-count indictment stemming from the seizure of a handgun and quantities of cocaine, marihuana and ecstacy from the residence of defendant and his codefendant, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree agreeing that his respective prison sentences would be 10 years with a term of postrelease supervision and 2 Vs to 6 years, and he waived his right to appeal. While in jail awaiting sentencing, defendant and his codefendant were caught attempting to smuggle contraband into the jail and, at sentencing on the original two counts, defendant pleaded guilty to an additional misdemeanor count in satisfaction of charges arising from that incident and also consented to an increase in the previously agreed-upon sentences for the original two counts. County Court then sentenced defendant to, among other things, concurrent terms of imprisonment of 13 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, 2Vs to 7 years on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and 30 days for the misdemeanor charge. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we note that, inasmuch as he has failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review (see People v Phillips, 41 AD3d 969, 969-970 [2007]; People v Daniels, 16 AD3d 780, 780 [2005]; People v Rich, 10 AD3d 739, 740 [2004]). In any event, if we were to address defendant’s contention we would find it to be without merit. A review of the transcript of the plea allocution reveals that defendant was fully apprised of his rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty and affirmatively communicated to County Court his understanding and desire to plead guilty. Thus, we are satisfied that defendant’s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Daniels, 16 AD3d at 780; People v Rich, 10 AD3d at 740). Furthermore, in light of defendant’s express denial upon questioning by County Court that coercion, force or threats played any part in his decision to plead guilty and that he declined an opportunity to speak at his sentencing hearing and made no attempt to withdraw his plea, his present assertion that he was coerced is not supported in the record before us. Additionally, we conclude that, under the present circumstances, the vague, unsubstantiated letter concerning his codefendant submitted to County Court by a nonparty following the entry of defendant’s plea did not trigger a duty on the part of County Court to inquire further at defendant’s sentencing into whether he was coerced (see People v Wagoner, 30 AD3d 629, 630 [2006]; People v Rich, 10 AD3d at 740; compare People v Moore, 244 AD2d 706, 706-707 [1997]).
Finally, defendant’s contention that County Court erred in referring to the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as a class A felony is meritless. When read in context, it is clear that County Court properly treated the weapons charge as a class D felony, as defendant’s sentence of 2Vs to 7 years on that charge reflects (see Penal Law § 70.00). As a result, defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and an improper sentence premised on this assertion are unavailing.

The letter was apparently written by a member of the community in support of a lengthy sentence for defendant’s codefendant, but it contains, in passing, a claim that “[defendant] pleaded guilty out of fear of [his codefendant’s] father, who has been paying for [defendant’s] attorney.” Importantly, defendant made no such assertion before County Court and makes no such assertion to this Court.",,719,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered September 29, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.
In full satisfaction of three separate indictments charging defendant with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a term of 15 years to life in prison. He raises a number of claims on appeal, the most prominent of which is that the plea allocution was insufficient because it failed to establish that defendant knowingly possessed four ounces or more of cocaine. Initially, insofar as the record discloses that defendant entered into a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal in connection with the plea agreement, we find that defendant may not now seek to challenge the sufficiency of the plea allocution. In any event, even if defendant did not waive his right to appeal, defendant failed to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the plea allocution for review. Significantly, he did not raise an objection to the adequacy of the plea as to his knowledge of the weight of the cocaine or to County Court’s inclusion of the drug analysis report in the record (see, People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10). We have considered defendant’s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered September 8, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
During a home visit, defendant’s parole officer allegedly found crack cocaine, heroin and other drugs and packaging materials in defendant’s apartment and he was thereafter charged by indictment with six drug-related felonies and a misdemeanor. Pursuant to a plea agreement that included an appeal waiver, defendant entered a guilty plea under count 2 of the indictment to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, admitting that he had possessed morphine with intent to sell it. Consistent with that agreement, he was sentenced, as an admitted second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony, to a prison term of 11 years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal is valid. At the time of the waiver, defendant was 32 years old and had a criminal history that stretched back more than 12 years and that included a conviction for a violent felony (see generally People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]). During the colloquy with defendant, County Court elicited defendant’s assurance that he understood that the “right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights . . . automatically forfeited by [the] plea of guilty.” Defendant also assured the court that he understood that such a waiver would not affect his right to appeal on a number of grounds that the court had listed for him. More generally, defendant agreed that he understood the difference between those rights that he was giving up and those rights that he would retain in regard to a waiver of the right to appeal. This colloquy was sufficient to demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d at 341-342 [2015]; People v Handly, 122 AD3d 1007, 1008 [2014]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 969 [2014]; People v Wolz, 112 AD3d 1150, 1151-1152 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1026 [2014]). That valid waiver forecloses review of defendant’s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]).

"Devine, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered January 30, 2014, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
In July 2012, defendant was charged by felony complaint with crimes after crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia were recovered from his vehicle during a traffic stop. He was represented by the Ulster County Public Defender’s office and, two months later, an Assistant Public Defender executed a revocable waiver of defendant’s speedy trial rights in order to engage in plea negotiations. In January 2013, an indictment was handed up that charged defendant with various offenses and the People declared readiness for trial.
Defendant thereafter retained new counsel and rejected a plea offer to resolve the charges against him. Defendant also moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds which, based upon the speedy trial waiver executed by former counsel, was denied. The ensuing jury trial ended with defendant’s conviction of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of eight years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.
Defendant’s arguments on this appeal relate to alleged deficiencies in the performance of counsel. Former counsel embraced a valid strategy of waiving defendant’s speedy trial rights in order to engage in plea negotiations, and “[t]he People [were] entitled to rely on counsel’s apparent authority to act on defendant’s behalf and delay their case” (People v Garcia, 33 AD3d 1050, 1052 [2006], lv denied 9 NY3d 844 [2007]; see People v McCorkle, 67 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2009]). Defendant notes that another Assistant Public Defender kept the possibility of a future speedy trial objection open by refusing to consent to adjournments sought and obtained by the People before Justice Court (compare CPL 30.30 [4] [b]). Contrary to defendant’s contention, there was nothing objectively inconsistent in executing a speedy trial waiver while also objecting to delays that, if they persisted beyond a potential revocation of that waiver, would be chargeable to the People. Defendant therefore failed to “demonstrate the absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel’s failure” as is required to “overcome the strong presumption that defense counsel rendered effective assistance” (People v Ambers, 26 NY3d 313, 317 [2015] [internal quotations marks and citations omitted]; see People v Bond, 110 AD3d 1366, 1367 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1197 [2014]).
Defendant further asserts that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him of the advantages and disadvantages of accepting a proposed plea agreement as opposed to proceeding to trial. The record shows that defendant was made aware of the offer by former counsel, that an adjournment was granted so that defense counsel could, among other things, consider it, and that defendant then rejected it. Inasmuch as there is no record proof as to what defendant was (or was not) advised prior to rejecting the plea offer, his contention must be raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1564 [2017]; People v Santiago, 118 AD3d 1032, 1032-1033 [2014]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered October 11, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In 2007, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced, pursuant to the plea agreement, to a term of imprisonment of three years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.
Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea and his claim that his sentence was improperly limited are not preserved for our review (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], Iv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]). Furthermore, this case does not fall within the rare exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; see also People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]), and reversal in the interest of justice is not warranted here. Contrary to defendant’s argument, our review of the record reveals that there were no promises made regarding defendant’s enrollment in the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment program if he pleaded guilty (see People v Wrobel, 57 AD3d 1499, 1500 [2008]; People v Martin, 55 AD3d 1304, 1304 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 899 [2008]; cf. People v Armstead, 52 AD3d 966, 967-968 [2008]).
Defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is similarly unavailing. The record reflects that defendant received a favorable plea and there is nothing that casts doubt on the effectiveness of his counsel (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]). Finally, we are not persuaded that defendant’s sentence was harsh and excessive. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence and we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances in the record warranting a reduction of his sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Clapper, 51 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2008]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered September 18, 2003, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In 1998, after waiving indictment, defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In satisfaction of the charges, she pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to four months in jail and five years’ probation. Shortly thereafter, she was permitted to continue on probation even though she had apparently violated its terms. In December 2002, however, defendant was charged in a second petition with violating the terms of her probation after she tested positive for cocaine use on five occasions and falsely reported to her probation officer that she was employed full time. Defendant admitted to the allegations contained in the petition and waived her right to a hearing. Although it was established that defendant would receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison as a result of the violation, defense counsel requested County Court to consider medical evaluations and permit defendant to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment before imposing sentence. County Court agreed. Sentencing was thereafter repeatedly adjourned over the course of the ensuing nine months. During this time, defendant missed appointments with her probation officer as well as sessions in her outpatient rehabilitation program, resulting in her discharge, and forged a note from her doctor. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant to the 2 to 6-year prison term originally agreed to as part of the plea.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant’s history of drug use and demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the terms of her probation despite having been given many opportunities to do so over the course of a long period of time suggests that incarceration is the appropriate alternative. This, together with the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea agreement, leads us to conclude that there are neither extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Thompson, 4 AD3d 626, 627 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 649 [2004]; People v Murphy, 257 AD2d 766, 767 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 876 [1999]).

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered July 9, 1992, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing concurrent sentences of 121/2 to 25 years imprisonment for the defendant’s convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (one count) which are to run consecutively to concurrent sentences of 12x/2 to 25 years and 71h to 15 years for the defendant’s convictions of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (one count) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of the branches of the defendant’s omnibus motion which were to suppress identification testimony and physical evidence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that all the sentences shall be concurrent; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
Under Indictment No. 168/92, the defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree for his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer on November 13, 1991. The same indictment also charged the defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree for unlawfully possessing cocaine with an aggregate weight of 1/s ounce or more on November 21, 1991, and for possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it on the same date.
The defendant contends that the undercover police officer’s viewing of a photograph of him two days after the November 13, 1991, transaction was unduly suggestive. However, as the County Court correctly found, this identification procedure was purely confirmatory, i.e., to ascertain whether the correct individual would be arrested (cf., People v Waring, 183 AD2d 271, 273; see also, People v Veale, 169 AD2d 939, affd 78 NY2d 1022).
The record reveals that the defendant’s trial counsel provided him with meaningful representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; People v Jefferson, 156 AD2d 716).
The defendant’s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated.
The defendant’s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]) or without merit. Santucci, J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered December 12, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to fours years in prison, to be followed by an undisclosed period of postrelease supervision. At sentencing, County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of imprisonment, along with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea should be vacated as it was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent due to the fact that he was not advised of the specific length of mandatory postrelease supervision prior to sentencing.
We reverse. Initially, as defendant’s challenge relates to the voluntariness of his plea, it survives any appeal waiver (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 888 [2010]). Further, defendant was not required to preserve this issue in a postallocution motion (see People v Boyd, 12 NY3d 390, 393 [2009]; People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]; People v Rucker, 67 AD3d 1126, 1127 n [2009]). Turning to the merits, “[a] defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action” (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; accord People v Wade, 86 AD3d 713, 714 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 823 [2011]). Moreover, “[i]n order to satisfy the demands of due process, a defendant must be aware of not only the existence of the postrelease supervision component to a sentence, but also the promised or potential duration of that component if a negotiated sentence is a part of the plea agreement” (People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232). Here, the record reflects, as the People concede, that while the plea agreement included a specific negotiated sentence and a mention of postrelease supervision, defendant was never advised by the court of either a promised specific duration or the potential range of the mandatory postrelease supervision component prior to sentencing. Accordingly, his decision to plead guilty was not a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one and, therefore, the judgment of conviction must be reversed and the plea vacated (see People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232).

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County, rendered June 17, 1977, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term of from three years to life. Judgment affirmed. There is no need to resolve the question of when the prosecutor should have apprised defendant of the existence of ""twenty something” additional tapes, since the fact is that (as shown in the voir dire transcripts) defense counsel, after having conducted his voir dire of the jury, was apprised of the additional tapes and was given an opportunity —which he utilized—to examine them. Prejudice might have resulted from this alleged eleventh hour disclosure of the additional tapes only if defense counsel had not been granted the right to inspect them or, if having inspected them, he had been denied a mistrial, or had been granted a mistrial solely on the condition which the defendant claims the prosecutor imposed, viz., that the defenses of entrapment and agency be waived. At bar, however, it is manifest from the voir dire minutes and the plea and sentence minutes that, on the basis of the examination of the additional tapes, defendant and his counsel concluded that there was no merit to their proposed defenses and that the best course for defendant would be to enter the proffered guilty plea and obtain the sentence which was ultimately imposed. Thus, at page 31 of the voir dire minutes of May 6, 1977 defense counsel stated: ""I saw some tapes yesterday; of course, they weren’t originals. They were handwritten. The language is incomprehensible to me but in talking with the police officers, and in talking With Miss Brill, the jury might easily infer certain things which might be inhumanible [sic] to a defense of entrapment. Again, I say it’s a matter of interpretation. Now I could not ethically urge that defense in the light of what I have since found. I also, Your Honor, wish to absolve Miss Brill of any ill doing in this case. I’m sure that as just as soon as she found out about the tapes, she came rushing into Court just like they do on the T.V. I say that because Miss Brill kept talking about T.V., that nothing traumaticly [sic] is going to happen, and in fact, it did. I assure the Court that had I been aware of those tapes, I would not have urged the defense of entrapment. I can’t in good conscience do that, and I wouldn’t do it even at this late date.” We also find that the sentence imposed was not an abuse of discretion under the facts of this case. Hopkins, J.

"Yesawich Jr., J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered April 28, 1995, which resentenced defendant following his conviction upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Previously, this Court determined, inter alia, that defendant should have been accorded a hearing on his challenge to the constitutionality of his 1982 felony conviction (212 AD2d 935, lv denied 85 NY2d 916) and remitted the matter to County Court to hold such hearing. That hearing has been held, and County Court has found that defendant failed to overcome the burden of proving that this conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and resentenced him as a second felony offender. The original sentence, an indeterminate term of 31/2 to 7 years’ incarceration, was allowed to stand and defendant appeals. We affirm.
The applicable criminal procedure law (CPL 400.21 [7] [b]), and controlling precedent (People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9), squarely place the burden ""upon the defendant to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim that [his] conviction was unconstitutionally obtained” (supra, at 15; see, People v Robare, 226 AD2d 837, 838). Defendant has simply failed to carry his burden. Nothing in the remittal hearing transcript manifests that defendant’s 1982 guilty plea was other than knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. When asked specific questions regarding that plea allocution, defendant professed neither to know nor remember what occurred at that time. As for the purportedly supportive testimony of defendant’s brother, who pleaded guilty in 1982 together with defendant, it adds not one iota to defendant’s claim. Furthermore, the transcript of the plea proceeding, though seemingly essential to defendant’s case, is lacking from his proof on the issue.
And, although defendant suggests otherwise, we are of the view that County Court’s decision complied with the statutory mandate that it ""make a finding as to whether or not the defendant has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction” (CPL 400.21 [7] [c]), and further that no extraordinary circumstances exist warranting the disturbance of the court’s sentence (see, People v Simoens, 159 AD2d 818, 820, lv denied 76 NY2d 743; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J), rendered April 27, 2007, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree.
In 2005, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree in full satisfaction of a pending multicount indictment. He also waived his right to appeal in writing which he confirmed during the plea colloquy. County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 15 years to life on the criminal possession count and 3 to 9 years on the conspiracy count. The reduced sentencing provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 did not apply, as the crimes at issue were committed in 2004, before that Act became effective (see L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]; People v Utsey, 7 NY3d 398, 403-404 [2006]; People v Antoniou, 59 AD3d 805, 806 [2009]). Under the terms of the plea agreement and appeal waiver, however, defendant reserved the right to apply for resentencing as provided for by that Act (see L 2004, ch 738, § 23; see also Penal Law § 70.71). It was further agreed that, if he did so, a determinate prison term of no more than 10 and no less than eight years, as well as post-release supervision, would be imposed on the criminal possession count. Upon defendant’s subsequent application for resentencing, County Court imposed a prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of five years on the criminal possession count. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
It is true, of course, that an appeal waiver executed in con-
nection with a guilty plea does not preclude a challenge to the severity of a subsequent resentence if the plea was entered “under conditions that changed following the waiver” (People v Tausinger, 21 AD3d 1181, 1183 [2005]; see People v Gray, 32 AD3d 1052, 1053 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 902 [2006]). In this case, however, when defendant entered into the plea agreement and executed the appeal waiver, while he did not know the precise prison term that would be imposed upon resentencing, he was fully aware of the agreed-upon potential sentence range that could be imposed thereat. Indeed, the written appeal waiver itself discloses the agreed-upon sentencing range that defendant faced at resentencing. As defendant “knew the maximum exposure [he] could face upon pleading guilty,” his valid appeal waiver precludes his present challenge to his resentence as harsh and excessive (People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; see L 2004, ch 738, § 23; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Koweek, J.), rendered May 7, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant, who is not a United States citizen, was charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, which included a waiver of appeal, defendant agreed to plead guilty to both counts in exchange for the People’s recommendation of a three-year prison sentence, three years of postrelease supervision and no opposition to placement in the Willard drug treatment program. Thereafter, consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a predicate felon to two concurrent prison terms of three years — together with three years of postrelease supervision — to be served under parole supervision as part of the Willard drug treatment program pursuant to CPL 410.91. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal was not valid. During the plea colloquy, County Court did not adequately apprise defendant that his appeal rights were separate and distinct from those trial-related rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Mitchell, 144 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2016]). Further, the lengthy written plea agreement in which the waiver of the right to appeal appears does not distinguish in any meaningful way the separate and distinct nature of the appeal waiver (see People v Breault, 150 AD3d 1548, 1548 [2017]; compare People v Corbin, 121 AD3d 803, 803-804 [2014]). As such, we are unable to conclude that “defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver” (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1209 [2017] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264).
Turning to defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant contends that his plea was involuntary because his defense counsel failed to adequately inform him of the deportation consequences of his guilty plea under federal immigration statutes (see 8 USC §§ 1101 [a] [43]; 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, “is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion” (People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]; see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 183, 202-203 [2013]; People v Soprano, 135 AD3d 1243, 1243 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1007 [2016]; cf. People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d 1315, 1316 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016], cert denied 580 US —, 137 S Ct 385 [2016]). Further, our review of the record confirms that defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy or at sentencing that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 182-183; People v Lewis, 143 AD3d at 1185).
In any event, defendant’s claim that he was not properly advised that he could be deported as a consequence of his plea is belied by the record. During the plea colloquy, County Court informed defendant of his potential immigration consequences resulting from his plea, and defendant expressly acknowledged in the written plea agreement that he had been afforded the opportunity to discuss with his attorney the potential deportation consequences resulting from his plea and that he understood that his conviction could result in, among other things, his deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization (see People v Lawrence, 148 AD3d 1472, 1474 [2017]; People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d at 1317; People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014]). Finally, to the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is premised upon matters not appearing on the record before us, defendant must pursue this claim by means of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 202-203; People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d at 1386).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered October 22, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of arson in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In May 2012, defendant was indicted for three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant later waived indictment and was charged by superior court information with an additional charge of arson in the third degree. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of arson in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of all outstanding charges and waived his right to appeal with regard thereto. County Court thereafter sentenced him in accordance with the revised plea agreement to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the maximum being a term of 4 to 12 years, and ordered him to pay restitution. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. With regard to defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, to the extent that such claim is alleged to have impacted the voluntariness of his plea, it survives his appeal waiver; however, it is not preserved for our review as the record does not reflect that he moved to withdraw his plea (see People v Ortiz, 127 AD3d 1416, 1417 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]) and the narrow excep tion to the preservation requirement is inapplicable inasmuch as defendant made no statements during his plea colloquy that would cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Van Clief, 122 AD3d 1062, 1063 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1221 [2015]). Further, to the extent that defendant contends that counsel made certain misrepresentations regarding the terms of the plea agreement, such claims involve matters outside the record and, therefore, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061-1062 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [2015]; People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1271 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]).
Additionally, upon review of the plea colloquy and defendant’s written waiver, we find that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Viele, 130 AD3d 1097, 1097 [2015]). In light of defendant’s valid appeal waiver, defendant is precluded from challenging the agreed-upon sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Tyler, 130 AD3d 1383, 1385 [2015]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered October 28, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court (Eidens, J.), rendered June 9, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Facing a four-count indictment related to his alleged sale of cocaine on November 19, 2002, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a promised prison term of 3 to 9 years. Additionally, defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and acknowledged, after receiving instructions from County Court and signing a Parker admonishment, that his sentence could be enhanced if he was involved in another violation of the law before sentencing. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested and indicted for criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, involving the sale of cocaine to an undercover officer. Following an evidentiary hearing, County Court determined that the prosecution established sufficient grounds to enhance defendant’s sentence and consequently sentenced defendant to a prison term of 6 to 18 years. Subsequently, with respect to the second indictment, defendant entered a plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison term of 6V2 to 19V2 years to run concurrent with the prior sentence. Defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was subsequently sentenced as agreed. Defendant now appeals from both judgments.
We affirm. An agreed-upon sentence may be enhanced if it is appropriately established that the defendant has violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Baxter, 302 AD2d 950, 951 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]; People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63, 69 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 967 [2000]). Here, defendant contends that County Court lacked the authority to impose an enhanced sentence since defendant did hot violate any condition of the Parker admonishment or the plea bargain agreement. At the time that defendant entered his plea, he acknowledged, in relevant part, that he understood the court’s oral instruction that if he were to be involved in the commission of another crime, the sentence could be enhanced. Additionally, defendant executed a written Parker admonishment which provided, in relevant part, that “if you violate the law before being sentenced . . . the Court will be free to sentence you to any lawful sentence the Court feels appropriate.” Specifically, defendant asserts that he was never advised that simply being arrested could result in the enhancement of the agreed-upon sentence. It is defendant’s position that under the terms of the Parker admonishment and plea bargain agreement, the sentence could not be enhanced unless and until it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed another crime.
Any inconsistency between the terms of the written Parker admonishment and the oral instructions of the trial court must be resolved in favor of the defendant (see Spence v Superintendent, Great Meadow Correctional Facility, 219 F3d 162, 169 [2000]). Notwithstanding County Court’s misstatement regarding the proof necessary to establish a predicate for enhancement of the sentence—“arrest” rather than a “violation of the law” (see People v Clough, 306 AD2d 556, 556-557 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]), we conclude that the testimony of the undercover officer that she purchased cocaine from defendant satisfactorily established that defendant violated the law. Under these circumstances, enhancement of the sentence was proper.
Turning to defendant’s argument that his plea of guilty under the second indictment was not voluntary, we note that he did not move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction. Under these circumstances, any challenge to the voluntariness of the plea has not been preserved for our review (see People v Booth [I], 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005], lvs denied 6 NY3d 846, 849 [2006]; People v Santalucia, 19 AD3d 806, 807 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 856 [2005]). In any event, were we to reach the issue, we would conclude that defendant’s challenge is meritless since the plea colloquy unquestionably establishes that defendant knew and understood the consequences of his plea and that he committed the elements of the offense charged (see People v Cherry, 12 AD3d 949, 949 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 797 [2005]). Defendant’s present claim of innocence is wholly unsubstantiated, providing no basis upon which to vacate the plea (see People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711 [1999]).
The two remaining contentions of defendant are equally unpersuasive. Defendant’s contention that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing before County Court to determine whether he had violated the law does not survive his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Williams, 17 AD3d 783, 784 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 796 [2005]). In any event, the record demonstrates effectiveness as the Public Defender made appropriate objections, conducted meaningful examinations of witnesses and offered a persuasive argument in defendant’s favor (see People v Kyzer, 21 AD3d 1212, 1213-1214 [2005]). Finally, defendant’s contention that the provisions of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act should be retroactively applied to reduce his sentences (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [a], [b]) has previously been rejected. The provisions of the law, with an exception not here applicable, are prospective only (see People v Clinton, 22 AD3d 887, 888 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 811 [2006]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered February 20, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. On appeal, she contends, inter alia, that CPL 410.91, which creates a sentencing option of parole supervision for a defendant with a history of controlled substance dependence, deprives her of equal protection of the law because she is not a drug-dependent individual. We rejected this argument in People v Kinch (237 AD2d 830, 831, lv denied 90 NY2d 860), wherein we observed that: “In view of the current nationwide drug crisis and the criminal conduct engendered thereby, it cannot be seriously argued that legislation targeting drug-dependent individuals and providing for intensive drug treatment in lieu of incarceration does not bear a reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective” (id., at 831). Therefore, we find defendant’s equal protection challenge to be without merit. Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be unpersuasive.

Appeals (1) from an order of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), dated January 22, 2008, which denied defendant’s motion to withdraw her plea of guilty, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered February 11, 2008, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of a superior court information charging her with two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree. As a condition of the plea, defendant waived her right to appeal. At sentencing, she personally requested that County Court permit her to withdraw her plea of guilty, asserting that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court then assigned new counsel and adjourned sentencing to allow defendant to prepare a formal motion to withdraw, which she thereafter filed. The court denied the motion and sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a three-year term of probation and imposed a fine. The court also issued an order of protection prohibiting defendant from having any unsupervised contact with children under the age of 18 not related to her within six degrees of consanguinity. Defendant appeals from both the order denying her motion to withdraw her plea of guilty and the judgment of conviction.
Initially, we note that “[a]ppeals in criminal cases are strictly limited to those authorized by statute” (People v Bautista, 7 NY3d 838, 838-839 [2006]; see People v Whalen, 49 AD3d 916, 916 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 940 [2008]). Inasmuch as an order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea does not fall within the provisions of CPL article 450, defendant’s appeal from the order denying her motion must be dismissed (see People v Riley, 25 AD2d 915, 916 [1966]). We note, however, that the merits of defendant’s challenges to the denial of her motion are nevertheless reviewable upon her appeal from the judgment of conviction (see CPL 470.15 [1]).
Turning to the merits, defendant’s challenges to the voluntariness of her plea survive her waiver of the right to appeal and were preserved for our review by her motion to withdraw the plea (see e.g. People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896 [2008]). That said, “ [withdrawal of a plea will not be permitted in the absence of ‘some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement’ ” (People v Graham-Harrison, 272 AD2d 780, 781 [2000] [citation omitted]; see People v Griffin, 4 AD3d 674, 675 [2004]).
Here, defendant asserts that she should have been permitted to withdraw her plea because she mistakenly believed that she was pleading guilty to two class B misdemeanor charges of crim-
inal sale of marihuana in the fifth degree. This argument is belied by the lengthy plea allocution, which reveals that County Court consistently informed defendant that she was pleading to criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree and expressly distinguished the crime from that defined in Penal Law § 221.35, i.e., criminal sale of marihuana in the fifth degree. While notations in the court clerk’s minutes of the plea proceeding mislabeled the crime as a class B misdemeanor, those notations are not consistent with the transcript of the plea allocution itself. In any event, the intended disposition of three years of probation—to which defendant agreed—is not a permissible sentence for a class B misdemeanor conviction (see Penal Law § 65.00 [3]; People v Neal, 41 AD3d 971, 972 [2007]). Furthermore, defendant did not support her claim of mistake with any evidence beyond the clerk’s minutes and transcript of the plea allocution—she did not, for example, submit a sworn statement on her own behalf or from her former defense counsel in connection with the motion to withdraw (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]; People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1065-1066 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]). Finally, we note that the order of protection was not part of the sentence imposed and, thus, County Court’s issuance of that order does not entitle defendant to withdraw her plea (see People v Hull, 52 AD3d 962, 963-964 [2008]; People v Dixon, 16 AD3d 517, 517 [2005]; see also People v Nieves, 2 NY3d 310, 316 [2004]). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw her plea.
Defendant’s remaining arguments are barred by her waiver of the right to appeal.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 2, 2009, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced to a prison term of six years with two years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and, further, that County Court erred in summarily denying defense counsel’s motion to be relieved of her assignment.
“In the absence of an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances, the sentence imposed by the sentencing court will not be disturbed” (People v Flint, 66 AD3d 1245, 1246 [2009] [citations omitted]). Given defendant’s criminal history, we discern no reason to disturb the sentence imposed. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, the fact that the instant offense represents his first felony conviction does not establish extraordinary circumstances (see People v Bonelli, 41 AD3d 972, 974 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 921 [2007]). Similarly, the fact that other individuals who committed the same crime may have received lesser sentences is of no moment, as “no two defendants are quite alike even if they have committed, in legal definition, identical offenses” (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 234 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]).
Turning to the assigned counsel issue, “[t]he right of an indigent criminal defendant to the services of a court-appointed lawyer does not encompass a right to appointment of successive lawyers at defendant’s option” (People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]). Rather, a defendant seeking new assigned counsel must demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution (see id,.; People v Davenport, 58 AD3d 892, 895 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 782 [2009]). No such showing was made here.
When defendant requested a change of counsel in July 2008, County Court questioned defendant extensively as to the basis for his application, summarized counsel’s efforts on defendant’s behalf and ultimately concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution. Two months later, when the Assistant Public Defender representing defendant sought to be relieved of the assignment, County Court again denied the request for new counsel. Based upon our review of the record as a whole, we cannot say that County Court failed to carefully evaluate this request. While the record reflects some dissatisfaction with counsel (see People v Davenport, 58 AD3d at 895), County Court had the opportunity to observe the “ongoing dialogue” between defendant and counsel during the course of this action and concluded that the relationship between the two was “conducive to providing meaningful representation during the course of the trial.” Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered March 20, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant contends on this appeal that the sentence of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment that he received should be reduced because it is disproportionate to the sentence of 3 Vi to 7 years’ imprisonment imposed upon a codefendant and because it is harsh and excessive. The fact that defendant did not receive the same sentence as a codefendant does not require modification of his sentence (see, People v Warden, 141 AD2d 913). Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Considering these facts, as well as defendant’s prior record and the fact that the sentence was not the harshest possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered December 23, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
As the result of an incident in which a quantity of cocaine was found in defendant’s automobile, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a term of 2⅓ to 7 years in prison and required to pay a $5,000 fine. Inasmuch as defendant waived his right to appeal the judgment of conviction, he is precluded from challenging the sentence on the ground that it is harsh and excessive. However, even if we were to consider defendant’s claim on the merits, we would not find, in view of defendant’s admission that he supported himself through the sale of drugs, that the sentence imposed is harsh or excessive. Accordingly, we decline to disturb County
Court’s judgment.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Mc-Keighan, J.), rendered October 12, 2007, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. She pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges and waived her right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, she was sentenced as a second felony offender to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutive to any undischarged sentence. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant urges this Court to remit the matter to County Court for resentencing to include her participation in the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment program. In essence, her claim distills to an argument that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. Significantly, defendant does not challenge the validity of her waiver of the right to appeal, which explicitly encompassed any challenge to the severity of the sentence, and the record reveals that such waiver was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). In view of this, defendant is precluded from seeking a modification of her existing sentence (see People v Rogers, 54 AD3d 1069, 1069 [2008]; People v Collier, 52 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 786 [2008]).

"— Main, J. P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered February 12, 1986, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and promoting prison contraband in the first degree (two counts).
Defendant was found guilty as charged of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. These charges arose from defendant’s role in attempting to transmit a quantity of cocaine and heroin to an inmate at the Albany County Jail. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of iVi to 15 years on the possession counts, IV2 to 15 years on the attempted sale counts and 2 to 4 years on the contraband counts.
On this appeal, defendant first claims that County Court improperly failed to exercise its discretion by not placing its rationale for the denial of her Sandoval motion on the record. Our review of the record reveals that County Court explicitly found that defendant’s prior convictions were not remote in time, would have bearing on defendant’s credibility and showed a propensity to elevate defendant’s own self-interest over that of society. Thus, County Court clearly exercised its discretion in an acceptable manner and defendant’s claim must be rejected. Likewise without merit are defendant’s contentions that County Court should have excluded her prior convictions or, at least, employed a Sandoval compromise by allowing the admission of defendant’s earlier felony conviction without disclosure of the factual incidents. The prior crimes at issue were petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree and did not involve drugs in any way. Thus, these convictions were sufficiently different from the crimes charged in the instant indictment that we cannot say that County Court erred in its ruling on the Sandoval motion. In this regard, we note that County Court properly indicated that it would give an instruction that any prior conviction could only be considered for issues of credibility (see generally, People v Pavao, 59 NY2d 282, 291-292).
We further find no reason to invoke our authority to upset the sentence, which is within the statutory guidelines and cannot be deemed excessive, especially considering defendant’s lengthy and increasingly more serious criminal record. Similarly, we decline to consider defendant’s contention that County Court improperly charged that cocaine and heroin are dangerous contraband within the meaning of the Penal Law. No exceptions or requests were made by defendant concerning the charge and, therefore, this issue has not been preserved for review on appeal.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered April 17, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced, in accordance with a plea agreement, as a second felony offender to a three-year prison term. The basis for sentencing defendant as a second felony offender was a February 1993 conviction of reckless endangerment in the first degree, which he admitted. On appeal, defendant claims that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender because neither the predicate felony statement filed by the People nor the sentencing minutes reflects the date he committed his prior felony or served his four-year period of incarceration.
Defendant correctly states that the second felony offender statement recites that defendant was previously convicted of reckless endangerment in the first degree in February 1993 without referencing the commission date of the prior offense or defendant’s ensuing period of incarceration. At sentencing, however, defense counsel readily acknowledged that he reviewed the presentence report, which clearly reflects that defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment in 1993 for a crime committed in September 1992 and that he was incarcerated between June 1993 and May 1997. Notably, defense counsel denied that the presentence report contained any errors or omissions.
Defense counsel further acknowledged at sentencing that he had received, and reviewed with defendant, the second felony offender statement and that defendant admitted this prior offense. No objection was raised to any omission in the statement, namely, its failure to state the commission date or defendant’s incarceration. Furthermore, at sentencing, County Court addressed defendant himself, specifically inquiring if he was convicted of reckless endangerment in February 1993 and if he was “a predicate offender for purposes of sentencing.” Defendant answered each inquiry in the affirmative.
In our view, the second felony offender statement, coupled with the undisputed facts set forth in the presentence report and all answers to County Court’s inquires by both defense counsel and defendant, establish that defendant had been convicted of a felony offense within the relevant statutory period as tolled by an intervening period of incarceration (see People v McDowell, 56 AD3d 955 [2008]; see also CPL 400.21 [2]; Penal Law § 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]). In other words, there being no actual dispute that defendant indeed served nearly four years in prison between June 1993 and May 1997 and that this period of incarceration adequately tolled the statutory period (compare People v Hilts, 25 AD3d 1019 [2006]), defendant’s sentence will not be disturbed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered July 1, 2017, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree pursuant to a plea agreement that required him to execute a waiver of appeal. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to three years in prison, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claim that County Court failed to advise him that he could controvert the allegations contained in the prior felony information and that he was, therefore, improperly sentenced as a second felony offender survives his unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal, but is unpreserved due to his failure to object at sentencing despite having the opportunity to do so (see People v Berry, 152 AD3d 1080, 1080-1081, 1081 n [2017]; People v Woods, 147 AD3d 1156, 1157 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1089 [2017]; cf. People v Murdie, 134 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2015]). In any event, defendant was provided with a copy of the prior felony information, indicated that he would not contest the allegations therein and admitted the predicate conviction at sentencing. Accordingly, were the issue properly before us, we would conclude that County Court substantially complied with the requirements of CPL 400.21 (3) (see People v Thorpe, 141 AD3d 927, 935 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1031 [2016]; People v Wilkins, 118 AD3d 1038, 1039 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]; People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]).

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Mullen, J.), rendered February 11, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, eligible for persistent felony offender treatment, disposed of an indictment charging a number of drug offenses with a counseled plea of guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prosecution agreement to recommend a sentence of lifetime probation in accordance with Penal Law § 65.00 (1) (b). County Court refused to impose the recommended sentence, however, and denied defendant’s subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty plea upon the ground that defendant left the State and failed to ""provid[e] material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of [drug offenders]” (Penal Law § 65.00 [1] [b] [iii]). The parties then entered into a further agreement whereby the People agreed to forego a contemplated prosecution for bail jumping in the first degree and defendant agreed to accept a sentence of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years on his original plea and, further, waived his right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with that agreement, defendant now appeals.
In view of defendant’s acceptance of the subsequent plea agreement and express waiver of his right to appeal, he may not now challenge County Court’s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 281; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039). Although defendant did exhibit some reluctance in accepting the subsequent plea agreement, a fair reading of the minutes indicates no evidence of threats or coercion but merely defendant’s frustration with the reality of his situation and the prospect of a longer prison term were he to reject the People’s offer (see, People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, lv denied 79 NY2d 949).

Following defendant’s conviction after trial, she was sentenced on January 26, 1984 to an indeterminate prison term of 20 years to life. Underlying defendant’s conviction of this class A-l felony is a sale of cocaine for the sum of $8,800 and her admission to a probation officer that she was a dealer in this substance. The only issue raised on this appeal is the contended excessiveness of the sentence.

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4 tú to 9 years. Defendant contends that evidence found on his person should be suppressed as the police did not have probable cause to arrest him. Three persons told police that defendant had been attempting to sell illegal substances. We conclude that this fact, together with police knowledge that the area had a high incidence of drug trafficking and defendant’s flight when approached by police, was sufficient to establish probable cause for defendant’s arrest.

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate sentence of 7 to 14 years in prison. Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, this issue has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Nevertheless, were we to reach this issue, we would find no evidence of extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion warranting a modification of the sentence imposed in the interest of justice given, inter alia, defendant’s lengthy criminal history and the underlying circumstances (see, People v Blair, 263 AD2d 614; People v Brown, 251 AD2d 694, lv denied 92 NY2d 1029).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Aison, J.), rendered April 16, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
The People initially indicated that they were willing to allow defendant to plead guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and to be sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. County Court would not agree to the plea premised on this sentence and required that defendant be sentenced to 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment. Defendant agreed to this plea arrangement and subsequently pleaded guilty, with County Court imposing the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant now contends that County Court failed to exercise its discretion in agreeing to a determined sentence before considering defendant’s presentencing report, that County Court erred in considering unreliable information in the presentence report and that the sentence is harsh and excessive.
We find that County Court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing defendant. Nothing in the record indicates that County Court felt constrained to acquiesce to the People’s plea offer. To the contrary, County Court found that it could not agree to the People’s offer and made its own offer based upon the circumstances of the case known at that time, including defendant’s criminal record. Further, County Court accepted the plea conditioned upon defendant’s acceptable behavior during the period between the plea and sentencing, and the presentence report did not contain information that would compel County Court to find the agreement inappropriate. This case is thus distinguishable from People v Farrar (52 NY2d 302), cited by defendant, in which the sentencing court failed to exercise its own discretion at sentencing. Here, County Court clearly imposed sentence only after considering defendant’s particular circumstances.
We also reject defendant’s contention that information in the presentence report indicating that he had been in a substance abuse program because his parole officer believed that he had a drug problem was unreliable and requires reversal. This information was based upon defendant’s own statements which he has not shown were inaccurate (see, People v Anderson, 184 AD2d 922, lv denied 80 NY2d 901). In addition, defense counsel was given the opportunity to review and comment on the report but failed to do so (see, supra; People v Tumerman, 133 AD2d 714, lv denied 70 NY2d 938, cert denied 485 US 969). Given defendant’s present offense and his past conviction of a drug-related offense, County Court’s conclusion that defendant had a substance abuse problem was reasonable despite defendant’s denials.
Finally, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court in view of defendant’s criminal record and the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of his plea taken in satisfaction of a six-count indictment (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"Egan Jr., J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (McGinty, J.), rendered August 30, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In September 2005, defendant was charged in an eight-count indictment with various drug-related offenses. Thereafter, in July 2006, defendant — in full satisfaction of the foregoing indictment — pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and, in September 2006, was sentenced to the agreed-upon term of 10 years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Four years later, defendant filed a pro se CPL article 440 motion contending, among other things, that his sentence had been illegally imposed based upon a misapprehension as to the aggregate weight required to sustain his conviction under Penal Law § 220.18. The People did not oppose this request and, in May 2011, County Court granted defendant’s motion, vacated the plea and sentence and scheduled the matter for further proceedings. Defendant appeared before County Court on May 25, 2011, at which time he was assigned counsel and the matter was adjourned to afford counsel an opportunity to review defendant’s file.
In June 2011, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree — again in full satisfaction of the underlying indictment — in exchange for a prison term of seven years (subject to credit for time served) followed by two years of postrelease supervision. During the course of the plea colloquy, an extensive discussion was had with regard to whether defendant had a prior, valid felony conviction. Ultimately, the People agreed to treat defendant as a first felony offender, and no prior felony statement was filed. When defendant returned for sentencing in August 2011, he indicated that he wished to proceed pro se. Following a colloquy with defendant and assigned counsel, County Court granted defendant’s request and thereafter sentenced him to the agreed-upon prison term. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Defendant initially contends that the underlying indictment was jurisdictionally defective due to errors in the indictment number itself and in the list of charges contained on the indictment backer. “Although . . . a jurisdictional defect in an indictment is not waived by a guilty plea and may be raised for the first time on appeal!,] . . . not every defect in an indictment is a jurisdictional defect for these purposes. In essence, an indictment is jurisdictionally defective only if it does not effectively charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime” (People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978] [citations omitted]; see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1023 [2013]). Here, there is no question that the subject indictment, which incorporated by reference the statutory provisions applicable to the crimes charged therein, was sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d at 1023-1024; People v Brown, 75 AD3d 655, 656 [2010]), and the typographical errors of which defendant now complains “constitute . . . technical, nonjurisdictional defect[s] that [were] waived by defendant’s guilty plea” (People v Olmstead, 111 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2013]; see People v Porath, 104 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1019 [2013]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]).
As for the arguments made by defendant in his pro se brief, defendant cannot challenge County Court’s decision granting his CPL article 440 motion and vacating his 2006 plea and sentence because, having successfully obtained the very relief he sought, defendant is not an aggrieved party within the meaning of CPLR 5511 (see generally People v Baker, 131 AD2d 491, 491-492 [1987], lv denied 70 NY2d 709 [1987]). With respect to defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant’s present contentions — that counsel failed to properly investigate his case and provided inadequate or erroneous advice — implicate matters outside of the record and, as such, are more appropriately addressed in the context of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]; People v Alnutt, 107 AD3d 1139, 1144-1145 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014]). To the extent that the balance of defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea, such claim is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Horton, 140 AD3d 1525, 1525 [2016]; People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]). “Further, the narrow exception to the preservation rule was not triggered here, as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt” (People v Perkins, 140 AD3d 1401, 1403 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).
Nor are we persuaded that County Court erred in granting defendant’s request to proceed pro se at the time of sentencing. “A criminal defendant may be permitted to proceed pro se if the request is timely and unequivocal, there has been a know ing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, and defendant has not engaged in conduct that would interfere with a fair and orderly [proceeding]” (People v Hamilton, 133 AD3d 1090, 1093 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Brooks, 140 AD3d 1780, 1781 [2016]). When faced with such a request, County Court must “engage[ ] in the requisite inquiry, examining defendant’s education, occupation, previous exposure to legal procedures and other relevant factors bearing on a competent, intelligent, voluntary waiver” (People v Hamilton, 133 AD3d at 1093 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Brooks, 140 AD3d at 1781). Here, defendant made a timely and unequivocal request to proceed pro se, in response to which County Court questioned defendant as to his legal knowledge and experience and inquired as to whether defendant was aware of the risks that self-representation might entail; defendant, in turn, reiterated his desire to proceed pro se. In addition to the information gleaned during the colloquy with defendant, County Court was aware that, despite a lack of formal education or training, defendant had prevailed on his pro se motion to vacate his prior conviction and sentence. Under these circumstances, we have no quarrel with County Court’s decision to permit defendant to proceed pro se at the time of sentencing.
As a final matter, defendant argues that his already-completed sentence should be vacated due to the People’s failure to file a prior felony statement pursuant to CPL 400.21. During the course of the plea colloquy, County Court inquired as to whether the instant offense was defendant’s second felony offense. Defense counsel acknowledged that defendant had a prior felony conviction, but indicated that defendant was asserting “that the prior conviction cannot count as a predicate for this case because the original sentence was illegal.” Upon further inquiry by County Court, defendant clarified that he was contending that the plea underlying the prior conviction was “unlawful,” in response to which County Court indicated that it would afford defense counsel time to explore and resolve the issue of whether defendant was in fact a predicate felon. Following additional discussion, the People — reasoning that defendant’s felony offender status would not affect the previously agreed-upon sentence one way or the other — indicated that they would not “seek the prior felony” and were content to have defendant sentenced as a first felony offender. Accordingly, no prior felony statement was filed, and defendant thereafter was sentenced both in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement and to a term of imprisonment consistent with the sentencing range applicable to a first felony offender.
Assuming, without deciding, that the People’s failure to file a prior felony statement (see CPL 400.21) has been preserved for our review (see People v Brown, 70 AD3d 1302, 1305 [2010], affd, 17 NY3d 742 [2011]; compare People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52 [2000], with People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636 [1983]), we find the People’s omission in this regard to be harmless error and, further, that granting the pro se relief requested by defendant — vacating the sentence previously imposed and remitting for resentencing — would, under the particular facts of this case, “be futile and pointless” (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; accord People v Fuentes, 140 AD3d 1656, 1657 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1072 [2016]; People v Leon, 23 AD3d 1110, 1112 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 755 [2005]; People v Dawson, 269 AD2d 867, 868 [2000]). As noted previously, defendant, who actually benefitted from the People’s failure to comply with CPL 400.21 and, hence, suffered no prejudice as a result of this omission, has served his sentence, and his period of postrelease supervision has expired. Accordingly, remitting this matter for resentencing would serve no purpose other than to potentially expose defendant to an additional period of incarceration. Defendant’s remaining contentions, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.

. Defendant’s 2006 guilty plea was premised upon his possession of two ounces of cocaine, but a 2004 amendment to Penal Law § 220.18 had increased the aggregate weight required for that crime from two ounces to four ounces (see L 2004, ch 738, § 21).

Defendant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. After his release on parole, he was again arrested and pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and was returned to prison. Defendant subsequently moved to be resentenced pursuant to CPL 440.46, but was released on parole prior to a determination being made on his application. County Court dismissed his application on the basis that defendant was ineligible to apply for resentencing because of his status as a parole violator and the fact that he was no longer incarcerated. Defendant now appeals.
As the People concede, reversal is required. Defendant’s status as a parole violator does not preclude County Court from considering his application (see People v Paulin, 17 NY3d 238, 244 [2011]), although it may be taken into account by the court when determining whether or not to grant the application (see id.; People v Devivo, 87 AD3d 794, 796 [2011]). Further, insofar as defendant was in custody when he applied for resentencing, the fact that he has subsequently been released does not render his application moot (see People v Santiago, 17 NY3d 246, 248-249 [2011]). Therefore, the order must be reversed and the matter remitted to County Court for further proceedings.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered July 11, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced in accordance with his plea agreement to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant argues on appeal that his sentence was harsh and excessive in light of his difficult childhood. Given defendant’s past criminal history and the fact that the agreed-upon sentence was within the statutory guidelines, we find defendant’s contention unpersuasive (see, People v Keller, 200 AD2d 843, lv denied 83 NY2d 873). Additionally, as defendant received a more favorable plea bargain than was originally offered, we find defendant’s contention that he was denied equal protection to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered January 9, 1992, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts).
Defendant was convicted of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant initially contends that County Court committed error when it required disclosure of a single page of notes made by defendant’s counsel during the course of a pretrial interview of a defense witness prior to direct testimony. We disagree. Under CPL 240.45 (2) (a), a defendant has an obligation to turn over to the People ""any written or recorded statement made by a person other than the defendant whom the defendant intends to call as a witness at the trial, and which relates to the subject matter of the witness’s testimony”. This disclosure is required to be made ""[ajfter presentation of the people’s direct case and before the presentation of the defendant’s direct case” (CPL 240.45 [2]). Because defense counsel took no pretrial statement from the witness, the notes were properly considered as a substitute (see, People v Huhn, 140 AD2d 760, 762, lv denied 72 NY2d 919). We note that County Court redacted the notes to delete the proposed questions which defense counsel intended to ask and thus only required disclosure of those portions that were deemed declarative. We discern no prejudice to defendant in the court’s use of this procedure (see, supra, at 762).
Defendant next contends that County Court erred in allowing the jury to use tape transcripts during its deliberations. Here, the audibility of the tape recordings and the accuracy of the corresponding transcripts had been established before the court allowed their admission at trial. The court gave specific instructions to the jury during the trial and during its deliberations that the transcripts were only being received as aids and were not themselves to be considered evidence. Furthermore, during deliberations when the jury requested to be supplied with the tape transcripts, County Court complied with the request and at the same time specifically instructed that the tapes themselves would be made available to the jury. In fact, the jury subsequently acted upon this instruction by requesting to listen to one of the tapes. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by permitting the jury to use the tape transcripts as an aid during its deliberations (see, People v Kuss, 81 AD2d 427, 429-430).
Finally, defendant contends that his sentence of three concurrent terms of imprisonment of 8 Vs to 25 years was unduly harsh and excessive. "" '[T]he imposition of the sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we should not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances’ ” (People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838, quoting People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663). Defendant’s sentence was within the statutory parameters (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). The record shows that County Court properly exercised its discretion in considering the individual circumstances of defendant, a first-time offender, and the serious nature of the crimes committed (see, People v Pedraza, 66 NY2d 626, 627). We note that defendant was found guilty of three distinct criminal acts for which he could have been sentenced to consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment. We do not find this to be an appropriate case in which to exercise this Court’s discretion to modify the sentence in the interest of justice.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered April 12, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in two separate indictments with various drug-related crimes. He pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of both indictments and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to two concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4 to 8 years. Defendant now appeals.
Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the basis that there are no nonfiivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Upon reviewing the record, the parties’ briefs and defendant’s pro se submission, we agree. The record discloses that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea and waived all appeal rights, including any challenge to the severity of the sentence (see People v Riddick, 298 AD2d 710). Defendant’s assertions regarding a potential alibi and police corruption concern matters outside the record (see People v Kwiatkowski, 268 AD2d 681, 682, lv denied 94 NY2d 949). Therefore, the judgment is affirmed and defense counsel’s application is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633).

"—Appeals from two judgments of the County Court of Broome County (Monserrate, J.), rendered March 3, 1989, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted rape in the first degree.
Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that the sentences he received were harsh and excessive. We disagree. The 5- to 15-year prison sentence he received upon his guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was well within the statutory guidelines (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and the plea was made in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment. Furthermore, no promises were made to him with respect to the sentence he would receive for that crime. As to the IVi to 4Vi-year prison sentence he received for his conviction of attempted rape in the first degree, defendant not only received the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law § 70.02 [3] [b]; [4]), but he pleaded guilty to that crime knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed, including the fact that it would be consecutive to the sentence imposed for the drug conviction. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse by County Court in sentencing defendant (see, People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, 775, lv denied 75 NY2d 812; People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Vogt, J.), rendered December 5, 1988, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On this appeal defendant challenges his conviction on the ground that it is not supported by sufficient evidence, that County Court improperly denied defendant’s request for an intoxication charge and that the sentence imposed was excessive. In our view defendant’s arguments to reverse the conviction or to modify the sentence are without merit. The judgment of conviction should therefore be affirmed.
Defendant and others were charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree arising out of two separate sales of cocaine to undercover police officers, one on January 8, 1988 and the other on January 13, 1988. Defendant was acquitted of the January 8, 1988 charge and convicted of the January 13, 1988 charge (count 2 of the indictment). The underlying facts can be found in this court’s affirmance of the conviction of one of defendant’s codefendants (see, People v Solis, 173 AD2d 1089, lv denied 78 NY2d 974,1081).
Viewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the People, as we must (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the criminal activity charged in the second count of the indictment (see, People v Williams, 79 NY2d 803, affg on opn below 172 AD2d 448). The jury had before it evidence that defendant resided with the codefendants in the room where the sale occurred, was present on January 11, 1988 when arrangements for the January 13, 1988 sale were made and again at the time of the sale, and picked up and counted the purchase money after it was placed on a television by the undercover officer.
As to defendant’s second argument, there is insufficient evidence of defendant’s intoxication on January 13, 1988 to require an intoxication charge (see, People v Rodriguez, 76 NY2d 918, 920). Further, we do not find the prison sentence imposed of 3 to 9 years to be excessive. It was within the maximum authorized (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and defendant has failed to demonstrate that County Court abused its discretion or that extraordinary circumstances exist which would warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Robinson, 66 AD2d 903; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered March 17, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to a plea agreement that included a waiver of appeal. The plea satisfied a two-count indictment, which stemmed from the execution of a search warrant and discovery of cocaine in defendant’s possession. Defendant admitted his predicate felony conviction and County Court, as agreed, imposed a prison sentence of six years with three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal ensued.
As a threshold matter, we find that defendant’s waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see also People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Jackson, 129 AD3d 1342, 1342 [2015]). The record reflects that County Court adequately explained the right to appeal and that it was separate and distinct from the other rights automatically forfeited by defendant’s guilty plea, as well as the rights that were not forfeited by the appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Rubio, 133 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2015]). Defendant also executed a detailed written waiver in open court that described the scope of the rights being waived and acknowledged that he had sufficient time to discuss it with counsel, after County Court confirmed that he understood the written waiver of appeal and was freely and voluntarily signing it (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; see also People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 266-267 [2011]; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015]). Given defendant’s valid appeal waiver, his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is foreclosed (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d at 1038).
Defendant further contends that County Court erred when it refused his request, made for the first time at sentencing, for a sentence of parole supervision that included drug treatment, pursuant to Penal Law § 70.70 (3) (d) (see CPL 410.91). However, defendant received the sentence promised by the plea agreement—a six-year prison sentence with postrelease supervision—and that agreement did not include any promise by County Court to consider or recommend drug treatment as an alternative, discretionary sentence (see People v Brady, 122 AD3d 1009, 1010 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1160 [2015]; People v Patterson, 119 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1046 [2014]). In any event, County Court did not err in concluding that a drug treatment program would not be appropriate or warranted given defendant’s criminal history.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Hemmett, Jr., J.), rendered August 25, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant possessed a large quantity of cocaine and was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. An agreement was subsequently reached whereby defendant would plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony, and receive a sentence of 2 to 4 years in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services under the Willard Drug Treatment program in Seneca County. Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing. County Court, however, specifically advised him that if he did not appear for sentencing, he would not receive the promised sentence and he could be sentenced in absentia to the maximum for a class D felony. After defendant failed to appear for sentencing on four different occasions, County Court sentenced him in absentia as a second felony offender to 3x/2 to 7 years in prison. He now appeals.
We affirm. Given that defendant violated the terms of his release by repeatedly failing to appear for sentencing with full knowledge of the consequences thereof, County Court was justified in imposing the enhanced sentence. In view of this, as well as defendant’s prior criminal history, we do not find that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice or that County Court abused its discretion (see People v Ramsey, 269 AD2d 616, 617 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 951 [2000]; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, 880 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 879 [2000]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered March 29, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal. In accord with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to three years in prison, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we note that, although defendant waived his right to appeal, his waiver is invalid as he was not advised that the waiver was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 892-893 [2006]; People v Hill, 118 AD3d 1191, 1192 [2014]). Turning to his substantive contentions, defendant asserts that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Although defendant failed to preserve this claim by making an appropriate postal-locution motion (see People v Vandemark, 117 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]), we are required to examine further, as he argues that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was triggered by his statements in the course of the plea colloquy negating an essential element of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see People v Worden, 22 NY3d 982, 985 [2013]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Zabele, 53 AD3d 685, 686 [2008]).
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (see Penal Law § 220.34). During the plea allocution, he related that he was pleading guilty “under false pretenses” and stated, “I wasn’t selling nothing, I was bringing it to someone else.” County Court responded by advising defendant that “[t]he law defines a sale as any transfer, any giving, selling, transferring” and noted that “[i]t doesn’t have to be for money, it doesn’t have to be for anything of value” (see Penal Law § 220.00 [1]). Defendant thereafter replied that he was aware of this and, in response to further inquiry by the court, admitted that he had engaged in such conduct. Upon review, we find that the court’s further inquiries and defendant’s responses were adequate to dispel any doubt as to defendant’s understanding of the nature of the charge, and to ensure that his plea was intelligently entered (compare People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 678 [1999]). Thus, we find the exception inapplicable.
The record of defendant’s participation at both the plea proceeding and arraignment does not support his further contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney’s failure to request a CPL article 730 competency hearing. Defendant is presumed competent, and a history of mental illness and substance abuse does not necessarily rebut this presumption (see People v Bennett, 30 AD3d 631, 631 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 809 [2006]; People v Medina, 249 AD2d 694, 694 [1998]). No record evidence suggests that defense counsel’s decision was not “a sound defense strategy,” or that defendant was otherwise deprived of meaningful representation (People v Barclay, 1 AD3d 705, 707 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 567 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Defendant’s counsel ultimately negotiated a favorable plea agreement that substantially reduced his sentencing exposure (see People v Leszczynski, 96 AD3d 1162, 1162-1163 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 998 [2012]). The sentence was imposed in accord with that agreement and, considering defendant’s prior criminal history, we find his claim that it was harsh and excessive without merit (see People v Sherald, 45 AD3d 973 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 771 [2008]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered November 19, 1993, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree and resisting arrest.
As the result of a police raid on a crack house in the City of Albany, defendant was found guilty after a jury trial of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree and resisting arrest. She was sentenced to consecutive terms of one year in jail for each crime. Defendant contends that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive given her demonstrated commitment to rehabilitation and the care of her nine-year-old daughter. We agree.
The record reveals that, since her arrest, defendant has completed counseling classes and substance abuse programs, performed volunteer work and obtained employment. She has taken steps to establish a new lifestyle with her daughter. Recognizing defendant’s efforts, the presentence report recommended that she be put on probation, rather than sentenced to jail. Moreover, even the District Attorney has not objected to a reduction of defendant’s sentence. In view of these considerations, as well as the fact that defendant has already served almost 51/2 months in jail, we find that defendant’s sentence should in the interest of justice be reduced to time served (see, People v Todd GG., 196 AD2d 907; People v Board, 97 AD2d 610).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 14, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment and a pending assault charge. Prior to sentencing, defendant retained substitute counsel and moved to withdraw his plea, which County Court denied following an extensive inquiry. Sentenced as an admitted second felony offender to the agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 4x/2 to 9 years, defendant now appeals.
Initially, while defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea preserved some of the involuntariness claims now raised on appeal (see People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806, 807 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 686 [2001]), a review of the plea colloquy demonstrates that County Court fully apprised defendant of his rights and of the consequences of the plea; the court conducted a sufficient inquiry to establish that defendant understood the proceedings, had ample time to confer with counsel and consider the plea offer, and was entering the plea voluntarily (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Barnaby, 30 AD3d 775, 776 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]). Defendant was not required to recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual exposition, as it was sufficient that he provided unequivocal affirmative responses to the court’s questions, never made statements negating his guilt and indicated that he was entering the plea because he was, in fact, guilty (see People v Turner, 27 AD3d 962, 963 [2006]; see also People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]).
We find no basis to disturb County Court’s discretionary determination to deny defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780 [2005]; People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664-665 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002]; see also CPL 220.60 [3]; cf. People v D’Adamo, 281 AD2d 751, 752 [2001]). Defendant asserted that his plea was involuntary because he was not receiving prescription medicine for mental health problems at the time of his plea. However, as the court noted in reviewing the plea minutes, there was no indication at the time of the plea that defendant suffered any mental deficiency or inability to think clearly or to. understand the consequences of and voluntarily enter a guilty plea (see People v Criscitello, 32 AD3d 1112, 1113-1114 [2006]; People v Hart, 205 AD2d 943 [1994]; see also People v D'Adamo, supra at 752). In response to the court’s plea inquiry, defendant stated that he was thinking clearly and had not taken any medication, never raising a concern about a lack of medicine. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea on this ground was based solely upon conclusory affidavits, unsupported by any medical proof, which did not raise a sufficient question of fact regarding the voluntariness of his plea so as to require an evidentiary hearing (see People v Alexander, 97 NY2d 482, 485-486 [2002]; People v Criscitello, supra at 1114; People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 631 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; cf. People v D'Adamo, supra).
Defendant also alleged that his plea had been induced by a false promise that the related charges against his fiancée would be dismissed if he accepted the plea deal. No such promise appears in the plea colloquy, and its existence is belied by his sworn assertion to County Court during the plea proceedings that no other promises had been made to induce his guilty plea. Defendant’s unsworn allegation that trial counsel had made such a promise to him when they conferred during the plea proceedings was unsupported by any evidence despite defendant having the assistance of substitute counsel and an adjournment to substantiate that claim (see People v De Fabritis, supra at 665).
Turning to defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record reflects that defendant received an advantageous plea to the lower level felony with a sentence commitment that was the minimum possible, and nothing in the record casts doubt upon counsel’s effectiveness (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Defendant’s assertion that trial counsel failed to discuss possible trial defenses is directly refuted by the plea colloquy (see People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]; People v Lahon, 17 AD3d 778, 779 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 790 [2005]).
Finally, defendant’s challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is unavailing, as he received the minimum permissible second felony offender term of imprisonment for this class B felony (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and, thus, there is no “legally authorized lesser sentence” (CPL 470.20 [6]; see People v Anderson, 268 AD2d 228, 229 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 792 [2000]). We do not find, as the People urge, that defendant effected a valid waiver of his right to appeal foreclosing his right to challenge the sentence’s severity, as there was only a fleeting reference to an appeal waiver in the plea allocution (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-10 [1989]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County, rendered June 30, 1976, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a mandatory maximum of life and a minimum of six years. Defendant’s principal contention on this appeal is that, because he disagreed with the prosecutor’s outline of his involvement in the crimes charged, the trial court erred in failing to inquire into the facts of the crime at the time of his guilty plea. An examination of the record discloses that the trial court questioned defendant thoroughly and was satisfied that he fully understood the consequences of changing his plea to guilty. The defendant admitted that he knew that he could receive a minimum sentence of 15 years upon conviction of the first count of the indictment. When asked by the court why he was pleading guilty, defendant replied that the guilty plea was to his benefit since it removed the possibility of a much longer minimum sentence imposable upon conviction of the first degree offense charged in the indictment. The trial court is not bound in every situation to catechize a defendant about his guilt. The record establishes that defendant was represented by retained competent counsel of his own choice and was fully aware of the effect of his plea (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338; People v Seaton, 19 NY2d 404; People v Fierro, 50 AD2d 1013). Defendant also raises a challenge to the composition of the jury panel. However, defendant by his voluntary plea with advice of counsel, waived his right to a trial by jury (Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238). He was given ample time to examine the permanent jury list when his trial was put over to the next term after his challenge to the jury panel was denied. Defendant failed to utilize this additional time but chose instead to plead guilty to the lesser offense. There is no merit to defendant’s remaining contention that article 220 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional since cocaine is ""a relatively harmless drug”. The Court of Appeals has held that the sentencing statutes under article 220 do not impose cruel and unusual punishment (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). Judgment affirmed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered September 30, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Waiving his right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, with the understanding that he would be sentenced to to 5 years in prison. At the time of the plea, County Court informed defendant that an enhanced sentence of SVa to 7 years in prison could be imposed if he did not abide by the conditions of the plea agreement, which included cooperating with the presentence investigation and appearing in court on the scheduled date of sentencing. Defendant admittedly failed to comply with those conditions and, thus, County Court sentenced him to an enhanced term of 3 to 6 years in prison. The court also informed defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal did not bar a challenge to his sentence. Defendant now appeals, challenging the imposition of the enhanced sentence.
Inasmuch as the conditions of the plea agreement—which de fendant admittedly violated—did not contravene statutory provisions or public policy, and County Court informed defendant during the plea colloquy of the maximum potential sentence for noncompliance with the conditions, we cannot say that the court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence (see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Terrell, 41 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2007]; see also People v Hicks, 98 NY2d 185, 188-189 [2002]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered December 19, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was found to be in possession of more than four ounces of cocaine and was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of eight years to life. On appeal, defendant contends that the waiver of his right to appeal, which was made part of his guilty plea, was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that County Court did not enter into a meaningful colloquy on the record to ascertain that it was. He also argues that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Initially, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that the waiver was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that County Court did not enter into a meaningful colloquy (see, People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769; People v Catalfamo, 228 AD2d 786, 787-788; People v Hendrickson, 227 AD2d 801; cf., People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283). The record reveals that defendant signed a written waiver of his right to appeal which stated that he gave up his right to appeal issues relating to his conviction and sentence and that the waiver was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently executed. In addition, during the plea allocution, County Court advised defendant of the many rights he would be relinquishing by pleading guilty. The court specifically ddvised defendant that he would be waiving his appeal rights as this was a condition requested by the District Attorney as part of the plea bargain. Defendant responded on the record that he understood the court’s admonitions, that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily and that he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation. In view of this, defendant’s guilty plea and the waiver of his right to appeal must be enforced (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1).
Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of defendant’s challenge to the sentence imposed, we would not find it to be harsh or excessive. Defendant was a second felony offender with a history of prior drug-related convictions. In view of this, as well as the fact that the sentence was agreed to by defendant as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb it (see, People v Minshell, 196 AD2d 911, lv denied 82 NY2d 851; People v Albert, 195 AD2d 893, lv denied 82 NY2d 890).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered September 11, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to seven years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He was sentenced accordingly and now appeals.
Defendant contends that he should not have been sentenced as a second felony offender because County Court did not give him the opportunity to contest the allegations contained in the prior felony information in violation of CPL 400.21 (3). Defendant has not preserved this claim for our review as he failed to raise an objection at sentencing (see People v Deschaine, 116 AD3d 1303, 1303 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1019 [2014]; People v Morse, 111 AD3d 1161, 1161 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered May 8, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In July 1999, defendant was indicted on one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In March 2000, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty, which was accepted in full satisfaction of that indictment, as well as a second indictment charging him with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In April 2000, defendant made a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and coercion by his attorney. After the appointment of new counsel, defendant’s motion was denied and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we note that “[t]he question of whether to permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the sound discretion of the trial court * * * and absent a showing of abuse, that court’s determination will not be disturbed” (People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746, 747). Upon our review of the record, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion. The transcript of the plea allocution demonstrates that the court engaged in a detailed colloquy with defendant and ascertained that he understood the ramifications of his plea and that he did, in fact, commit the crime at issue (see, People v Dawson, 278 AD2d 665, 667-668, lv denied 96 NY2d 799; People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711).
Defendant’s contention that the plea allocution was deficient because he failed to admit knowledge of the specific location of the drugs inside the apartment is unpersuasive. Defendant acknowledged that he brought the drugs to the apartment and that he retained control over them even though he had given them to his cousin to hold. In response to questioning by County Court, defendant unequivocally admitted to the knowing possession of the drugs with the intent to sell them. Under the circumstances presented, we find that “defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea following a sufficient inquiry by County Court, during which time defendant admitted his guilt to the requisite elements of the crime [] charged” (People v Dove, 236 AD2d 644, 644; see, Penal Law § 220.16 [1]).
Similarly, we find defendant’s contentions regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel to be without merit, as the record establishes that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Defendant’s attorney made appropriate motions and successfully negotiated a very favorable plea, resulting in the dismissal of the companion indictment and the imposition of the minimum possible sentence on the possession charge (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404; People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710, 711; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850). Furthermore, defense counsel’s failure to notify the People that defendant wished to testify before the grand jury does not, by itself, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872, 873; People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819, 820). We find defendant’s conclusory allegation that this failure “may have impacted [his] ability to present a viable defense” to be insufficient to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (see, People v Galleria, 264 AD2d 899, 900, lv denied 94 NY2d 880).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered March 28, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After a search of his home revealed large quantities of cocaine and cash, defendant was charged in a felony complaint with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. He thereafter waived indictment and pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a superior court information. As a condition of the guilty plea, defendant waived his right to appeal, orally and in writing, and agreed to a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years. At the sentencing hearing, however, defendant moved to withdraw the plea on grounds that the agreed-upon sentence was inappropriate and that his guilty plea was coerced. Defense counsel opposed the withdrawal but supported the motion to the extent that it sought a reduction in defendant’s sentence. County Court denied the motion and imposed the agreed-upon sentence, prompting this appeal by defendant.
We reject defendant’s contention that he was coerced into waiving his right to appeal. Our review of the record reveals that during the plea allocution defendant expressed his understanding of the waiver and denied that his consent to the terms of the plea agreement was procured by promise or force (see, People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 683-684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852; People v Brown, 239 AD2d 784, lv denied 91 NY2d 870). Moreover, defendant executed a written waiver of appeal that explained the scope of the waiver and that, after consulting with his attorney, he was waiving his right to appeal “ Voluntarily, knowingly, and without coercion’ ” (People v Harris [Bags], 242 AD2d 782, lvs denied 91 NY2d 1004, 1008). Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant effectively waived his right to appeal, notwithstanding that he refused to reaffirm the waiver at sentencing (see, People v Marrero, 242 AD2d 800). We therefore decline to review defendant’s claim that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered September 13, 2011, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in Washington County in January 2010. Five months later, in June 2010, he was arrested for possession of over 22 ounces of cocaine in Albany County and charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant then entered into a plea bargain on the Albany County charges and agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with a jail sentence of one year. After entering his plea in Albany County, but before sentencing, he pleaded guilty to the charge in Washington County and received a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision. When defendant later appeared for sentencing in Albany County, County Court indicated that it had not been aware of the prior arrest in Washington County and refused to sentence him as originally agreed. Defendant rejected a new offer of two years of imprisonment, and he was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. After a jury trial, he was found guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and County Court sentenced him to a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed in Washington County.
Defendant appeals, arguing that he is entitled to specific performance of his plea agreement in Albany County because he had detrimentally relied upon it when he entered into his Washington County plea bargain. We are unpersuaded. Defendant did not make this argument when he appeared for sentencing on his Albany County plea agreement. Moreover, in the absence of any indication in the record that County Court considered the Washington County charge as part of the Albany County plea agreement, the court was entitled to rely on the new information in determining that it was unwilling to abide by the agreement and, therefore, defendant was appropriately restored to the status quo upon withdrawal of his plea (see People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340, 348 [1980]; People v Bonville, 69 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2010]; People v Brooks, 284 AD2d 796, 797-798 [2001]; see also People v Walker, 187 AD2d 909, 909 [1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 796 [1993]).
Further, we do not find that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh or excessive. Although defendant points out that his criminal history is limited to the two 2010 arrests, County Court took this factor into consideration in determining that a maximum sentence was not warranted (see People v Williams, 65 AD3d 1423, 1424 [2009]). Nor do we find that defendant’s claimed substance abuse problems rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances (see People v Potter, 54 AD3d 444, 445 [2008]; People v May, 301 AD2d 784, 786 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 564 [2003]). In the absence of such circumstances, we decline to disturb County Court’s exercise of its discretion in imposing the sentence.

The facts adduced at trial raised three potential defenses— entrapment, duress, and agency. The Supreme Court properly denied the request to charge duress on the ground that the defendant had only testified to some implied threats. The entrapment defense was charged. Although defense counsel neither requested an agency charge nor objected to the court’s failure to so charge, the defendant asks that we now exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction and remit this case for a new trial for failure to charge the agency defense (see, CPL 470.15 [3] [c]; [6] [a]). Under the circumstances of this case, we decline to so exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction (cf., People v Oliver, 99 AD2d 789). Had an agency charge been requested, the facts in this case would have warranted the giving of such a charge (see, People v Roche, 45 NY2d 78, cert denied 439 US 958; but see, People v Herring, 83 NY2d 780). However, on the basis of the record before us, we cannot say that the failure to request an agency charge was not a tactical decision.
The sentence imposed is excessive to the extent indicated. Balletta, J. P., Rosenblatt, Ritter and Altman, JJ., concur.",,489,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J.), rendered December 5, 2007, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the negotiated plea agreement, sentencing was adjourned for one year to give defendant an opportunity to complete a long-term residential substance abuse program. If defendant completed the program, she was to be sentenced to time served and five years of probation. It was also understood that if defendant failed to complete the program, she could be sentenced to 5% years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision.
After defendant failed to complete the program, she was found to be in violation of her plea agreement and was sentenced to 51/2 years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision and ordered to pay restitution. On appeal to this Court, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the matter was remitted to County Court on the grounds that the inclusion of restitution, which was not part of the negotiated plea agreement, enhanced defendant’s sentence and defendant should have been afforded an opportunity to either withdraw her plea or accept the enhanced sentence (45 AD3d 1187, 1188 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 769 [2008]). In remitting the matter, we directed that defendant either be afforded the opportunity to withdraw her plea or accept the sentence that included the restitution, or, alternatively, County Court could resentence her pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement (id.). Upon remittal, defendant moved to withdraw her plea prior to resentencing. County Court denied the motion and thereafter sentenced her pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying her motion to withdraw her plea is without merit. Whether a defendant shall be permitted to withdraw a guilty plea rests in the discretion of the trial court and a plea may generally not be withdrawn “absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement” (People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940 [1998]; accord People v Zakrzewski, 7 AD3d 881, 881 [2004]). In raising the instant motion, defendant failed to present any grounds in support of withdrawing her plea. Moreover, a review of the record reveals that defendant had expressed no dissatisfaction with her plea in the 16 months between the entering of her plea and her motion. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the motion was properly denied (see People v Darling, 183 AD2d 950, 952-953 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 902 [1992]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered September 10, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of 3/2 years to be followed by an undisclosed period of postrelease supervision. Following his plea, defendant failed to appear at sentencing and County Court issued a bench warrant. Thereafter, defendant was apprehended and sentenced to a prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We reverse. “[A] defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action” (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]). Further, “[i]n order to satisfy the demands of due process, a defendant must be aware of not only the existence of the postrelease supervision component to a sentence, but also the promised or potential duration of that component if a negotiated sentence is a part of the plea agreement” (People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010]; see People v Miller, 62 AD3d 1047, 1048 [2009]). Here, defendant contends and the People concede that, although a negotiated sentence was a part of the plea agreement, defendant was not properly advised of the specific duration of mandatory postrelease supervision prior to his sentencing. Accordingly, the plea must be vacated and the judgment of conviction must be reversed (see People v Miller, 62 AD3d at 1048; People v Rivera, 51 AD3d 1267, 1270 [2008]).
In light of our holding, defendant’s remaining argument has been rendered academic.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered November 28, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and tampering with physical evidence.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and tampering with physical evidence, with no promise or recommendation regarding his sentence. County Court sentenced him on the criminal possession convictions to concurrent prison terms of eight years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and imposed a 1V.3 to 4-year prison term for the tampering with physical evidence conviction, to run consecutively to the other sentences. Defendant appeals.
By pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his claims of ineffec tive assistance of counsel, as none of his allegations of ineffectiveness directly affected the plea bargaining process (see People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Straight, 106 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2013]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]). Although defendant contends that counsel failed to review the presentence investigation report with him, counsel stated that he had reviewed it and he addressed that report at sentencing. Defendant spoke at sentencing and did not complain that he had been prevented from reviewing that report, rendering this claim unpreserved (see People v Stacchini, 108 AD3d 866, 867 [2013]).
The sentence imposed by County Court was lawful. Given defendant’s criminal record, the court’s disbelief regarding his contention that he was merely a user and not a seller of drugs, and his actions in trying to eat cocaine and dump it on the floor of the police station to destroy evidence, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction of his sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Souffrant, 104 AD3d 992, 993 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1010 [2013]).

We reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received of five years to life was harsh and excessive. Defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony. The plea was to a reduced charge in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment which included a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony. In addition, the sentence imposed was well within the statutory parameters and was in accordance with the plea agreement. Under the circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered November 22, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted by a Grand Jury on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree involving the sale of crack cocaine in the City of Binghamton, Broome County, on July 1, 1999. Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to the agreed-upon indeterminate prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals.
On appeal defendant claims that his prior felony conviction was not properly admitted into the record (see, CPL 400.21), that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that his sentence is unconstitutional and that County Court erred in sentencing him without ordering a presentence report (see, CPL 390.20 [1]). We find no merit to any of defendant’s claims and affirm his judgment of conviction.
Initially, the record reflects that County Court received a CPL 400.21 statement from the People reciting defendant’s conviction for robbery in the third degree and reviewed the allegations in that statement with defendant who thereafter admitted through his attorney that he had been legally convicted of that crime. We find that this provided defendant with sufficient notice and an opportunity to controvert the allegations in that statement (see, People v Chrysler, 260 AD2d 945, 945-946; see also, People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142) and does not vitiate defendant’s conviction as a second felony offender.
Next, defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not previously raised by a motion to withdraw defendant’s plea or to vacate his conviction and thus it is not preserved for our review (see, People v Knoblauch, 275 AD2d 477) and the record reveals nothing which would cause us to invoke an exception to the preservation doctrine (see, People v Alicea, 264 AD2d 900, 901, lv denied 94 NY2d 876).
Defendant’s claim that his sentence is unconstitutional because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment was also raised for the first time on this appeal and is not preserved for our review (see, People v Harris, 198 AD2d 570, lv denied 82 NY2d 925). Nevertheless, defendant fails to point to any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant our interference with the negotiated sentence (see, People v Smith, 263 AD2d 676, 677, lv denied 93 NY2d 1027).
Finally, defendant claims that he was improperly sentenced because County Court did not have a presentence report as required by CPL 390.20 (1). Defendant was sentenced on the same day he entered his guilty plea. The record reflects that County Court stated, “I have the probation report and am prepared for sentencing.” Defendant did not object to proceeding with his sentencing and admits in his brief that there was a preplea report from the Probation Department. That document, entitled “Pre-Dispositional/Pre-Plea/Pre-Sentence Investigation Report,” contains sufficient information regarding defendant and the charged crime to meet the requirements for such reports set forth in CPL 390.30 (3). Given all these circumstances, we find that defendant’s sentencing was proper and shall not be disturbed.

The only issue defendant raises on this appeal is that the sentence he received, two concurrent prison terms of four years to life, is harsh and excessive. Although defendant did not receive the minimum sentence allowed by statute, he also did not receive the maximum sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]). Even more significant, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Under such circumstances, we reject defendant’s claim that the sentence he bargained for is harsh and excessive (see, People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816, 817).

"Appeal from a judgment of the"" County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered October 30, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging defendant with several crimes related to his role in a conspiracy to traffic and sell cocaine, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 3 to 9 years on the conspiracy count, a prison term of 8V2 years and postrelease supervision of five years on the controlled substance count, and a jail term of one year on the weapon possession count, all to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
We do not agree with the People that defendant executed a valid appeal waiver. The purported appeal waiver was not cited ás a term of the plea agreement as initially presented. While defendant stated during the plea colloquy that he understood such a waiver was included, he never indicated that he understood the meaning of the waiver itself, County Court made minimal efforts to explain the nature of it, and defendant did not indicate that he had discussed the issue with counsel. Accordingly, we cannot say that the appeal waiver was a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one (see People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1259-1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]).
As defendant’s appeal waiver is invalid, his argument that the sentence is harsh and excessive is properly before us; nevertheless, we reject it. The sentence imposed was within the range agreed to as part of the plea bargain, and we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction thereof given that defendant possessed substantial quantities of cocaine and was intimately involved in its preparation and distribution (see People v Richardson, 28 AD3d 1002, 1005 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 817 [2006]; People v Dolison, 23 AD3d 844, 845 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered January 2, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Defendant thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a prison term of eight years followed by three years of postrelease supervision, to be served concurrently with a sentence that had been imposed upon similar charges in Washington County. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant claims that defense counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to either request that defendant be sentenced nunc pro tunc to the date that the Washington County sentence was imposed or otherwise ensure that the conditional release dates of the concurrent sentences would be the same. Even assuming this issue impacts the voluntariness of defendant’s plea and, hence, survives the unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal, this issue is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Brown, 128 AD3d 1273, 1274 [2015]). To the extent that defendant’s contention amounts to a misunderstanding on his part at the time of sentencing that the conditional release dates for both sentences would be the same, this issue involves matters outside the record and, as such, is more properly addressed by motion pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Seminara, 53 AD2d 678, 678 [1976]).

In satisfaction of a superior court information and other uncharged drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. The plea agreement contained a joint recommendation by the prosecution and defense that defendant be sentenced to 2 to 6 years in prison. County Court reserved the right to sentence her to the maximum term of incarceration. The agreement also contained defendant’s written waiver of her right to appeal. The presentence investigation report recommended that defendant be sentenced to six months in jail to be followed by a period of probation. However, County Court sentenced her in accordance with the joint recommendation to 2 to 6 years in prison.
On appeal, defendant contends that County Court should have adhered to the recommendation contained in the presentence investigation report and that it abused its discretion by sentencing her to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Given defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea and waiver of the right to appeal, we decline to address this claim (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

Defendant’s claim that the SCI charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree was jurisdictionally defective survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver (see People v Brothers, 123 AD3d 1240, 1240 [2014]; People v Martinez, 106 AD3d 1379, 1379 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 957 [2013]). Here, the SCI erroneously denominated the crime charged as Penal Law § 220.16 (1), rather than Penal Law § 220.16 (12). Upon our review, however, we find that the record establishes that this was solely a typographical error as the facts alleged in the SCI made clear that the crime intended to be charged was Penal Law § 220.16 (12) (see People v Ashley, 89 AD3d 1283, 1285 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 955 [2012]; People v Sterling, 27 AD3d 950, 951-952 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 898 [2006]; People v Miller, 23 AD3d 699, 701 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 815 [2006]).
Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, to the extent that it implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea, survives his appeal waiver and has been properly preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Ramey, 123 AD3d 1290, 1290 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 953 [2015]; People v Cavallaro, 123 AD3d 1221, 1223 [2014]). Nevertheless, defendant’s specific claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are without support in the record. In this context, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Wares, 124 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [Apr. 21, 2015]; People v Ramey, 123 AD3d at 1290-1291). Here, the record discloses that defense counsel, among other things, secured a favorable plea deal for defendant and vociferously advocated against sentencing defendant as a second felony offender. Further, nothing in the record — from the commencement of his criminal case to the completion of his advantageous plea — casts doubt upon counsel’s effectiveness. Defendant’s claim that his counsel should have made various motions amounts to no more than second-guessing his counsel’s legitimate legal strategy given that such motions would likely have been denied as without merit (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712-713 [1998]; People v Wares, 124 AD3d at 1081; People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1241, 1242-1243 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 944 [2013]). Accordingly, we find that defendant received meaningful representation.
Defendant’s valid appeal waiver — which he does not take issue with on appeal — precludes his challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution (see People v Sihounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2015]; People v Devault, 124 AD3d 1140, 1141 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 989 [Apr. 22, 2015]), his claim of prosecutorial misconduct (see People v Debberman, 113 AD3d 929, 929 [2014]) and his assertion that his agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Hall, 125 AD3d 1095, 1097 [2015]; People v Campo, 125 AD3d 1058, 1059 [2015]).

"—Appeals from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered January 3, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted rape in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a superior court information and subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted rape in the first degree in satisfaction of a two- count indictment. On appeal, defendant contends that the consecutive prison sentences of lYa to 4 years and 3Ys to 10 years that he received upon his guilty pleas are harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was allowed to plead to a lesser offense in satisfaction of the superior court information and to one of two counts in satisfaction of the indictment. In addition, the sentences defendant received were less than the harshest possible. Further, defendant knew that he would receive the sentences ultimately imposed at the time of his plea in satisfaction of the indictment and declined to withdraw his guilty plea in satisfaction of the information at that time. In light of these facts, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Gonzalez, 178 AD2d 850, lv denied 79 NY2d 948; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered May 6, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with that agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals, challenging the sufficiency of his plea allocution, the voluntariness of his plea and the effectiveness of his counsel.
Defendant contends that his plea allocution was insufficient because he never recited the actions taken by him to establish the elements of the crime. Where, as here, there is an enforceable appeal waiver, operating in conjunction with a failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, our review is precluded (see People v Simmons, 24 AD3d 1018, 1019 [2005]; People v Briggs, 21 AD3d 652, 653 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 881 [2005]; People v Stubblefield, 18 AD3d 955, 955 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 795 [2005]). Moreover, if we consider defendant’s assertions, we would find them without merit. County Court’s questioning during the final plea allocution served to establish each element of the crime; none of defendant’s statements negated any essential element or cast doubt upon his guilt. For these reasons, the narrow exception to the preservation rule would not be applicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]).
As to the voluntariness of his plea, defendant also contends that the trial judge was biased since such judge recently presided over a Family Court matter where defendant was a party. However, he failed to make a motion for the judge’s recusal or otherwise raise the issue before County Court. Even though the claim is unpreserved for our review (see People v Rizzo, 5 AD3d 924, 925 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 646 [2004]; People v Lebron, 305 AD2d 799, 800 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 583 [2003]; People v Maxam, 301 AD2d 791, 793 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 617 [2003]), we note that “[a]bsent a legal disqualification under Judiciary Law § 14, a [t]rial |j]udge is the sole arbiter of recusal . . . [and a] court’s decision in this respect may not be overturned, unless it was an abuse of discretion” (People v Moreno, 70 NY2d 403, 405-406 [1987]; see People v Smith, 272 AD2d 679, 681 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 938 [2000]). As the record reveals no abuse of discretion and further indicates that defendant fully discussed the plea agreement with his attorney before accepting it, the claim is meritless.
To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacted his voluntary, intelligent, and knowing decision to accept the plea, it survives his waiver of appeal. Yet, without a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment, it is unpreserved; nothing in the record warrants an exception to the preservation doctrine (see People v Clifford, 295 AD2d 697, 698 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 709 [2002]). Were we to reach the issue in the interest of justice, we would find no merit (see People v Russo, 8 AD3d 903, 904 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 681 [2004]). “So long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation” (People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; see People v Henry, 95 NY2d 563, 565 [2000]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]), a defendant’s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel will have been met. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, his initial arraignment fully complied with CPL 210.15 (2); he was made aware of all of his pertinent rights, a plea of not guilty was entered on his behalf and the matter was adjourned for him to obtain counsel. Moreover, the record reflects that defendant discussed an agency defense with his counsel prior to the plea and the plea that counsel ultimately negotiated exposed defendant to a sentence which was substantially reduced from its maximum potential (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Accordingly, with the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requiring proof of less then meaningful representation, a mere disagreement with the strategy and tactics employed by counsel will not suffice (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 708 [1988]).
Finally, we find no abuse of discretion or any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant our modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Dedmon, 10 AD3d 738, 739 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 756 [2004]; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 872 [1999]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered September 18, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, the mandatory prison sentence he received of 15 years to life upon his plea of guilty to a class A-l felony does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of either the State or Federal Constitutions (see, NY Const, art I, § 5; US Const 8th Amend; People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert denied 423 US 950; People v Miranda, 155 AD2d 901, lv denied 75 NY2d 773). Furthermore, it cannot be said on the particular facts of this case that the statutory sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]) was unconstitutionally applied to defendant (see, People v Broadie, supra). The record shows, inter alia, that the amount of cocaine sold was substantial and that defendant was a willing participant (see, People v Marine, 162 AD2d 275). It should also be noted that the plea was in full satisfaction of a nine-count indictment and that the sentence was part of the negotiated plea (see, People v Moore, 141 AD2d 769).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered June 13, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and tampering with physical evidence.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and tampering with physical evidence with the understanding that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to 3 Vs years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on the first charge and 2 to 4 years in prison on the second charge, with the prison terms to run concurrently. On the original date of sentencing, County Court granted defendant’s request for a one-week furlough in order to allow him to spend time with his family, including his newborn child. In so doing, the court admonished defendant that his failure to appear for the newly-scheduled sentencing hearing could result in the imposition of the maximum sentence allowable by law. Despite that warning, defendant failed to appear for sentencing as directed and was eventually brought into court via a bench warrant. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to 6V2 years in prison (less than the maximum allowed) and three years of postrelease supervision for the attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction and 2 to 4 years in prison for the tampering with physical evidence conviction, with those sentences ordered to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant concedes that County Court was authorized to impose an enhanced sentence, yet asserts that the GVs-year sentence in connection with the attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Our review of the record reveals neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of any extraordinary circumstances justifying a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Favor, 49 AD3d 915, 916 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered April 12, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment related to the sale and possession of cocaine on three occasions, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced, as an admitted second felony offender, to the agreed-upon prison term of four years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s contention that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel is not preserved for our review as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Moses, 110 AD3d 1118, 1118 [2013]). In any event, “[i]t is well settled that, in the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Wares, 124 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [2015]). Counsel pursued appropriate pretrial motions and discovery, and ensured that the controlled substance lab reports, which reflected that the substances tested positive for the presence of cocaine, were received before proceeding with the plea agreement. Were this issue properly before us, we would find that the record reflects that defendant received meaningful representation (see id.). Any challenge to counsel’s preplea motion practice or discovery efforts was forfeited by defendant’s guilty plea (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]; People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013]). Finally, to the extent that defendant makes arguments addressed to matters outside the record, such as what counsel investigated, they are more properly raised in a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Brown, 125 AD3d 1049, 1050 [2015]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered November 13, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts).
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, a pending charge of violating probation and other pending charges, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to concurrent prison terms of 2V2 years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, ordered restitution and imposed a $1,000 fine for each offense. Defendant appeals.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, the record establishes that County Court separately addressed and explained the rights encompassed by the appeal waiver and then elicited from defendant that he understood and agreed to waive his right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Edie, 100 AD3d 1262, 1262 [2012]). As such, we find that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Santana, 95 AD3d 1503, 1503 [2012]). Furthermore, as the record reflects that defendant was informed during the plea colloquy that a fine up to $5,000 could be imposed as part of the sentence, the valid appeal waiver precludes defendant’s challenge to the severity of the fine imposed (see People v Campo, 125 AD3d 1058, 1059 [2015]; People v Oginski, 123 AD3d 1303, 1303 [2014]; see also People v Anderson, 99 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1009 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered April 22, 2005, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant, charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, pleaded guilty, as a second felony offender, to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement which included the waiver of a right to appeal. Defendant’s motion to withdraw her guilty plea, submitted on her behalf by a second assigned counsel after she expressed dissatisfaction with her original representation, was denied by County Court which subsequently imposed the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison. On this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court’s denial of her motion to withdraw her guilty plea was improper because, as a result of her mental condition, she did not enter into the plea knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. She likewise maintains that she was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
“The determination of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea lies within the sound discretion of the trial court” (People v Morris, 30 AD3d 632, 632 [2006] [citations omitted]). Notably, the denial of such a motion is not an abuse of discretion, despite defendant’s mental health condition, where the trial court has been aware of that condition throughout the proceedings and “conducts a thorough inquiry ... to establish that, despite those deficiencies, defendant understood the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea and the motion to withdraw is based upon defendant’s unsubstantiated claims of lack of comprehension” (People v D'Adamo, 281 AD2d 751, 752 [2001], lv denied 98 NY2d 730 [2002]).
Here, notwithstanding the submission by defendant of documentary evidence attesting to her treatment for bipolar disorder, a review of the record reveals that County Court had been apprised of defendant’s personal problems prior to its execution of a meticulous plea allocution, during which it acknowledged defendant’s earlier discomfort with the proposed plea agreement and repeatedly ascertained her willingness to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter into such. Furthermore, despite defendant’s protestations to the contrary, inasmuch as the record indicates that defense counsel competently protected her interests and, indeed, negotiated a very advantageous plea that she herself described as an “excellent offer,” she cannot be said to have been deprived of meaningful representation (see People v La Porte, 31 AD3d 800, 801 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered August 16, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and resisting arrest after a traffic stop revealed a quantity of cocaine in his vehicle. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. After County Court repeatedly adjourned further proceedings to allow defendant to seek new counsel and prepare a motion to withdraw his plea, it denied said motion and sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of IV2 to 3 years in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s principal contention on appeal is that his counsel was ineffective because, by failing to prepare for trial, he left defendant with no choice but to enter an involuntary guilty plea. Our review of the plea minutes, in which defendant unequivocally recited the facts of his crime and assured County Court that he had spoken to his counsel, was satisfied with his services and was entering the plea of his own free will and with a full understanding of its consequences, belies this contention. Moreover, the record reveals that defendant’s attorneys were active in defendant’s case and procured for him an advantageous plea agreement which reduced his sentencing exposure. Accordingly, we perceive no basis for concluding that defendant did not receive meaningful representation (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Lewis, 13 AD3d 810, 811 [2004]). Defendant’s remaining arguments in his pro se submission concerning, among other things, the propriety of the traffic stop and the severity of his sentence, have been forfeited by his knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal and we decline to review them under the circumstances (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 586, 633 [2003]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (Charde, J.), rendered July 30, 1986, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to a indeterminate term of five-years-to-life imprisonment.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Orange County for (1) a hearing to specifically determine whether the State Police were of the view that the defendant had materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations and (2) resentencing of the defendant based on that determination.
The defendant was indicted for several crimes relating to the sale and possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter, the defendant and the People completed a plea bargain. As part of the plea bargain, the People agreed that (1) based on the plea, the range of sentence would be from ""a minimum of three to life, to a maximum of eight and a third to life” and (2) they would recommend a sentence of three years to life if the “subjective determination” of the State Police was that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations.
Prior to sentencing, New York State Police Investigator Duffy, with whom the defendant was working, prepared a ""list of activities” that the defendant had engaged in, “acting as a cooperating individual with the N.Y.S.P.”
At sentencing, the defendant’s counsel alerted the court that he had spoken to Duffy and was advised by the latter that the defendant had cooperated ""two hundred percent” with the State Police. In opposition, the People argued that (1) the promise of three years to life was conditioned on the State Police being satisfied that the defendant actually delivered those ""quality dealers that he claimed he could deliver” and (2) the defendant had not so delivered. The sentencing court accepted the People’s version of the plea bargain, and sentenced the defendant to a term of five years to life.
We disagree with the sentencing court’s determination. The on-the-record plea bargain indicates that a sentence of three years to life would be imposed upon the defendant if the State Police, in their subjective determination, were of the view that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations. There is nothing on the plea bargain record which obligated the defendant to deliver so-called ""quality dealers” or actually produce controlled buys and sales resulting in arrests. Nevertheless, the record is insufficient to determine whether the State Police, in their subjective determination, were of the view that the defendant materially complied and cooperated with them on drug investigations. Accordingly, the defendant’s sentence must be vacated and a hearing on this issue conducted (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 239; Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57; People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340). After a resolution of this issue, the defendant should be appropriately resentenced. Mangano, J.

"—Carpinello, J.
Defendant was found to be in possession of marihuana while incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was subsequently charged with promoting prison contraband in the first degree and unlawful possession of marihuana. Thereafter, he moved, inter alia, to dismiss that count of the indictment charging him with promoting prison contraband in the first degree or, alternatively, to reduce the charge to promoting prison contraband in the second degree. Following County Court’s denial of the motion, defendant pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 3 to 6 years in prison consecutive to the sentence he was then serving. Defendant appeals.
Initially, Penal Law § 205.25 provides that:
“A person is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree when: * * *
“2. Being a person confined in a detention facility, he knowingly and unlawfully makes, obtains or possesses any dangerous contraband.”
Defendant argues that because marihuana is not “dangerous contraband” within the meaning of Penal Law § 205.00 (4), the charge of promoting prison contraband in the first degree should have been reduced to promoting prison contraband in the second degree. We disagree. Penal Law § 205.00 (4) broadly defines dangerous contraband as any item capable of “endanger [ing] the safety or security of a detention facility or any person therein.” More than one appellate court has recognized that the use of illegal drugs by inmates in correctional facilities “can result in disruptive and dangerous behavior among the inmate population,” thus providing a basis for the charge of promoting prison contraband in the first degree (People v Watson, 162 AD2d 1015, 1015, appeal dismissed 77 NY2d 857; see People v Rivera, 221 AD2d 380, Iv denied 87 NY2d 977). In light of these appellate decisions, defendant’s reliance on People v Soto (77 Misc 2d 427) is misplaced. We have considered defendant’s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we find no error in the denial of defendant’s motion.

"Levine, J.
Defendant was indicted on a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. While this charge was pending, defendant sought treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse and successfully completed several programs. Defendant thereafter accepted a plea agreement which permitted him to enter a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class C felony, with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years’ imprisonment.
At sentencing, defense counsel asked County Court to consider imposing a more lenient sentence in light of defendant’s significant progress in conquering his problems with substance abuse. Defense counsel submitted a memorandum detailing the course of treatment defendant pursued following his arrest and also a favorable report from defendant’s employer. In addition, the presentence report recommended that defendant be sentenced to a six-month term of incarceration and an appropriate term of probation. County Court, however, declined to deviate from the negotiated plea agreement and this appeal by defendant ensued.
On appeal, defendant claims that County Court did not exercise its discretion in sentencing defendant because it erroneously considered itself bound to adhere to the terms of the plea agreement (citing, inter alia, People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822). In our view, however, the transcript of the sentencing hearing indicates that County Court recognized that it retained discretion in sentencing defendant, but chose not to deviate from the agreed upon term of imprisonment.
We also reject defendant’s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was well aware of defendant’s efforts at rehabilitation and we cannot agree that the court’s decision to impose a sentence consistent with the terms of the plea agreement constituted an abuse of discretion (see, People v Smith, 154 AD2d 840; People v Lewis, 116 AD2d 778, 779).

"Mikoll, J. P.
Appeal from an order of the County Court of Sullivan County (Leaman, J.), entered June 12, 1996, which denied defendant’s application for permission to inspect Grand Jury minutes.
Defendant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. In connection with the appeal of that convic tion, defendant requested a copy of the Grand Jury minutes underlying his indictment. County Court denied the request and defendant has appealed from that order.
We affirm. The apparent basis for defendant’s request was the alleged insufficiency of the evidence before the Grand Jury. Defendant’s plea of guilty, however, waived any question as to the sufficiency of the proof supporting the indictment (see, People v Alfone, 132 AD2d 878, lv denied 70 NY2d 797; People v Ector, 126 AD2d 904). Even if it is accepted that he was also challenging defects in the Grand Jury proceeding itself, which is not waived by a guilty plea (see, People v Wilkins, 68 NY2d 269, 277, n 7), defendant’s allegations fail to show the ""compelling and particularized need for access” that is required before access to Grand Jury minutes may be obtained (Matter of Hudson v Albany County Grand Jury, 165 AD2d 966, 967).

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment with the understanding that the People would recommend a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing. Upon being rearrested for a drug-related crime two years later, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 7V2 to 15 years. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that his sentence was excessive in light of his health problems and his mother’s terminal illness. We disagree.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Murphy, J.), rendered March 2, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted pursuant to a superior court information charging him with one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. A plea agreement was reached, pursuant to the terms of which defendant agreed to plead guilty to the superior court information with the understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of four years followed by a period of postrelease supervision ranging from IV2 to 3 years. The plea agreement, which also would satisfy additional charges, required defendant to waive his right to appeal. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the charged crime and was sentenced to a prison term of four years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Upon appeal, defendant argues only that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive.

In 2002, defendant was charged in two indictments with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (seven counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (seven counts). Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictments, and was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison. Approximately eight years later, defendant moved pursuant to CEL 440.10 to vacate his judgment of conviction on the ground that his attorney failed to advise him of the deportation consequences of his plea. With the Eeople’s consent, County Court vacated defendant’s judgment of conviction. At the same time, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, in full satisfaction of the two indictments, and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, in accord with the terms of the plea agreement, to 3 to 9 years in prison. This appeal ensued.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered March 18, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, as a second felony offender to a prison term of 31/a to 7 years. Defendant, claiming that he did not waive his right to appeal his sentence, contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive given, inter alia, the strides he has made with his substance abuse problem. Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal included his waiver to appeal the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909; People v Spanos, 224 AD2d 732, 733; People v Burk, 181 AD2d 74, lv denied 80 NY2d 927). In any event, were we to consider the merits of defendant’s assertion that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we would find that the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion to warrant modification of the sentence imposed by County Court, especially in light of defendant’s extensive criminal history (see, People v Spanos, supra; People v Henry, 222 AD2d 932, 936, lv denied 88 NY2d 848).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered February 25, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
A grand jury indicted defendant on the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, both class B felonies. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony, in satisfaction of the indictment, two pending violation of probation petitions, and any potential narcotics charges arising from incidents which occurred in the periods three months before and after the date of the allegations in the indictment. No sentence was recommended. The plea included a waiver of the right to appeal, except as to the sentence. County Court sentenced defendant to a term of two to six years’ incarceration.
Defendant’s arguments concerning the voluntariness of his plea and ineffectiveness of counsel are not preserved for our review because he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]; People v King, 299 AD2d 661 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]). His sentence is not harsh or excessive. It is moderate considering defendant’s criminal history, his exposure to two concurrent terms of 8⅓ to 25 years on the original charges, plus the dismissal of the probation violation petitions and waiver of other potential charges (see People v Sczepankowski, 293 AD2d 212, 215-216 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 564 [2002]).

"Appeals by defendant from (1) a judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County, rendered May 17,1978, convicting him of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing concurrent sentences of imprisonment of three years to life; and (2) (by permission) an order of the same court, dated September 25, 1979, denying his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (subd 1) to vacate the said judgment. Judgment modified, on the law, by reducing the sentences to two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of one year to life. As so modified, judgment affirmed. Order reversed, on the law, and case remitted to Criminal Term for a hearing and further proceedings consistent herewith. Defendant was previously convicted of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of one year to life. That judgment was reversed (People v Simone, 59 AD2d 918). Following the retrial, defendant was convicted of the same charges and was sentenced to concurrent terms of three years to life. In the absence of objective information appearing affirmatively on the record concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing which would justify the imposition of a harsher sentence, it was error for the court to have imposed a greater sentence following the retrial (see North Carolina v Pearce, 395 US 711, 726; People v Yannicelli, 47 AD2d 911, mod 40 NY2d 598). Additionally, under the circumstances here presented, a hearing should be held on defendant’s application to vacate the judgment.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County, rendered January 13, 1978, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. On the court’s own motion, the appeal is deemed to be from the judgment as amended by a resentencing of the defendant on September 26, 1979 pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law. Amended judgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence. As so modified amended judgment affirmed and the case is remanded to Criminal Term for further proceedings consistent herewith. Prior to the entry of the defendant’s guilty plea, the court expressed its intention to impose a sentence of from one year to life imprisonment on the count of the indictment charging the defendant with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The court assured the defendant that if that sentence could not be imposed he would be permitted to withdraw his plea. Thereafter, without offering the defendant the promised opportunity to withdraw his plea, the court sentenced him to a term of one and one-half years to life imprisonment. Neither the defendant nor his attorney objected to the sentence as imposed. Subsequently, the defendant’s sentence was modified pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law, and he was resentenced to a term of from one and one-half to four and one-half years in prison. In our view, the court’s failure to fulfill the plea agreement requires a modification. A defendant must be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea where it was induced by a sentencing promise which the court is unable or unwilling to fulfill. (See, e.g., People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert den 419 US 1122; People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751.) The defendant’s failure to object or to remind the court of a plea agreement does not constitute a waiver of his right to withdraw his plea rather than accept a sentence greater than the one promised him by the court. (See People v Esposito, 32 NY2d 921; People v Glasby, 44 AD2d 541.) Under the circumstances at bar, and in view of the defendant’s resentencing, we deem it an appropriate remedy to vacate the defendant’s sentence and to remand the case to Criminal Term with a direction to resentence the defendant by (1) imposing the promised minimum term of one year, and (2) fixing an appropriate maximum term pursuant to section 60.09 of the Penal Law.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Beerman, J.), rendered December 17, 1990, convicting him of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
As part of a negotiated plea bargain, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive a sentence of five years to life imprisonment. The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law §§ 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally-low term of imprisonment for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed upon sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment. On appeal, both parties agree that the conviction should be reduced to a crime of a lesser degree in order to effectuate the plea agreement.
Under the circumstances, the judgment should be modified, in the interests of justice, by reducing the conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law § 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489; cf., People v Monereau, 181 AD2d 918; People v Alvarez, 166 AD2d 603). We note that since the sentence imposed upon the defendant’s plea was the sentence promised, no purpose would be served by remitting the matter for resentencing (see, People v Brown, supra; People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743).
We find that the sentence imposed was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Mangano, P.

"Judgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed and matter remitted to Jefferson County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following Memorandum: Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree in satisfaction of a four-count indictment and was sentenced to a term of probation of five years and directed to pay restitution in the amount of $2,517.92. Although the plea agreement provided for restitution, no amount appears in the record of the plea colloquy. Defendant stated at sentencing that the amount in the presentence report, which has not been furnished on appeal, exceeded the amount discussed at the time of the plea.
Where, as here, there was no proof before County Court concerning the loss sustained, the court should have held a hearing to determine the proper amount of restitution (see, Penal Law § 60.27 [2]; People v Millar, 144 AD2d 1032). Although defendant by his plea consented to the restitution provision and he failed to request a hearing at the time of sentencing, defendant is nevertheless entitled to a restitution hearing because of the “ ‘essential nature’ of the right to be sentenced as provided by law” (People v Fuller, 57 NY2d 152, 156; see, People v Bentivegna, 145 AD2d 899, 899-900).

"—Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: Upon his plea of guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to concurrent indeterminate terms of 4½ to 9 years. He contends that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was improperly induced by County Court’s threat of a heavier sentence if he were found guilty after trial. He further contends that there was an insufficient factual basis for the plea and that the court erred in accepting the plea without first determining whether defendant was aware of possible defenses. By failing to move to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to CPL 220.60 (3) or to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10, defendant failed to preserve those contentions for our review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666; People v Garrow [appeal No. 1], 233 AD2d 856, lv denied 89 NY2d 942; People v Rice [appeal No. 2], 224 AD2d 972, lv denied 88 NY2d 883; People v Coleman, 203 AD2d 729, 730). Were we to consider those contentions, we would conclude that they are lacking in merit and unsupported by the record. Although defendant initially was reluctant to admit any of the underlying facts, the court refused to accept his guilty plea unless defendant admitted that he had sold cocaine in the City of Geneva on the two days enumerated in the indictment (see, People v Lowe, 149 AD2d 939, 940, lv denied 74 NY2d 743).

"Appeal by the People from a sentence of the County Court, Rockland County (Resnik, J.), imposed June 7, 2005, upon the defendant’s conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, the sentence being a determinate term of imprisonment of one year, to be followed by a two-year period of postrelease supervision.
Ordered that sentence is reversed, on the law, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, for further proceedings consistent herewith.
On March 31, 2005, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, based on conduct which occurred on July 13, 2004. In exchange for the plea, over the People’s objection, the defendant was promised that he would be sentenced under the Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738) (hereinafter the DLRA) to a determinate term of imprisonment of one year, to be followed by a two-year period of post-release supervision. The defendant was sentenced as promised on June 7, 2005, and the People appeal.
The defendant committed the instant crime before the January 13, 2005, effective date of the DLRA. Thus, he was not entitled to be sentenced under the DLRA, and the bargained-for sentence imposed upon the defendant’s conviction was illegal. The sentence therefore must be reversed (see L 2004, ch 738; Penal Law § 70.00 [2], [2] [b], [3], [3] [b]; People v Goode, 25 AD3d 723 [2006]).
Since the defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive a sentence which was illegal, the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, to give the defendant the option of either withdrawing his plea or receiving a legal sentence (see People v Dabbs, 280 AD2d 611 [2001]; People v Ruiz, 226 AD2d 747, 748 [1996]).

"—Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Tomei, J.), both rendered October 31, 1983, convicting him of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his pleas of guilty, and sentencing him to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 41/2 years to 9 years.
Judgments affirmed.
On these appeals, the defendant contends that his pleas of guilty should be vacated because he was not advised at the taking of the pleas of his “rights to testify in his own behalf and have the People prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury”. Having failed either to move to withdraw his plea on this ground prior to the imposition of sentence or to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, the defendant has not preserved, for appellate review the plea allocution’s sufficiency (see CPL 470.05, subd 2; People v Hoke, 62 NY2d 1022; People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Mattocks, 100 AD2d 944). Moreover, were we to review this issue in the interest of justice, vacatur would not be required because the allocution satisfied the requirements of People v Harris (61 NY2d 9).
With regard to the defendant’s contention that the second felony offender statute (see Penal Law, § 70.06) is unconstitutional, we note that this issue, too, has not been preserved for our review (see People v Cates, 104 AD2d 895). In any event, this identical issue has previously been rejected (see People v Thompson, 105 AD2d 762; People v Rembert, 105 AD2d 717; People v Vasquez, 104 AD2d 1012; People v Cates, supra), and no reason to depart from these rulings has been proffered to us by the defendant. Similarly any claim that the sentence imposed is disproportionate to the crimes for which the defendant stands convicted must be rejected under the circumstances presented herein (see United States v Ortiz, 742 F2d 712).
Finally, there is no merit to the defendant’s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The defendant received the bargained-for sentence (see People v La Lande, 104 AD2d 1052; People v Nelson, 104 AD2d 1055; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816), which was the minimum allowed by law (Penal Law, § 70.06, subd 3, par [b]; subd 4, par [b]).

"Four judgments of the County Court, Nassau County, each rendered June 22, 1967 upon defendant’s plea of guilty, modified, on the law, by deferring imprisonment thereunder until termination of the sentence imposed by the District Court, Nassau County, on April 21, 1967, at which time defendant will be required to serve the sentences now under review in full, with due credit for time already served, as indicated herein. As so modified, judgments affirmed. No questions of fact were considered on this appeal. On April 21, 1967 the District Court, Nassau County, sentenced defendant to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission for misdemeanors committed after April 1, 1967, and made an order of certification. (Cf. Mental Hygiene Law, §§ 207, 208.) He was placed in a rehabilitation or treatment center and was thereafter brought to the County Court, Nassau County, where on May 11, 1967 he withdrew his pleas of not guilty to four 1966 indictments and pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a narcotic drug as a felony under one of the indictments and to petit larceny under each of the other three indictments. On June 22, 1967 he appeared for sentence and objected to the imposition thereof on the ground that it would improperly interrupt his sentence to the custody of the Commission and would frustrate the rehabilitation program set up by the Mental Hygiene Law. The court imposed the sentences now under review, namely, a term of 1% to 5 years for the felony and a term of one year for each petit larceny. All sentences were concurrent, and execution of the misdemeanor sentences was suspended, defendant being placed on probation for three years. He is presently incarcerated under the sentence for the felony. In a criminal action the sentence is the judgment of conviction (People V. Cioffi, 1 N Y 2d 70, 72). Here defendant’s certification to the care and custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission was made in a criminal action and is deemed a judgment of conviction (Mental Hygiene Law, § 208, subd. 5). The period of his commitment commenced on April 21, 1967, when the order of certification was made (Mental Hygiene Law, § 208, subd. 4, par. a). Escape from a rehabilitation center is a misdemeanor (Mental Hygiene Law, § 211, subd. 2), and defendant’s confinement therein is clearly imprisonment. No court or Judge has authority to interrupt a prisoner’s sentence after imprisonment thereunder has commenced (People ex rel. Rainone v. Murphy, 1 N Y 2d 367, 373). We find no fault with the sentences as imposed by the County Court; we do find that defendant’s immediate incarceration under the felony sentence was without authority in law, and hence the District Court sentence continued to run despite his incarceration under the County Court sentence. True, the commission has authority to discharge a defendant as rehabilitated prior to expiration of the three-year period (Mental Hygiene Law, § 208, subd. 4, par. a), but so far as the record discloses that was not done here. The commission does not have the power, by its own gratuitous act of delivering defendant to the County authorities for the service of a sentence imposed by the County Court, to interrupt the running of the District Court sentence (cf. People ex rel. Kenny v. Jackson, 4 N Y 2d 229, 233). Moreover, defendant’s incarceration under the felony sentence frustrates the rehabilitation program established by the statute (see Mental Hygiene Law, § 200). Accordingly, defendant should be transferred from his present place of incarceration to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission to serve the balance of the sentence imposed by the District Court on April 21, 1967, with due credit for all time served outside the custody of the commission from that date to the date of transfer, and upon termination of the District Court sentence defendant should be returned to State Prison to serve in full the sentence imposed by the County Court on June 22, 1967, with credit for the time already served thereunder up to the date of his return to the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission for the completion of his sentence under the prior conviction (cf.

"Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: Defendant appeals from three judgments convicting him upon his plea of guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, attempted criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to an aggregate term of incarceration of 11 to 22 years. Defendant contends that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered and that the sentence is unduly harsh or severe and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
By failing to move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the conviction, defendant has failed to preserve for our review his contention that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. In any event, the record establishes that defendant had ample time to confer with counsel before accepting the offer and stated during his plea colloquy that he was voluntarily pleading guilty and had not been threatened or forced to do so. We reject the contention that the court erred in accepting the guilty plea without making further inquiry to assure defendant’s intelligent waiver of the defense of agency. The record establishes that the court made appropriate inquiry (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Beasley, 25 NY2d 483, 487-488), repeatedly asking defendant if he had obtained a benefit as a result of the cocaine sales and informing defendant that he might have a good defense if he had merely acted as an agent for the buyers.
There is no merit to the contention that the sentence is unduly harsh or severe or that it constitutes cruel or unusual punishment. This is not one of those ""rare” cases in which a sentencing statute has been unconstitutionally applied (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100,119, cert denied 423 US 950; see, People v Thompson, 83 NY2d 477; People v Donovan, 59 NY2d 834, affg 89 AD2d 968; People v Jones, 39 NY2d 694).

"Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was promised a sentence of 2 to 4 years’ imprisonment. County Court advised defendant that, if he did not appear on the date of sentencing, he could receive a sentence of up to 31/2 to 7 years’ imprisonment. The court later repeated that the sentence could be enhanced if defendant failed to appear. Defendant responded that he understood the condition.
Defendant failed to appear for sentencing and the matter was adjourned. Defendant again did not appear, and the matter was again adjourned after the court directed the District Attorney to check local jails and hospitals. Defense counsel advised the court that he had left messages on defendant’s answering machine and sent defendant a letter but was ""at a loss to explain [defendant’s] failure to appear.” The court adjourned the matter once more, and again defendant did not appear. The District Attorney represented that he had contacted local jails and hospitals. The court sentenced defendant in absentia to 31/2 to 7 years’ imprisonment.
The court properly determined that defendant’s absence was deliberate. The court adjourned the sentencing on three occasions ""to allow both the prosecutor and defense counsel to attempt to locate defendant” (People v Reed, 197 AD2d 844, 845, affd 84 NY2d 945). The efforts of counsel constitute a reasonable inquiry (see, People v Reed, supra; People v Nance, 175 AD2d 185, lv denied 79 NY2d 861), and the court was not obligated to conduct any further investigation. ""Although the court failed to state on the record the facts and reasons upon which it relied in determining that defendant’s absence was deliberate, the record contains sufficient facts to support the court’s determination” (People v Reed, supra, at 845; cf., People v Brooks, 75 NY2d 898, mot to amend remittitur granted 76 NY2d 746).
Defendant further contends that his appearance before the court without counsel eight days after sentencing constituted the sentencing and that he therefore had a right to counsel. That contention is without merit. The court simply advised defendant that he had been sentenced in absentia.

"Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: In 1971 petitioner was sentenced to a seven-year term of imprison ment by the Tompkins County Court following his conviction on a charge of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the fourth degree. In 1973 he petitioned the Wyoming County Court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that his sentence was improper because he was not first given a drug addiction examination pursuant to the provisions of former section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law. His petition was dismissed on the ground that former section 207 only requires an addiction examination if the defendant states or indicates that he is an addict or if symptoms or other appearances of addiction are present. We agree with this interpretation (see Matter of Torres v Gallucci, 36 AD2d 966; People v Olson, 36 AD2d 749; People v Rivera, 73 Misc 2d 558; People v Maguire, 63 Misc 2d 711) and note that no claim of addiction was made at the time of sentencing. Even if it were, however, strict and literal compliance with former section 207 is unnecessary and an examination may be waived by the court upon determining that regardless of defendant’s addiction, a sentence of imprisonment is warranted (People v Carter, 31 NY2d 964).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered April 14, 1992, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to concurrent terms of 12-Vi to 25 years imprisonment on each count.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s sentence to concurrent indeterminate terms of 6 to 12 years imprisonment on each conviction; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that it was error to admit evidence of his prior conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree is without merit. Evidence of prior criminal acts ""may be admitted to prove intent * * * when the evidence falls short of demonstrating that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, and where proof of a prior act is relevant to that issue” (People v Jackson, 193 AD2d 621). In the instant case, since the only other evidence of the defendant’s intent was equivocal, we find that it was proper to admit evidence of the defendant’s prior conviction.
The defendant’s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated herein.
We have examined the defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Thompson, J.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Rotker, J.), rendered January 22, 1988, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
Pursuant to the indictment, the defendant was charged with committing the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.
Thereafter, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, to satisfy the indictment. Under the terms of the negotiated plea agreement, the defendant was promised that if he appeared for sentencing, he could withdraw his plea and waive the indictment, the indictment would be dismissed, a Superior Court Information would be filed, and he would be able to plead to a class E felony and receive a sentence of one and one-half to three years imprisonment. On the other hand, if he failed to appear for sentencing, the court stated that it would impose a sentence of up to 25 years on the defendant’s plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in the indictment. As the defendant did not appear for sentencing, the waiver of indictment was never executed, and he was sentenced, upon his plea, to four and one-half to nine years imprisonment.
It is true that the procedure contemplated by the plea agreement violated CPL 195.10 (2) (b), in that a waiver of indictment is not permitted once the indictment has been filed, and also amounted to an unauthorized reduction in charges under CPL 220.10 (5) (a) (ii) (see, People v Boston, 75 NY2d 585; People v Banville, 134 AD2d 116). However, the record indicates that the illegal plea agreement was never fulfilled, and indeed, was nullified, due to the defendant’s failure to appear at sentencing. The court clearly advised the defendant during the plea proceeding that if he did not appear for sentencing, he would be sentenced on his plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in the indictment, to a term of up to 25 years imprisonment. Under these circumstances, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed (see, People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917, 918; People v Warren, 121 AD2d 418). Mangano, P.

"— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Rockland County (Kelly, J.), rendered February 7, 1990, convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, upon her plea of guilty, and sentencing her to an indeterminate term of two to four years imprisonment and $40 in restitution.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by deleting therefrom the provision which directed the defendant to pay $40 in restitution; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
At the time the sentence was imposed, the court lacked authority to direct the defendant to make restitution of the $40 in unrecovered ""buy” money expended during the undercover drug sale that resulted in the defendant’s arrest (see, People v Rowe, 75 NY2d 948; People v Williams, 171 AD2d 713). Since this restitution was unauthorized under Penal Law § 60.27, that provision of the sentence must be vacated, even though the defendant agreed to it as part of the plea bargain (see, People v Simmons, 171 AD2d 822). We note that Penal Law § 60.27 was amended effective November 1, 1991, to authorize restitution to law enforcement agencies for unrecovered funds used in the purchase of drugs as part of investigations leading to convictions (see, Penal Law § 60.27 [9]).
We find that, based on the record before us, the contention of ineffective assistance of counsel raised by the defendant in her supplemental pro se brief is without merit (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).

"The court assessed a total of 70 points, which is just below the threshold for a level two adjudication, and then departed upward to level two. The court properly assessed 15 points under the risk factor for drug or alcohol abuse, since defendant had a long history of drug possession convictions that was not excessively remote in time and he had not sufficiently demonstrated a prolonged period of abstinence (see e.g. People v Warren, 42 AD3d 593, 594 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 810 [2007]; People v Regan, 46 AD3d 1434 [2007]).

"Cardona, EJ.
Petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the first degree and, under the terms of a plea agreement, was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Both the sentencing minutes and the uniform sentence and commitment form indicated that County Court recommended that petitioner be considered for the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program. County Court also, however, signed a separate order directing that petitioner be enrolled in the CASAT program. Subsequently, after petitioner began serving his sentence, his application for admission to the CASAT program was denied. Petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul that determination, which Supreme Court granted to the extent of ordering respondents to enroll petitioner in the first phase of the CASAT program. Respondents appeal and petitioner cross-appeals.
Petitioner argued before Supreme Court that respondents were required to enroll him in the CASAT program in accordance with County Court’s order specifically directing his enrollment in that program. We do not agree. Although a sentencing court is empowered to direct an individual’s enrollment in the CASAT program if the individual “stands convicted of a controlled substance or marihuana offense,” such was not the case here (Penal Law § 60.04 [6]; see People v Brown, 58 AD3d 540, 540 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 814 [2009]). Under these circumstances, the separate order by County Court directing petitioner’s enrollment in the CASAT program must be viewed as a nonbinding recommendation (see Correction Law § 71 [6]; People v Brown, 58 AD3d at 540; People v Parley, 297 AD2d 499, 501 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 503 [2002]; People v Sass, 182 AD2d 861, 862 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 837 [1992]). Since respondents were not required to enroll petitioner in the CASAT program, we need not address petitioner’s further claim that respondents were obliged to enroll him in all phases of that program.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Alfieri, J.), rendered November 29, 2011, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to two concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 10 years on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled, substance in the third degree, which are to run consecutively to two concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 10 years on the other counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, all counts to be followed by a period of three years of postrelease supervision.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that all the terms of imprisonment shall run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support his conviction is not preserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484, 491-492 [2008]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), the evidence was legally sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).
The defendant failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Stultz, 2 NY3d 277, 279 [2004]; Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 687-694 [1984]).
Although the period of time between the defendant’s 1999 conviction and the commission of the felonies for which he stands convicted in this case was more than 10 years, the 1999 conviction constituted a predicate felony for purposes of second felony offender sentencing, since the 10-year statutory period was tolled while the defendant was incarcerated from May 5, 2000, to February 22, 2007 (see Penal Law §§ 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]; 70.70 [3] [b] [i]). The defendant’s conclusory allegations were insufficient to support his contention that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained (see People v Penna, 47 AD3d 844 [2008]; People v Allen, 4 AD3d 479 [2004]; see also CPL 400.21 [7] [b]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County, rendered July 10, 1975, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of not more than five years. Defendant raises four issues on this appeal, viz., (1) the court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained by eavesdropping warrants and a search warrant, (2) the court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial evidence was not legally sufficient to establish the offense charged, (3) the court erred in admitting into evidence the People’s Exhibits Nos. 15 and 21-A,' and (4) the sentence imposed was excessive and unduly harsh. We find no merit in defendant’s claims. The eavesdropping warrants, the search warrant and the supporting papers are exactly the same as this court considered in People v Penna (53 AD2d 941). We hold that the facts alleged in support of the eavesdropping warrants and the search warrant were sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance thereof for the reasons set forth in People v Penna (supra). The record contains sufficient evidence to establish commission of the offense charged. Defendant points to his testimony that he did not know any marijuana was on the premises and that he had no marijuana in his possession or under his control. Defendant’s testimony was in sharp conflict with the testimony of Investigators Crowley and Padula. The jury resolved the conflict in the testimony in favor of the People. It is within the province of the jury to determine which of the conflicting testimony they believe (People v White, 2 NY2d 220). The trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence transcripts of taped telephone conversation, represented by People’s Exhibits Nos. 15 and 21-A. The record discloses that the transcripts were admitted for the limited purpose of aiding the jury in understanding the tapes when played. The jury was not allowed to use the transcripts in its deliberations. The trial court’s procedure is supported by precedent (People v Feld, 305 NY 322). Defendant was convicted of a class C felony subjecting him to a maximum sentence of 15 years (Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 2, par [c]). We are unable to conclude, as urged by defendant that under the circumstances the sentence of imprison ment for a term not to exceed five years was unduly harsh and excessive. The matter of sentencing rests within the sound discretion and judgment of the sentencing court and should be disturbed only under extraordinary circumstances (People v Perry, 52 AD2d 963).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered May 14, 2015, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of robbery in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the third degree.
On July 10, 2012, defendant, wearing clothing to conceal his identity, entered a pharmacy and handed a note to the pharmacist stating, “Give me all your oxycodone, 30 milligrams, and oxycontin, I have a knife.” The pharmacist complied with the demand, and defendant exited the pharmacy with a bag containing approximately 1,192 pills worth $5,253. After law enforcement received a tip from defendant’s former spouse, defendant was arrested in 2014 in Delaware and charged in an indictment with robbery in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the third degree. Following a jury trial, during which defendant admitted to robbing the pharmacy but denied that he possessed a knife, he was convicted of the lesser included offense of robbery in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the third degree. County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 2V3 to 7 years on his conviction for robbery in the third degree, 2V3 to 7 years on his conviction for grand larceny in the third degree and eight years, with five years of postrelease supervision, on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. Defendant was also fined $5,000. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that his sentence was harsh and excessive given, among other things, his military service-related mental health issues, as well as his opiate addiction resulting from prescriptions that he received to address the effects of malaria, which he contracted during his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. This Court has the broad authority to modify a sentence in the interest of justice, even one within the permissible statutory parameters (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783 [1992]; People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]). In light of defendant’s admission from the outset that he perpetrated the robbery, albeit without a knife, the correlation between the illness that he contracted while serving in Afghanistan and an opioid addiction that precipitated this event, his duly expressed remorse and his lack of any prior criminal record, we find that his sentence for the criminal possession of a controlled substance conviction was unduly severe and should be reduced to three years, with five years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently with the sentences for his other convictions. Correspondingly, we vacate the $5,000 fine.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered May 22, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to IV2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Contrary to his assertion here, our review of the record reveals that defendant’s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Kennedy, 46 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 841 [2008]). Indeed, County Court’s remarks regarding a theoretical motion to withdraw the plea were made while ensuring that defendant fully understood the ramifications of pleading guilty and followed a detailed colloquy during which defendant informed County Court that he had discussed the matter with his attorney, was not impaired and had not been coerced into entering the plea (see People v Rock, 56 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 787 [2009]; People v Washington, 51 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2008]). The record likewise reflects County Court’s understanding that a sufficient factual basis for accepting the plea existed and that defendant’s plea was the product of a rational and voluntary choice (see People v Matthie, 34 AD3d 987, 989 [2006], lvs denied 8 NY3d 805, 847 [2007]; People v Stewart, 307 AD2d 533, 534 [2003]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Sherman, J.), rendered November 4, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts).
Pursuant to a written plea memorandum, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced, pursuant to the agreement, to an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment of SVs years to life for the possession charge and 1 to 3 years for each of the sale charges, all sentences to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction and, thus, his challenge to the sufficiency of his plea has not been preserved for our review (see People v Santalucia, 19 AD3d 806, 807 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 856 [2005]). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s challenge, we would find it to be without merit.
To the extent that defendant seeks resentencing pursuant to the provisions of Penal Law § 70.71, we need note only that such relief must be sought in the court that imposed the original sentence (see L 2005, ch 643, § 1). Finally, we have considered defendant’s remaining arguments and find them to be lacking in merit.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Sgueglia, J.), rendered January 4, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 5 to 10 years after pleading guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He contends on this appeal that the sentence was harsh and excessive and requests that it be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree. A sentence that falls within the permissible statutory guidelines will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or there are extraordinary circumstances that would warrant modification in the interest of justice (see People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872). In this case, defendant’s extensive criminal history, as well as the fact that his sentence was the anticipated outcome of a plea bargain agreement, militate against a reduction in his sentence (see People v Kelly, 279 AD2d 891, lv denied 96 NY2d 802; People v McGarry, 219 AD2d 744, lv denied 87 NY2d 848). The record discloses that defendant’s criminal record spans over 30 years and includes 14 previous sentences of incarceration resulting from criminal convictions that include rape in the third degree, grand larceny, robbery in the third degree, attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and intimidating a victim/witness in the third degree.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Coccoma, J.), rendered May 24, 1996, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon the trial of an indictment charging two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was found guilty of both counts. At a combined sentencing and plea proceeding, defendant was sentenced to two consecutive indeterminate prison terms of 3 to 9 years on the drug sale charges and, in satisfaction of two related indictments and other pending charges, he entered a plea of guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived the right to appeal not only the weapon possession conviction based on the plea but also the drug sale conviction based on the verdict at trial. He filed a notice of appeal from the judgment convicting him of the drug sale charges and was thereafter sentenced on the weapon possession charge in accordance with the plea bargain. Assigned counsel now moves to be relieved of the assignment on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues.
In the absence of any argument or anything in the record to suggest that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal was not knowingly and voluntarily made or that it was designed to conceal error or prosecutorial overreaching, the waiver is en forceable with regard, to both judgments of conviction (see, People v Govan, 199 AD2d 815, lv denied 83 NY2d 853), including the one from which defendant appeals. Accordingly, based upon our review of the record, we agree with assigned counsel that there are no nonfrivolous issues. In so concluding, we have considered the issues raised by defendant in his pro se brief and find that, to the extent they survived defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9), they have no arguable merit. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed and assigned counsel’s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see, People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650).

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of SVa to 7 years. On appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Although defendant points to his history of substance abuse, abusive upbringing and positive employment history in requesting a reduced sentence, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting the reduction of the agreed-upon sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Kelly, 279 AD2d 891 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 802 [2001]; People v Oliver, 251 AD2d 749 [1998]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered November 8, 1993, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
■Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment. Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on appeal on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised. We agree. A review of the records and briefs in this case, including the arguments raised by defendant in her pro se brief, reveal that there are no nonfrivolous issues which could be raised and therefore defense counsel’s application to withdraw should be granted.
We do note, however, that during the plea proceedings the People recommended and defendant accepted that she be sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 41/2 to 9 years. The People repeated the terms of the promise at the outset of the sentence proceedings. At sentencing, however, County Court imposed a term of 4 to 9 years. All indications in the record support the conclusion that the court merely misspoke and intended the sentence to be the sentence proffered by the People and defendant (see, People v Brown, 205 AD2d 854, lv denied 84 NY2d 866). In fact, by statute the recommended sentence of 41/2 to 9 years was the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [b]). In view of the clear indication by the court to impose that sentence, remitting the matter for resentencing would be pointless (see, People v Pizzano, 127 AD2d 858). We therefore modify the judgment accordingly.

The sentence was in accordance with the plea bargain and was well within the statutory limits.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J.), rendered July 28, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In December 1997, defendant was stopped by a State Trooper for driving in excess of the posted speed limit, and a subsequent search of defendant’s vehicle resulted in the seizure of a quantity of cocaine. As a consequence, defendant was arrested and ultimately indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. Following defendant’s unsuccessful motion to suppress the cocaine seized in the search of his vehicle, he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and, as part of the negotiated plea, waived his right to appeal. Defendant thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of 4V2 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Our review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal, which included the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion (see, People v Collier, 232 AD2d 878, lv denied 89 NY2d 863). Accordingly, we decline to entertain the merits of defendant’s assertion that"" County Court erred in denying his suppression motion. While defendant’s contentions that his plea was not voluntary and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel indeed survive his waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; People v Epps, 255 AD2d 840), we find each assertion to be without merit and, accordingly, affirm.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County, rendered July 16, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree. Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree. He was sentenced to a five-year term of probation. On this appeal his major contention is that he was entrapped, as a matter of law, as defined by section 40.05 of the Penal Law, and, consequently, the verdict should be reversed and the indictment dismissed. Proof offered ;by the prosecution consisted mainly of the testimony of a State Trooper who worked as an undercover agent and of an informer. The record reveals that there are contradictions in the testimony of the two prosecution witnesses and also between their testimony and the proof offered by the defendant. This, however, created only questions of fact and credibility for the jury to determine. They were implicitly determined against the defendant. An examination of the record in its entirety convinces us that there was sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that defendant failed to establish the defense of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. The record, in our view, also contains ample proof to justify a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered December 2, 2011, which resentenced defendant following his conviction upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court agreed to sentence him to no more than five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision, provided that he abide by the terms of his release to probation supervision pending sentencing. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to a prison term of five years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Although defendant’s argument that his plea was not voluntary is not precluded by his waiver of appeal, the record does not reflect that defendant preserved this argument by making a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Whitfield, 94 AD3d 1238, 1238 [2012]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]).

Finally, defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Stoff, 74 AD3d 1640, 1641 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 810 [2010]; People v Walley, 63 AD3d 1284, 1286 [2009]; People v Rogers, 15 AD3d at 683).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Mogavero, Jr., J.), rendered January 14, 1991, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On this appeal from the conviction arising out of his sale of cocaine to an informant, defendant contends that County Court erred in permitting the People to reopen their case following the summations in order to allow the informant to testify. Despite diligent efforts, the People were unable to locate the informant. At the close of the People’s case, the court stated that it would permit the People to reopen their case if the informant was located by 9:00 the following morning, and the court directed the attorneys to proceed with their summations. The informant appeared the next morning and he was permitted to testify, after which the attorneys again presented summations.
The statutory order of trial (CPL 260.30) is not a rigid framework; the trial court retains its common-law discretionary power to alter the order of proof ""at least up to the time the case is submitted to the jury” (People v Olsen, 34 NY2d 349, 353). We see no abuse of that discretion here. The informant’s testimony was clearly relevant if not crucial to the People’s case, and there is nothing to suggest that the People were seeking to gain an improper tactical advantage (see, People v Murray, 165 AD2d 690, lv denied 77 NY2d 880).
Next, defendant contends that County Court erred in permitting one of the People’s witnesses to ""buttress the character” of the informant. In the absence of a timely objection by defendant, we are of the view that the error, if any, is not reviewable (see, People v Major, 142 AD2d 603). In any event, defense counsel initiated the line of questioning concerning the witness’s assessment of the informant’s reliability.
We also reject defendant’s final contention that his prison sentence of 5 to 15 years is harsh and excessive. The harshest sentence for the class B felony committed by defendant is 8 Vs to 25 years (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [B]; [3] [B]). Although defendant’s sentence was made consecutive with his sentence on a second drug conviction (see, People v Hinkley, 178 AD2d 821 [decided herewith]), we see neither a clear abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances and, therefore, we will not disturb the sentence (see, People v Jones, 85 AD2d 50, 55).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered November 16, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging her with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that she would be sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. As a condition of her release pending sentencing, County Court warned defendant that it was authorized to impose an enhanced sentence of 8V3 to 25 years in prison if she failed to appear for sentencing or was arrested on new charges before then. Defendant failed to appear on the scheduled sentencing date and eventually returned to court several months later, at which time she claimed that her nonappearance on the original sentencing date was not willful because she feared that any sentence imposed would be served at the County Jail where she had been sexually harassed by a correction officer during a previous period of incarceration. County Court adjourned the sentencing hearing in order to permit further investigation into this claim but, when the results of the investigation were disclosed on the new sentencing date two months later, the court found that defendant failed to substantiate her claim of sexual harassment. Defendant’s request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of willfulness was denied, following which County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, County Court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to imposing the enhanced sentence since the court gave defendant an opportunity to demonstrate the alleged mitigating circumstances surrounding her nonappearance and was ultimately satisfied that defendant’s claim had no legitimate basis (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712-713; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880). Notwithstanding defendant’s lack of prior criminal involvement, because defendant was fully aware that her nonappearance could result in an enhanced sentence and the sentence imposed was less than the harshest she could have received, we decline to reduce defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v O’Byrne, 262 AD2d 867, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024; People v Dove, 236 AD2d 644).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered February 13, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends on this appeal that his guilty plea was coerced and that the sentence imposed of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. Defendant failed to either move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and has therefore failed to preserve his argument that the plea was coerced (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662; People v Guerrero, 176 AD2d 348, lv denied 79 NY2d 857; People v Calero-Atehortua, 172 AD2d 323, lv denied 78 NY2d 920). In any event, the fact that defendant feared that if he was convicted after trial of the crimes alleged in the six-count indictment he would have received a harsher sentence then he received on his plea to one count of the indictment does not constitute coercion (see, People v Mackey, 175 AD2d 346, 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 969). Finally, given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, he received less than the harshest possible sentence and that he pleaded guilty knowing what sentence would ultimately be imposed by County Court, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). We have considered defendant’s other arguments and find them to be without merit.

"Lynch, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered February 14, 2012, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
On January 21, 2010, defendant was charged in a felony complaint with a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, based on the sale of one half of an 80 milligram Oxycontin pill to a police informant in August 2009. Thereafter, on July 29, 2010, defendant was indicted and charged with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree: the first count was based on the August 5, 2009 event underlying the felony complaint, and the remaining counts were based on two sales of the same amount of Oxycontin to the same informant on August 24, 2009. The People also announced their readiness for trial on July 29, 2010.
Defendant thereafter moved to dismiss the indictment based on statutory speedy trial grounds. The People conceded that count 1 was untimely, but otherwise opposed the motion. County Court initially granted the motion, but, upon the People’s letter request to reconsider, ultimately reinstated counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on both counts and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of four years on each count followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Upon the filing of a felony complaint commencing a criminal action, the People must be ready for trial within six months (see CPL 30.30 [1] [a]; People v Nelson, 68 AD3d 1252, 1253 [2009]). A criminal action is commenced upon the filing of the first accusatory instrument (see CPL 1.20 [16] [a]) and “includes the filing of all further accusatory instruments directly derived from the initial one” (CPL 1.20 [16] [b] [emphasis added]; accord People ex rel. Greenstein v Sheriff of Schenectady County, 220 AD2d 190, 192 [1996]). Here, the issue distills to whether counts 2 and 3 of the indictment are directly derived from the felony complaint as part of the same criminal transaction (see People v Lowman, 103 AD3d 976, 977 [2013]). If so, the speedy trial time frame would relate back to the filing of the felony complaint; if not, that time period would be triggered by the indictment (see id.; People v Nelson, 68 AD3d at 1254; People v Dearstyne, 230 AD2d 953, 955 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 921 [1996]).
As a threshold point, citing to CPL 210.20 (4), defendant maintains that, after dismissing the indictment, County Court lacked authority to reconsider the matter simply on the basis of the People’s letter request. We disagree. CPL 210.20 (4) speaks to the court’s authority to authorize the People to resubmit a charge to the grand jury, but only where the indictment is dismissed on certain grounds that do not include a speedy trial violation (see CPL 210.20 [1] [g]; [4]). The question here, however, is whether the court retains inherent authority to rectify a prior error in dismissing an indictment, and it is our
view that the court has such authority (see People v Rosa, 265 AD2d 167, 167 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 884 [2000]; People v Clarke, 203 AD2d 916, 916 [1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 965 [1994]; see also People v Lynch, 162 AD2d 134, 134 [1990], lv denied 76 NY2d 941 [1990]). Although no formal reargument motion was made, which would have been preferable, the letter request alerted the court to the error, and the court conducted a hearing before finalizing the reinstatement of counts 2 and 3. Since defendant was given a full opportunity to be heard on the reinstatement request, we perceive no error.
The further question is whether the events alleged in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment are part of the same criminal transaction as count 1 (see CPL 40.10 [2] [b]). Although each sale involved the identical amount of Oxycontin and the same participants, we find no error in County Court’s conclusion that the two separate sales on August 24, 2009 were separate and distinct from the transaction occurring almost three weeks earlier (see People v Sant, 120 AD3d 517, 518-519 [2014]; People v Lowman, 103 AD3d at 977-978; People v Brown, 20 AD3d 577, 578-579 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 826 [2005]; People v Dearstyne, 230 AD2d at 955). As such, the speedy trial period for counts 2 and 3 commenced with the filing of the indictment, not the earlier felony complaint. It follows that County Court properly denied defendant’s speedy trial motion as to these counts of the indictment.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered June 4, 2001 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon of his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was thereafter sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. Defendant appeals.
At the outset, we note that defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his current attack on the voluntariness of the plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Smith, 305 AD2d 853, 854 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 624 [2003]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635 [2001]). Were we to reach the issue, our examination of the plea minutes reveals that Supreme Court conducted a thorough and proper colloquy, during which it ascertained that defendant was entering the plea free of duress or any condition that would hamper his understanding or willingness to accept the consequences thereof, he had discussed the matter at length with his retained counsel and was satisfied with the services he provided, and he freely and unequivocally admitted to facts establishing the elements of the crime for which he was entering the plea (see Penal Law §§ 110.00, 220.16; People v Smith, supra at 854; People v McWhite, 295 AD2d 757, 758 [2002]). In response to defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea, we note that there is no requirement that defendant personally recite the facts underlying his crime (see People v Kinch, 237 AD2d 830, 831 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 860 [1997]), particularly where, as here, defendant’s affirmative answers during Supreme Court’s inquiry therein neither cast doubt on his guilt nor otherwise raised any issues regarding the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lind, 298 AD2d 765, 766 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 616 [2003]). Defendant’s additional argument that defense counsel’s failure to investigate possible defenses impacted the voluntariness of his plea finds no support in the record and, in any event, is belied by defendant’s own statements that he had fully discussed his options with his counsel to his satisfaction (see People v Anderson, 304 AD2d 975, 976 [2003] , lv denied 100 NY2d 578 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]). Finding no basis for determining that the plea was anything but knowing, voluntary and intelligent, we decline to disturb it (see People v Donaldson, 1 AD3d 800, 800-801 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 739 [2004] ).
Defendant’s remaining argument that his sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded by his general waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733 [1998]; People v Varno, 297 AD2d 873, 874 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 565 [2002]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered December 15, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Resolving a six-count indictment, defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement to 4 to 8 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea, although not encompassed by his waiver of appeal, is not properly before us given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Smith, 37 AD3d 975, 975-976 [2007]). As for defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is precluded by his valid appeal waiver except insofar as the alleged ineffectiveness could be construed to have impacted upon the voluntariness of his plea and, to that extent, the absence of a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders the matter unpreserved for our review (see People v Missimer, 32 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 927 [2006]). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the record indicates that defen dant’s plea was other than voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered or that he was afforded less than meaningful representation (see People v La Caille, 26 AD3d 592, 593 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 835 [2006]). Finally, in light of defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal, his contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive is foreclosed (see People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered August 6, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted in January 2001 for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, stemming from the sale of crack cocaine to a police informant for $250. During pretrial proceedings, County Court denied defendant’s requests that Wade, Rodriguez and/or pretrial identification hearings be held to confirm that defendant was properly identified as having made the subject sale. Following pretrial discussions, defendant rejected all plea bargain offers and the matter proceeded to trial. The day following commencement of the trial, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, with the promise of an indeterminate prison term of SVa to 7 years.
On appeal, defendant contends that since defense counsel repeatedly questioned the reliability of the identification made by the confidential informant, County Court erred in denying his request for a Wade, Rodriguez and/or a pretrial identification hearing. Defendant’s contention must be rejected. Defendant is entitled to a hearing to determine the admissibility of identification testimony where there has been a previous identification of the defendant by a prospective trial witness (see CPL 710.20 [6]). Here, the People served a CPL 710.30 notice which indicated that there would be no eyewitness testimony by any person who had previously identified the defendant as being the individual who committed the crime charged. Under these circumstances, the court’s denial of a hearing was entirely proper.
Defendant next argues that it was error for County Court to deny him a pretrial proceeding that would test the reliability of a proposed trial identification. Defendant’s right to appellate review of this issue “raised before the plea is forfeited by operation of law as a consequence of a guilty plea” (People v Campbell, 73 NY2d 481, 486; see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230; People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5; People v Perkins, 288 AD2d 506, 507, lv denied 97 NY2d 707). Upon review of the record, we find that County Court conducted an appropriate plea allocution wherein defendant’s guilt was established by his knowing and voluntary plea. “Where a defendant has by his plea admitted commission of the crime with which he is charged, the plea more than a confession, signals defendant’s intention not to litigate the question of his guilt * * *” (People v Campbell, supra at 486 [citations omitted]), and the plea operates to extinguish any claims made prior to the plea (see People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 87-88, lv denied 98 NY2d 642). Furthermore, defendant’s demand for a pretrial in-court identification proceeding does not fall within the “limited group of questions which survive a plea” (People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993), and thus no issue in this regard has been preserved for our review.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lament, J.), rendered February 18, 2005 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a five-count indictment with various crimes stemming from his possession and sale of heroin. Following a pretrial suppression hearing, County Court (Herrick, J.) denied defendant’s motion to suppress the drugs and drug paraphernalia that had been seized. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and reopen the suppression hearing on the basis that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel. As relevant here, defendant claimed that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because his attorney misinformed him regarding the possible term of incarceration that he faced. Supreme Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Prior to pleading guilty, defendant indicated that he understood his rights, had fully discussed the case and potential defenses with his attorney, was satisfied with his attorney’s representation and was entering his guilty plea freely and voluntarily (see People v La Caille, 26 AD3d 592, 593 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 835 [2006]; People v Henning, 2 AD3d 979, 980 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 740 [2004]). The record also reveals that defense counsel, who conferred with defendant immediately after Supreme Court detailed the agreed-upon sentence, obtained a very favorable plea bargain which significantly reduced defendant’s prison exposure. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant was afforded meaningful representation and that his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Bolden, 14 AD3d 934, 935 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 796 [2005]; People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 935 [2004]; People v Stone, 9 AD3d 498, 499 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 712 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered November 13, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
While executing a search warrant at a residence located in Washington County, police officers recovered a quantity of heroin, cash and drug paraphernalia. Defendant was present at the residence during the search along with others. As a result, he was charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree. In satisfaction of the indictment, defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to the amended charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, to IV2 years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Initially, the People concede, and we agree, that defendant’s waiver of appeal was invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of People v Lopez (6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]) and, as such, he is not precluded from raising substantive challenges to the judgment of conviction (see People v Roshia, 133 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2015], affd 28 NY3d 989 [2016]). Defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective due to his failure to request a suppression hearing with respect to items confiscated during the search. He further claims that his Alford plea was invalid because it was involuntary and County Court accepted it without any strong evidence of defendant’s guilt. Significantly, however, the record does not reveal that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion. Consequently, these claims have not been preserved for our review (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1563 [2017]; People v Saylor, 132 AD3d 1018, 1018 [2015]; People v Mears, 16 AD3d 917, 917-918 [2005]; People v Ebert, 15 AD3d 781, 782 [2005]). Furthermore, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d at 1563; People v Cooks, 150 AD3d 1323, 1324 [2017]).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered July 18, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 to 9 years. Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that his sentence was illegal. Because the minimum sentence he received, two years, was ”no[t] more than one-third of the maximum term imposed” (Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [b]), the sentence was in all respects legal. We also reject defendant’s alternative argument that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, and the plea was in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. In addition, defendant could have received a maximum prison term of 25 years (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]). Under such circumstances, we find neither extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of discretion by County Court warranting a reduction of the sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

Defendant was indicted and charged with five counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to the first count of the indictment in full satisfaction thereof and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 7V2 to 15 years.
The arguments raised by defendant on appeal do not warrant extended discussion. Defendant initially asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the indictment. By pleading guilty, however, defendant forfeited his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury (see e.g. People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97, 108), and the narrow exception to this rule (see id. at 109) is not applicable here. Nor are we persuaded that the sentence imposed was harsh or excessive. The underlying sentence, which was well within the permissible statutory range, was part of an agreed-upon plea bargain, and our review of the record discloses no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction thereof. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered June 8, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a five-count indictment, pursuant to a plea agreement that included an appeal waiver. After denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea, County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of two years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant did not effectively waive his right to appeal because neither the oral colloquy nor the written appeal waiver advised defendant that the appeal waiver “is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1265 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]). While defendant’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent was preserved for appellate review by his motion to vacate the plea, this claim lacks merit (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]). County Court advised him of the terms of the plea agreement, the trial-related rights that he was forgoing and the consequences of his plea, and he was afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel and indicated that he understood the plea terms and agreed to them. Defendant then admitted to each of the allegations in count 1 of the indictment. He was not required to recite the elements of the crime or the underlying facts, as his unequivocal affirmative responses to the court’s questions were adequate to establish his guilt (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).
We reject defendant’s contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because counsel “allowed” him to plead guilty while his statutory speedy trial motion was pending (see People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]). Counsel made and pursued a motion to dismiss on statutory speedy trial grounds (compare People v Garcia, 33 AD3d 1050, 1051-1052 [2006], lv denied 9 NY3d 844 [2007]), and presumably weighed the likelihood of success on that motion when advising defendant to accept a plea to only one of five counts, with a promise of the minimum sentence on that count. It was ultimately defendant’s decision whether to accept the- plea agreement while that motion remained undecided. To the extent that defendant raises arguments concerning what counsel advised him with regard to whether to enter a guilty plea and what documents defendant may or may not have had when he entered his plea, those arguments address matters outside the record on appeal, which are more properly raised in a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Haffiz, 19 NY3d 883, 885 [2012]; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1379-1380 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 965 [2014]). By pleading guilty, aware of the fact that his CPL 30.30 motion was pending, defendant forfeited that defense (see People v O’Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]; People v Friscia, 51 NY2d 845, 847 [1980]; People v Irvis, 90 AD3d 1302, 1303 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 962 [2012]; People v Burke, 90 AD3d 1246, 1247 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 956 [2012]).

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that his sentence of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. The sentence he received was within the statutory guidelines and consistent with the plea-bargain agreement. Given these circumstances, and considering the seriousness of the crime of which defendant was convicted, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Maye, 143 AD2d 483, lv denied 73 NY2d 788).

"Stein, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered December 14, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment stemming from two cocaine sales, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of two years to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision between IV2 and 3 years. He declined to withdraw his plea after learning that he did not qualify as a predicate felon, but that his sentence would not be reduced. He argued, however, that alternatives to a prison sentence or, at the very least, a shorter sentence should be considered. County Court imposed a prison sentence of two years to be followed by postrelease supervision of two years, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s mistaken belief that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender when he entered his guilty plea did not render his appeal waiver invalid and, to the extent that he also challenges the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea, the record does not reflect that he preserved that claim for our review by moving to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Ortiz, 69 AD3d 966, 967-968 [2010]; People v Dean, 52 AD3d 1308, 1308-1309 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 736 [2008]). Defendant’s valid appeal waiver bars his further claims that the sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Griffin, 100 AD3d 1153, 1154 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1011 [2013]) and that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to have him evaluated for inclusion in the judicial diversion program (see CPL art 216; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; People v Ivey, 79 AD3d 1531, 1532 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 859 [2011]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered April 11, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a multicount indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court agreed to impose a prison sentence of at least IV2 years followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision but no more than eight years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Moreover, it was agreed that this sentence was to run concurrently to a sentence imposed upon defendant’s conviction on a separate charge pending in Albany County. The court adhered to the plea agreement and imposed a prison sentence of six years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to the previously specified sentence. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not preserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that defendant moved to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Musser, 106 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2013]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not triggered, as nothing said during the plea colloquy cast doubt upon defendant’s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2012]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]). To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument relates to the voluntariness of his plea, it is likewise unpreserved (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v Jimenez, 96 AD3d 1109, 1110 [2012]). Finally, defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853-854 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d at 1292).

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered October 10, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was arrested and charged with crimes after police discovered cocaine on his person. In full satisfaction of these charges, he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. As part of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to the agreed-upon prison term of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, together with an order directing his enrollment in a shock incarceration program.
Defendant appeals.
First, defendant contends that the evidence against him should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. However, such contention does not survive a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Santalucia, 19 AD3d 806, 807 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 856 [2005]; People v Hodge, 4 AD3d 676, 677 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 800 [2004]). Defendant does not claim that his waiver was invalid, and the record reveals that County Court explained the nature and consequences of the waiver in detail, distinguished this aspect of defendant’s plea agreement from the other rights forfeited by his guilty plea, and ascertained that defendant understood these explanations (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1131-1132 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]). Accordingly, the waiver of the right to appeal was valid, and defendant’s challenge to the legality of his arrest is foreclosed (see People v Hodge, 4 AD3d at 677).
Defendant also contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney’s failure to request a suppression hearing. To the extent that this claim implicates the voluntariness of his plea and thus survives his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Wicks, 83 AD3d 1223, 1225 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]), it is nevertheless unpreserved for appellate review, as the record does not reveal that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014]; People v White, 122 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2014]; People v Moses, 110 AD3d 1118, 1118-1119 [2013]). In any event, the failure to request a sup pression hearing, standing alone, does not establish that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2010]; People v Jackson, 67 AD3d 1067, 1068 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 801 [2010]). Here, nothing else in the record casts doubt on the effectiveness of defense counsel, who, among other things, secured an advantageous plea bargain for defendant. Defendant affirmed during the plea colloquy that he was satisfied with his counsel’s representation, and if the issue had been preserved, we would have concluded that he received meaningful representation (see People v Aitken, 101 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1040 [2013]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]; People v Gentry, 73 AD3d at 1384).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered April 9, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree. Defendant contemporaneously pleaded guilty to a separate indictment charging him with two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, which fol lowed his sale of narcotic drugs on two occasions. No promises were made regarding sentencing, and sentencing was adjourned to allow defendant to continue treatment for his opiate addiction. After defendant was discharged from a treatment program for noncompliance, County Court imposed a prison term of IV3 to 4 years on the stolen property conviction, and concurrent four-year prison terms followed by two years of postrelease supervision on each of the drug convictions, the latter sentences to be served consecutively to the former. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentences should be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree. The record reflects that County Court adjourned sentencing, affording defendant the opportunity to continue outpatient treatment, but required favorable treatment updates and warned defendant not to miss treatment meetings. The court ultimately rejected a probationary sentence based upon, among other factors, his problematic engagement with treatment and eventual discharge from an outpatient treatment program for noncompliance. Given that the sentence was far less than the maximum, defendant’s repeated treatment transgressions and the seriousness of the charges, we cannot conclude that there was an abuse of sentencing discretion or that extraordinary circumstances warrant a modification in the interest of justice (see People v Ashlaw, 126 AD3d 1236, 1237 [2015]; People v Miller, 94 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2012]).

In satisfaction of a nine-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4xh to 9 years. We reject defendant’s initial claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because he was represented by three different attorneys from the Public Defender’s office. The record reveals that each of the attorneys who appeared on defendant’s behalf performed competently and that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see, People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796, 799-800; People v Nusbaum, 222 AD2d 723, 725).
In addition, we do not find that the sentence imposed is harsh or excessive. Defendant had numerous prior drug-related convictions and was charged with nine additional drug-related crimes prior to entering his guilty plea. In view of this, as well as the fact that the sentence was agreed to by defendant, we find no reason to disturb it.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered April 17, 1998, convicting defendant upon her pleas of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In February 1997, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that she would be sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. On May 5, 1997, defendant failed to appear for sentencing and a warrant was issued for her arrest. In June 1997, a second indictment charged defendant with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in connection with drug transactions which had occurred in April 1997, while defendant was awaiting sentencing on the first indictment. De fendant was ultimately arrested and returned to Chemung County, where she pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the second indictment. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and 5 to 15 years on the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Under the circumstances of this case, and given defendant’s criminal history, we find no merit to her sole claim on appeal that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive. The sentences were less than the maximum authorized, consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, and were imposed concurrently despite the fact that at the time of the sale defendant was out on bail awaiting sentencing on the possession charge and later absconded. We find no extraordinary circumstances warranting modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Kitchings, 239 AD2d 665, lv denied 90 NY2d 860; People v Wilson, 209 AD2d 792, lv denied 84 NY2d 1040).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Sheridan, J.), rendered January 21, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and perjury in the first degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, all arising out of his alleged possession and sale of cocaine on December 10, 1996. At the arraignment on the indictment, defendant indicated that his name was Anthony Smith, his date of birth was May 17, 1973 and his Social Security number was [ XXX-XX-XXXX ]. Defendant was released on a $40,000 unsecured bail bond. Subsequently, the bail guarantor advised County Court of concerns that defendant was attempting to establish an identity in another name. Consequently, a bail review hearing was conducted on July 21, 1997. At that time, defendant was placed under oath and questioned by County Court concerning his name, age, date of birth, address, Social Security number and prior criminal record. Defendant gave responses that the People’s investigation showed to be false. As a result, the People filed a superior court information charging a single count of perjury in the first degree. Ultimately, as part of a plea bargain, defendant disposed of the indictment and superior court information with guilty pleas to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and perjury in the first degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 to 12 years and 1 to 3 years. Defendant now appeals. We affirm.
We first note that by his plea of guilty to peijury in the first degree, defendant waived all factual defenses to that charge, including the present claim that he was snared in the People’s “perjury trap” (see, People v Di Raffaele, 55 NY2d 234, 240; People v Chevalier, 226 AD2d 925, lv denied 88 NY2d 934). In any event, because the questions County Court asked at the July 21, 1997 bail hearing were pertinent to a proper investigation of the issues under consideration, there is no basis for a finding of a perjury trap (see, People v Schenkman, 46 NY2d 232; People v Pomerantz, 46 NY2d 240; People v Tyler, 46 NY2d 251; People v Panico, 111 AD2d 358).
Second, in view of the fact that defendant did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction rendered thereon, he has waived his right to appellate review of his claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel or (implicit therein) that his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see, People v Soto, 259 AD2d 904; People v Depta, 257 AD2d 916). Were we to consider defendant’s contentions, we would reject them as lacking in merit. Defendant received an advantageous plea bargain and nothing in the record casts any doubt on the apparent effectiveness of his counsel (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404), defendant’s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666).
Finally, defendant has pointed to no circumstances supporting his vague contention that the negotiated sentence, which was imposed by County Court in accordance with the plea bargain, was harsh and excessive.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Giardino, J.), rendered November 26, 1996, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We reject the contention that the jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as the result of his February 22, 1996 sale of crack cocaine to a confidential informant was not supported by legally sufficient evidence or was against the weight of the evidence because of purported deficiencies in the People’s identification evidence (see, People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495). The People presented three eyewitnesses to the sale, i.e., the confidential informant and two police officers who observed the transaction through binoculars (one of whom had known defendant for 15 years), as well as a videotape which clearly captured the transaction and provided an essentially unmistakable means of identifying defendant as the perpetrator of the crime. Further, in view of defendant’s status as a second felony offender and his exposure to a potential prison term of 12V2 to 25 years (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]), we are unpersuaded that the 10 to 20-year prison term imposed by County Court was harsh or excessive.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered July 18, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In exchange for his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant was promised a sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison. However, as a result of defendant’s failure to appear in court on the date scheduled for his sentencing, County Court refused to impose the agreed-upon sentence and instead imposed a sentence as a second felony offender of 31/2 to 7 years in prison. County Court further denied defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On appeal, defendant claims that County Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea since the court reneged on the original sentencing agreement. We disagree. At the plea hearing, County Court informed defendant that if he did not appear for sentencing ""all deals are off”. In view of defendant’s failure to comply with an explicit condition of the plea agreement, we find that County Court was free to impose a harsher sentence and did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Radek, 202 AD2d 847, lv denied 84 NY2d 939; People v Webster, 202 AD2d 710).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered November 9, 1983, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
On October 5, 1983, defendant entered her plea to a prosecutor’s information. It was understood that her plea waived her right to be indicted by a Grand Jury and that her sentence would be 2 to 4 years in prison. On November 9, 1983, defendant was charged with a prior conviction of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree in April 1974. Defendant was given the 2-td-4-year sentence as promised.
On this appeal, defendant complains initially that the amendment of the prosecutor’s information as to the date of her commission of the crime was prejudicial. Defendant did not object to the amendment, however, when it was made at the time of her plea and we find no showing of prejudice in the circumstances.
As to the severity of her sentence, defendant’s prior conviction and her numerous lesser brushes with the law have clearly demonstrated that defendant has no desire to overcome her drug dependency and to rehabilitate herself. In these circumstances, the sentence was justified. The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered May 6, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and signed a “participation agreement” whereby he consented to participate and complete a “drug court program”. Defendant’s sentencing date was adjourned for this purpose and the agreement clearly stated that, in the event the program was successfully completed, he would receive a sentence of time served along with five years’ probation. In the event defendant did not comply with the agreement, however, it was understood that he would be sentenced to a term of incarceration. Thereafter, defendant was discharged from the drug court program for failing to comply with the rules. Following a hearing, County Court found defendant guilty of willfully violating the terms and conditions of his sentence. The court subsequently sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 21/s to 7 years in prison. This appeal followed.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s argument, we conclude that the People proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his sentence (see generally, CPL 410.70 [3]; see also, People v Recor, 209 AD2d 831, 832, affd 87 NY2d 933). Notably, at the violation hearing, the People presented two witnesses, one of whom was defendant’s case manager, who testified that defendant was discharged, from the program for, inter alla, violating the attendance policies for treatment meetings. Given the unambiguous terms of the participation agreement signed by defendant and his awareness of his responsibilities in that regard, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s conclusion that defendant willfully violated the agreement.

"Appeal from a judgment of the Albany County Court, rendered November 9, 1972, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree. Defendant pied guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree- in violation of section 220.10 of the Penal Law. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term not to exceed four years. Defendant raises two issues on this appeal. First, that the testimony produced at the suppression hearing failed to establish either actual or constructive possession of a dangerous drug, and second, that the sentence was unduly harsh. The record reveals that defendant occupied an apartment on the tenth floor of a hotel; that the People had obtained a search warrant to search, among other places, that apartment; that one of the officers assigned to the ease observed defendant get out of an elevator on the tenth floor and place a brown paper bag into the base of a floor-type ashtray. This bag was later removed by the officer and found, on examination, to contain heroin. There was also testimony that a search of defendant’s apartment produced certain “ drug paraphenalia ”. Defendant contends, among other things, that the proof establishes that there were times when there was no one watching the ashtray and this constitutes a fatal defect in the proof. An examination of the record in its entirety clearly supports a conclusion that defendant exercised sufficient control over the heroin to constitute constructive possession (People v. Diaz, 41 A D 2d 382). Consequently, we agree with the conclusion of the trial court. While the sentence was the maximum allowed, it was within the statutory limits. The court had the benefit of a sentencing memorandum submitted on behalf of the defendant. The sentence was within the sound discretion of the court, and we do not find it excessive.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Halloran, J.), rendered November 17, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty of the reduced charge of attempted , criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Defendant also waived the right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain and now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in' accepting his plea.
According to defendant, County Court should not have accepted his plea without first making an inquiry concerning the basis of defendant’s request for new assigned counsel. To the extent that defendant’s claim raises an issue regarding the voluntariness of his plea, that issue has not been preserved for our review as a result of defendant’s failure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment (see, e.g., People v Ferreri, 271 AD2d 805, lv denied 95 NY2d 834). To the extent that the claim is based upon the constitutional right to counsel of one’s own choosing, and assuming without deciding that such a claim was not encompassed by defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Boyer, 237 AD2d 743, 744, lv denied 90 NY2d 855), the record does not support defendant’s claim.
During plea negotiations on the eve of trial, defendant apparently refused to speak to assigned counsel and made some comments about new counsel. County Court conducted a proceeding on the record to advise defendant that a change in counsel would not delay the trial and that defendant’s options were to accept the plea offer or proceed to trial. During the proceeding, defendant’s only complaint was that “I’ve been incarcerated for eleven months now and I haven’t seen an attorney till yesterday on this case.” Inasmuch as defendant had appeared with assigned counsel for a suppression hearing less than three months earlier, the claim was clearly specious. With regard to new counsel, the court stated: “You can get a new attorney if the proper [paperwork is] done, but he’s got to be ready to start this trial at 9:30 tomorrow morning.” The court then adjourned the proceeding with instructions to assigned counsel to talk with defendant about the options.
Defendant thereafter returned for a plea proceeding during which he consulted with assigned counsel several times and entered a knowing and voluntary plea to a reduced charge. He made no request for new counsel and voiced no dissatisfaction with assigned counsel. In these circumstances, the record does not support defendant’s claim of reversible error (see, People v Smith, 231 AD2d 815).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered October 11, 1995, upon defendant’s plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea and sentencing agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to two concurrent terms of imprisonment having a minimum of 3½ and a maximum of 7 years with the alternative of enrolling in and successfully completing a 90-day drug rehabilitation program at Willard Bay Drug Treatment Facility, in which case the balance of her sentence would be served on parole. For reasons which do not appear in the record, defendant did not complete the Willard program and is thus serving the original sentence imposed.
Defendant contends on this appeal that her plea agreement was involuntary in that when it was made she lacked sufficient information and understanding of the nature of the drug treatment program to make an informed acceptance of the plea and sentencing options. She further contends that the People breached their agreement to afford her the opportunity to complete an appropriate drug treatment program and that her sentence was otherwise harsh and excessive.
Defendant’s arguments are premised on facts and events not contained in the record, which concludes with the sentencing on October 11, 1995. Whether she entered the program or why she failed to complete it is not a matter of record. We cannot review that which is not before us or speculate on matters as to which there is no proof. Defendant’s contentions, with the requisite supporting material, would properly be the subject of a CPL article 440 motion. Nor can we say that defendant’s sentence is harsh or excessive, given the original charges. The terms of the sentence were clearly set forth on the record at the time of the plea and at sentencing, and defendant acknowledged that she was satisfied with same.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered October 19, 2012 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment and waived his right to appeal. As part of his negotiated plea, defendant signed a stipulation forfeiting $337,720 that was allegedly seized in relation to the crimes charged. Sentenced pursuant to his plea agreement to a prison term of eight years with two years of postrelease supervision, defendant now appeals.
Defendant initially contends that his plea was not voluntary, as he was rushed into agreeing to its terms without fully understanding the rights that he was giving up or the ultimate consequences of the plea. This contention is unpreserved for our review, given defendant’s failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Royce, 122 AD3d 1008, 1009 [2014]; People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]). In any event, the transcript of the plea colloquy establishes that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pleaded guilty, after being provided with sufficient time to discuss the plea with his counsel and to consider its implications (see People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [Apr. 9, 2015]; People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1229-1230 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [Apr. 23, 2015]). Defendant further contends that he did not understand the consequences of his appeal waiver and it is therefore invalid. While defendant was not required to preserve his challenge to the voluntariness of his appeal waiver (see People v Crump, 107 AD3d 1046, 1046-1047 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1014 [2013]), we conclude that defendant likewise knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal, and that he understood the consequences of the waiver (see People v Kormos, 126 AD3d 1039, 1039 [2015]; People v Sibounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1059-1060 [2015]).
We also find without merit defendant’s argument that the funds forfeited as part of his guilty plea should be returned to him due to the People’s failure to follow the procedure required by Penal Law § 480.10. As an initial matter, defendant’s challenge to the forfeiture is waived both by his written forfeiture stipulation and his valid appeal waiver (see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2012]; People v Sczepankowski, 293 AD2d 212, 214-215 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 564 [2002]; see also People v Abruzzese, 30 AD3d 219, 220 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 784 [2006]). Furthermore, defendant incorrectly argues that this is a criminal forfeiture pursuant to Penal Law § 480.10, although he was clearly advised during his plea colloquy of the civil nature of the forfeiture and he stipulated to a release of the subject funds pursuant to CPLR article 13-A as a negotiated aspect of his plea agreement (see CPL 220.50 [6]; People v Carmichael, 123 AD3d 1053, 1053 [2014]). Finally, “[d]efendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes his argument [ ] that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive” (People v Toback, 125 AD3d at 1061; see People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered February 19, 2016, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a waiver of appeal. Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court imposed a one-year term of interim probation supervision and ordered defendant to comply with the terms and conditions thereof, warning him that, if he violated the conditions, he faced up to eight years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. In August 2014, following a hearing, County Court found that defendant had violated the terms of interim probation and resentenced him to an additional year of interim probation. In March 2015, defendant was indicted on various drug charges and ultimately convicted of six felonies in January 2016. As a result, County Court found that defendant had again failed to comply with the conditions of his interim probation and sentenced him, as a second felony drug offender, to a five-year prison term to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that his combined oral and written waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). The plea minutes demonstrate that defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea and that he understood and voluntarily agreed to this condition, and County Court made clear that the waiver of appeal was separate and distinct from the trial-related rights that he automatically forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Belile, 137 AD3d 1460, 1461 [2016]). Defendant then signed a detailed written waiver in open court that outlined his rights and the consequences of the waiver, that specifically waived his right to challenge the severity of the sentence and that indicated that defendant had discussed the waiver with counsel and understood it. Accordingly, defendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive given that he was informed of the sentence that could be imposed if he did not successfully complete the term of interim probation (see People v Tulip, 150 AD3d 1564, 1565-1566 [2017]; People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Best, J.), rendered April 19, 1985, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In August 1984, defendant was charged with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following a Huntley hearing on February 1, 1985, County Court denied a motion to suppress defendant’s written statement and certain physical evidence. Plea negotiations began after the commencement of jury selection on February 19, 1985. The prosecution started its case on February 21, 1985. On March 1, 1985, after a week of trial, the prosecution called Michael Melvin Ackerman as a rebuttal witness. His testimony was objected to by defendant because Ackerman had not been listed on the prosecution’s witness list. After hearing defense counsel on this witness’s eligibility to testify and before making a decision thereon, County Court was approached by the parties with a plea bargain arrangement. This arrangement required defendant to plead guilty to a class B felony charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with a ""clear allocution of the B felony and the crime” and with defendant ""withdrawing * * * all motions and objections”. In exchange for his plea, defendant was to be sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 9 years. The prosecution was required to disclose Ackerman’s testimony by an offer of proof, since Ackerman had not yet testified. After the prosecution did so, defendant, with his attorney present, pleaded guilty to the second count of the indictment and placed the plea agreement on the record. Specifically, defendant stated that he would withdraw all of his motions and objections, that he understood that his plea waived certain of his legal defenses including entrapment, and that the plea was entered into expressly and affirmatively after consultation with counsel. Defendant then admitted the underlying facts of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.
Pursuant to County Court’s direction, defendant appeared for sentencing on March 27, 1985. Inasmuch as a confidential informant for the People, Donald Warner, had appeared before the court on his own initiative that morning and had made an unsworn statement, defense counsel was given an adjournment to assess the impact of Warner’s statement. On April 19, 1985, defendant and his counsel again appeared for sentencing and at this time defense counsel made a lengthy oral motion to withdraw defendant’s plea on the basis of the unsworn statement of Warner and on the offer of proof of Ackerman. Based on the plea bargain and its conclusion that defense counsel had always had access to the witness Warner and that the subsequent unsworn statement of Warner did not substantially alter his trial testimony, and because any objection thereto had been waived by the plea, County Court denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. After affording defendant the opportunity to speak on his own behalf, which was declined, the court sentenced defendant to the term promised.
We affirm. Defendant’s knowing and intelligent plea waived all the factual defenses he could have interposed at trial (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1), including the defense of entrapment (see, People v Richards, 89 AD2d 1043). The plea agreement was favorable to defendant (see, People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 353, cert denied sub nom. Robinson v New York, 393 US 1067), who could have received 8 Vs to 25 years in prison for a conviction of each of the class B felony charges and 8Vs years to life on the class A-l felony charge.
Furthermore, in our view, despite ample opportunity to be heard on the withdrawal of his plea (see, People v Luke UU., 99 AD2d 881), defendant never protested his innocence (see, People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55, 57; People v Johnson, 91 AD2d 782, 783) or complained of the adequacy of his counsel (see, People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940, 941) or the excessiveness of his sentence (see, People v Nixon, supra). Instead, he fully and frankly admitted his guilt of the crime to which he pleaded guilty without indicating any ""trigger” requiring the court to make further inquiry in regard thereto. Therefore, County Court properly exercised its discretion in summarily denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (cf. People v Brockway, 88 AD2d 1039), since there was no adequate basis for the withdrawal motion (see, People v Johnson, supra). The judgment of conviction should in all respects be affirmed.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Cassidy, J.), rendered October 29, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of forgery in the second degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered May 12, 2015, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
In satisfaction of a five-count indictment stemming from defendant’s use of a stolen credit card to make unauthorized purchases at two convenience stores, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of forgery in the second degree, admitting that he signed the cardholder’s name without permission. The plea agreement provided that defendant would successfully complete drug treatment and then enter the Judicial Diversion Program (hereinafter JDP) (see CPL 216.05) and that, upon his successful completion of the JDP, he could withdraw his guilty plea and enter a plea to a misdemeanor. The agreement contemplated that if defendant failed to abide by the conditions of the JDP, he could be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term up to 3V2 to 7 years. Pursuant to the agreement, defendant signed a plea memorandum outlining those plea terms, admitted his predicate felony and agreed to waive his right to appeal. He successfully completed substance abuse treatment, was accepted into the JDP and signed a JDP contract. In September 2014, defendant admitted that he had absconded from the drug court program and violated the JDP contract conditions by failing to report to drug court and by using drugs. County Court terminated him from the JDP and imposed a prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. Defendant’s subsequent motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment was denied. Defendant now appeals from the judgment and, with permission, from the order denying his motion to vacate.
Defendant’s contention that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, which survives the unchallenged appeal waiver (see People v Moulton, 134 AD3d 1251, 1252 [2015]), was not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion pursuant to CPL 220.60 (3), despite ample opportunity to do so within the many months between his guilty plea and sentencing (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1471 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1162 [2015]; see also People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 363-364 [2013]; People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182 [2013]). A review of the plea allocution discloses that defendant did not say anything that raised significant doubt as to his guilt or called into question the voluntariness of his guilty plea so as to bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-666 [1988]; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d at 1231; see also People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 220 [2016]).
Next, defendant’s motion to vacate the judgment was premised upon the claim that, as relevant here, his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, in that counsel failed to disclose to him (or the prosecutor) that a witness had signed an exculpatory affidavit prior to his guilty plea. Specifically, the witness asserted that she had reviewed a photo supplied by the People, taken from the convenience store surveillance video, and that the woman depicted therein was her but that the man next to her in the photo was not defendant, who she knew, and that she did not witness him use a stolen credit card on that day. Initially, while defendant claimed in his affidavit in support of the motion that counsel did not disclose the affidavit to him, he did not allege that he was unaware of it, and his letter to counsel submitted in support of the motion suggests that he was aware of it. Even assuming that defendant was unaware of the affidavit, a letter to defendant from defense counsel explained that the purpose of the affidavit was to impeach the witness if she were called by the People to testify; as the charges were resolved with a plea, there was no need to admit the affidavit into evidence. Notably, two police officers identified defendant as the person in the surveillance video and, when confronted with pictures taken from that video, defendant admitted that it was him depicted in that video and that he had made purchases at the convenience store that day, and he later disclosed that he had obtained the credit card from “a girl.” In view of this strong evidence of guilt, and given that the record establishes that defendant received a favorable plea agreement that would have allowed him to avoid a felony conviction and prison had he complied with the drug court conditions, we are unpersuaded that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary due to any ineffective assistance of counsel or that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about the affidavit (see People v Soprano, 135 AD3d 1243, 1243 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1007 [2016]; People v Gonzalez, 130 AD3d 1089, 1090 [2015]). Accordingly, County Court properly denied defendant’s motion to vacate premised upon CPL 440.10 (1) (h).

The evidence established that defense counsel had informed the prosecutor about this affidavit.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered February 28, 2006, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court (Herrick, J.), rendered February 28, 2006, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged with various crimes in two separate indictments. She pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the second indictment. Her subsequent motion to withdraw her pleas was denied and she was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 3 to 6 years for the criminal sede conviction and 2 to 4 years for the criminal possession conviction. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant maintains that, because of her history of mental health problems, County Court erred, first, in accepting her guilty pleas and, second, in denying her motion to withdraw the pleas. A review of the record confirms that County Court was aware of defendant’s mental health condition and, as a result, engaged in a thorough colloquy during each allocution, ensuring that defendant understood the nature of the charges, her rights and the consequences of pleading guilty. Defendant, in turn, expressed her full comprehension, freely admitted the facts underlying the respective crimes and pleaded guilty thereto. Under these circumstances, we find that defendant’s guilty pleas were knowing, intelligent and voluntary and, as such, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to withdraw the pleas (see People v Lawrence, 34 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]).
Defendant also contends that her sentences are harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant’s appeal waivers were invalid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]), her contention is properly before us. However, nothing in the record demonstrates an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court or the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences (see People v Lowe, 34 AD3d 979, 980-981 [2006]; People v Thompson, 33 AD3d 1131,1131 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schoharie County (Lament, J.), rendered December 22, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of assault in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree in satisfaction of a multicount superior court information, waiving his right to appeal. When the plea was entered, County Court agreed to impose a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probationary supervision. The commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant’s committing no Penal Law violations before the sentencing date. In the interim, however, defendant was arrested on a new charge. Defendant then agreed upon a disposition involving the new charge and a revised sentencing commitment on the assault charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the new charges, waiving his right to appeal, and was subsequently sentenced to negotiated concurrent terms of 1 to 3 years in prison on the assault conviction and 2 to 6 years on the drug charge. He now appeals, challenging the validity and severity of the sentences imposed.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s arguments, County Court did not err in imposing a more severe sentence on the assault charge upon defendant’s breach of the conditional sentencing agreement (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718). County Court clearly indicated that its original sentence commitment was conditional and, in the event one of the conditions were breached, it would not be bound by its sentencing commitment but that defendant would still “stand convicted”. We note that at no time did defendant seek vacatur of his guilty plea on the assault charge or deny commission of the new offense, to which he also pleaded guilty. Thus, there is no merit to his contention that the court erred in not conducting a summary hearing (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713).
Finally, even if defendant had not knowingly waived his right to appeal in the context of his guilty pleas (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032), we would nevertheless find his claim that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive to be without merit in light of his prior criminal history and the nature of the crimes.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered June 15,1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a 12-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The plea was entered with the express understanding that defendant was waiving his right to appeal and would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 71h to 15 years. Having been sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, defendant now appeals contending that he did not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waive his right to appeal and that his sentence is harsh and excessive. We affirm.
Upon our review of the plea allocution, we find that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal and such waiver will be enforced (see, e.g., People v Sledge, 195 AD2d 713, lv denied 82 NY2d 903). We find equally unavailing defendant’s contention that the agreed-upon sentence, which is within the statutory guidelines, is harsh and excessive. Defendant has shown neither extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of County Court’s discretion to warrant modification of this sentence in the interest of justice (see, e.g., People v Gaddy, 191 AD2d 735, 736, lv denied 82 NY2d 718); accordingly, we decline to disturb it.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered September 22, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a nine-count indictment and waived his right to appeal. County Court denied defendant’s request to be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to five years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Defendant does not challenge the validity of his appeal waiver, and the plea colloquy and the written waiver demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and-sentence (see People v White, 145 AD3d 1324, 1324-1325 [2016]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]). As such, defendant’s valid waiver of appeal precludes his contentions that County Court abused its discretion in denying him youthful offender status and that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive (see People v Pacherille, 25 NY3d 1021, 1024 [2015]; People v Simon, 140 AD3d 1533, 1534 [2016]; People v Hernandez, 140 AD3d 1521, 1523 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 971 [2016]; People v Wright, 123 AD3d 1241, 1241 [2014]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered December 17, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered May 30, 2014, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
In April 2012, defendant was indicted and charged with two counts each of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree, as well as one count of unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree, all stemming from two alleged drug transactions in the City of Glens Falls, Warren County. In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant thereafter moved, pursuant to CPL 440.10, to vacate the judgment on the basis of, among other things, the ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, with permission, from the order denying his postconviction motion.
Initially, defendant’s unchallenged waiver of appeal precludes his contention that the grand jury minutes were deficient on the basis that the People may have failed to instruct the grand jury on the agency defense (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]), as well as his claim that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Toback, 125 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 993 [2015]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2014]).
While portions of defendant’s claim that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective survive his guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Casey, 95 NY2d 354, 363 [2000]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1265-1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]), they are without merit. Specifically, “where an indictment count incorporates by reference the statutory provision applicable to the crime intended to be charged, it has been repeatedly held that this is sufficient to apprise the defendant of the charge and, therefore, renders the count jurisdictionally valid” (People v Moon, 119 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1004 [2014] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]). Here, because counts two and seven of the indictment — i.e., the counts to which defendant pleaded guilty — recite, among other things, the specific section of the Penal Law under which defendant was charged, those counts of the indictment were not jurisdictionally defective (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1023-1024 [2013]; People v Motz, 52 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 791 [2008]). Moreover, although the People concede that the two counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree are jurisdiction-ally defective, defects contained in the counts to which defendant did not plead guilty constitute mere technical flaws that are precluded by defendant’s waiver of appeal (see People v Olmstead, 111 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2013]; People v Maye, 69 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 807 [2010]).
Defendant next asserts that his plea should be vacated because the People breached their promise to make County Court aware of his cooperation and recommend a lower sentence. Although this contention is not precluded by defendant’s waiver of appeal (see People v Dame, 100 AD3d 1032, 1034 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]; People v Carter, 64 AD3d 1089, 1091 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 835 [2009]), it nonetheless evades our review inasmuch as defendant failed to properly preserve the argument with a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Parsons, 3 AD3d 790, 791 [2004]). In any event, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the agreed-upon plea bargain.
However, we do agree with defendant’s contention that remittal to County Court is required inasmuch as his CPL 440.10 motion was improperly denied without a hearing, as defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are based upon matters not apparent on the face of the record (compare CPL 440.30; People v Satterfield 66 NY2d 796, 799 [1985]). Specifically, defendant’s pro se motion to vacate the judgment of conviction contains sworn allegations of ineffective assistance based upon counsel’s failure to engage in discovery or motion practice and counsel pressuring him to accept the plea offered by the People, as well as arguments that we construe to implicate the voluntariness of defendant’s plea. The People opposed defendant’s application, by way of letter, solely on the basis that a direct appeal was already pending (see CPL 440.10 [2] [b]) and provided no additional documentary proof regarding the substance of defendant’s allegations. County Court agreed with the People and denied the motion without a hearing.
The record before us contains no motions or discovery, and the reason for their absence is not apparent. We are able to ascertain only the following from the record. In June 2012, at arraignment on the indictment, defendant signed a preplea waiver — also absent from the record and, notably, innocuously referred to by County Court as “the yellow sheet” — permitting a preplea investigation by the Probation Department and a report to be sent to County Court. We are unable to determine whether counsel was present with defendant during his interview with the Probation Department. Two months later, defendant wrote to County Court expressing his dissatisfaction with counsel — a complaint that, at least according to this record, remains substantively unaddressed prior to defendant’s plea in September 2012. Two days shy of one year following his arraignment, defendant was finally sentenced and a subsequent letter from defense counsel to defendant appears in the file, which profoundly misstates the facts and circumstances surrounding defendant’s plea, among other things, as we otherwise know them. Inasmuch as there is no factual record of defendant’s claims, we are powerless to properly address them. Therefore, upon the record before us, we are of the view that a hearing should have been held on his CPL 440.10 motion to determine the validity of defendant’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.
Thus, the matter must be remitted to County Court for a hearing on defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Furthermore, because defendant’s arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal likewise concern matters outside the record, these claims are more properly the subject of a postconviction motion (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]; People v Jenkins, 130 AD3d 1091, 1092 [2015]; People v Green, 9 AD3d 687, 688 [2004]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of IV2 to 4V2 years. Defendant appeals, contending that because this is her first felony conviction, the sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. While the sentence imposed by County Court was slightly more severe than the statutory minimum sentence of 1 to 3 years (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]), it was less than the negotiated maximum of 2 to 6 years. This, together with the lack of any evidence of extraordinary circumstances meriting a reduction, lead us to conclude that the sentence imposed by County Court should not be disturbed (see, People v Hayes, 236 AD2d 738, lv denied 89 NY2d 1094; People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893).

Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentences imposed upon the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree to 7V2 to 15 years; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove his identify as the seller is unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10; People v Udzinski, 146 AD2d 245). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]). The evidence adduced at trial clearly established that the defendant sold cocaine to Detective DeMato on October 15, 1994.
The sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated.

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that the prison sentence she received of five years to life upon her plea of guilty is harsh and excessive. In rejecting this argument, we note that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines, that the plea was in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment and that the sentence was in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Bauer, 153 AD2d 988, lv denied 75 NY2d 767; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Finally, we have previously determined that a person’s affliction with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting interference with the sentence imposed (see, People v Brandow, 139 AD2d 819, lv denied 72 NY2d 856).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered January 23, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree. He also waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to two years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. County Court agreed to release defendant on his own recognizance pending sentencing and advised him that if he violated the conditions of his release, which included testing positive for the use of drugs, the court would not be bound by the sentencing commitment and could sentence him to 2V2 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, defendant tested positive for drug use and County Court sentenced him to 2V2 years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, defendant contends that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he was not advised of potential sentencing consequences prior to entering his plea. Defendant, however, is foreclosed from raising this claim as it does not appear from the record that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Buck, 136 AD3d 1117, 1118 [2016]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]). Moreover, we do not find that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable here given that defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that negated his guilt (see People v Buck, 136 AD3d at 1118; People v Butler, 134 AD3d at 1350). Defendant’s alternative argument that his sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal as County Court advised him of the consequences of violating the release conditions as well as the maximum sentence that could be imposed (see People v Perkins, 125 AD3d 1045, 1047 [2015]; People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 935 [2015]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered August 10, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment with the commitment to a sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to cooperate in the prosecution of a codefendant and was to be “debriefed by the authorities.” Finally, County Court admonished defendant that his failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement would relieve the court of its sentencing commitment and subject defendant to an enhanced sentence of up to 3½ to 7 years in prison.
Upon defendant’s appearance for sentencing, the People advised County Court that he had not fulfilled his obligation to cooperate with the prosecution, as the result of which the People requested an enhanced sentence. County Court advised defen-
dant that he had a right to a hearing, at which time the People bore the burden of proving that defendant had failed to comply with the plea agreement. As an alternative, the court offered defendant an enhanced sentence of 2½ to 5 years in prison. Defendant declined the hearing and accepted the court’s proposed enhanced sentence. As a consequence, County Court imposed the enhanced sentence of 2½ to 5 years in prison and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we note that defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and consequently has not preserved the issue of the propriety of his sentence for our review (see e.g. People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790-791 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]). In any event, were we to consider defendant’s claim that his enhanced sentence constituted reversible error, we would find his contention without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered December 3, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment and other unindicted crimes, along with the promise that there would be no federal prosecution in connection with those matters, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court committed to sentencing defendant to no greater than nine years in prison, together with a period of postrelease supervision. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as negotiated to an aggregate prison term of nine years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision.
Defendant’s sole contention on this appeal is that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced. We disagree. Having reviewed the record, and specifically noting the seriousness of the crimes to which defendant pleaded guilty, we discern neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of any extraordinary circuftistances warranting a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Gillespie, 19 AD3d 878 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered January 14, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In July 2010, defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The charges stemmed from allegations that defendant twice sold cocaine to a confidential informant. After conducting a Wade hearing, County Court concluded that the identification procedure employed by the police in securing the confidential informant’s identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive and denied his motion to suppress. Thereafter, defendant entered a guilty plea to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived his right to appeal, and was sentenced as a second felony offender — in accord with the plea agreement — to 4V2 years in prison, plus two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court improperly denied his motion to suppress, his plea allocution was factually insufficient, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Defendant’s challenge to County Court’s denial of his motion to suppress is precluded by his waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Spruill, 90 AD3d 1242, 1243 [2011]; People v Ballard, 88 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 955 [2012]). Defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his guilty plea is also barred by the appeal waiver and, moreover, is unpreserved as there is no indication on this record that he moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Taylor, 89 AD3d 1143, 1143 [2011]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1317-1318 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1292 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]).
As for defendant’s claim regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, he argues that trial counsel should have moved to suppress audiotapes made by the confidential informant when the sales allegedly took place and maintains that the specter of those tapes being used as evidence against him impacted the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Assuming that counsel’s failure to make such a motion could raise a question regarding the voluntariness of defendant’s guilty plea (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2010]), he has not preserved this issue because he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Irvis, 90 AD3d 1302, 1304 [2011]; People v Cassara, 88 AD3d 1069, 1069 [2011]). In any event, the record establishes that defendant obtained a favorable plea agreement, stated during his plea allocution that he was satisfied with counsel’s efforts on his behalf and acknowledged having ample time to discuss with counsel the terms of the guilty plea before entering it. Therefore, were we to reach the issue we would find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Gentry, 73 AD3d at 1384).
Finally, defendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes any claim that his sentence was harsh or excessive (see People v Jones, 88 AD3d 1029 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 859 [2011]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d at 1292).

Defendant does not challenge the validity of the waiver of his right to appeal and, upon our review, we find it was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Ballard, 88 AD3d at 1026).",,644,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him as a second felony drug offender to a prison term of eight years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant claims that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel in that he was not advised of statutory changes, enacted shortly before his sentencing, that lowered the minimum permissible prison term in his case (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i]; see also L 2009, ch 56, part AAA, §§ 23, 33 [f]). While his argument survives his appeal waiver to the extent that it implicates the voluntariness of his plea, it is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Olmstead, 77 AD3d 1179, 1181 [2010]; People v Peterkin, 77 AD3d 1017 [2010]). In any event, defendant has an extensive criminal history and was sentenced to a prison term well above either the pre- or postamendment minimum, and counsel’s alleged failure to consider the amendment did not deprive defendant of meaningful representation (see People v Modica, 64 NY2d 828, 829 [1985]; People v Palma, 305 AD2d 333, 334 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 644 [2003]).
Defendant’s challenge to the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea is similarly unpreserved for our review, and he made no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Martinez, 79 AD3d 1378, 1378-1379 [2010]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). His valid appeal waiver forecloses his remaining attack upon the agreed-upon sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385).

"—Appeals from two judgments of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered October 20, 1997, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged by indictment and superior court information with committing two separate crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On June 23, 1995, defendant agreed to plead guilty to both crimes in exchange for County Court’s commitment that he would receive concurrent terms of 3 to 9 years in prison. Defendant was allowed to be released on his own recognizance for two weeks, but, prior to doing so, County Court made it clear that the sentence commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant appearing on the date set for sentencing. County Court specifically stated that, if defendant did not appear as scheduled, he would in effect be granting the court “permission to sentence [him] to anything the law would allow”. Thereafter, defendant did not appear for sentencing and, when he was returned to court on a warrant two years later, County Court sentenced defendant to two consecutive prison terms of 6 to 18 years. This appeal followed.
We affirm. Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that County Court erred in not allowing him to withdraw his guilty pleas prior to imposition of the enhanced sentences. Defendant’s argument in this regard is premised upon a discussion made in the context of a prior plea offer made before the superior court information was issued which defendant ultimately rejected. An examination of County Court’s remarks on that date establishes that any promises made were tied to the rejected offer. Significantly, no mention of a possible withdrawal of the pleas was made with respect to the consequences if defendant violated any of the conditions set by the court (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, Iv denied 82 NY2d 718). Instead, defendant was informed by County Court that the consequence for breach of the requirement that he appear for the scheduled sentencing date would be an enhanced sentence (see, id.; see also, People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854). Since defendant violated the terms of the agreement by his nonappearance, a lengthier sentence was justified (see, People v Waldron, 257 AD2d 771).
Finally, we have examined defendant’s argument that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, and find it to be without merit given defendant’s considerable criminal history and the particular circumstances involved here (see, id.).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, J.), rendered January 17, 2007, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison. On the occasion of his first appeal, defendant’s sentence was vacated due to the People’s failure to file a second felony offender statement as required by CPL 400.21 (8 AD3d 904 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]). Upon remittal for resentencing, the People submitted the requisite second felony offender statement and defendant admitted the allegations contained therein. Defendant, however, also informed County Court, through counsel, that he “intends to challenge the constitutionality of the conviction . . . just acknowledged” (30 AD3d 897 [2006]), but County Court made no further inquiry into defendant’s assertion and resentenced him, as a second felony offender, to 5 to 10 years in prison. Due to County Court’s failure to inquire into the nature of defendant’s challenge or afford him the opportunity to explain it, the matter was again remitted to County Court for redetermination of his second felony offender status and resentencing (id.).
Upon remittal, County Court convened a hearing into defendant’s second felony offender status and defendant’s challenge to the constitutionality of his prior conviction. In the papers submitted to County Court, defendant asserted that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel during the prosecution of his previous felony conviction. Following the hearing, County Court determined that defendant received the effective assistance of counsel on the occasion of his previous conviction and thereafter resentenced him to 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Pursuant to CPL 400.21, the People bear the initial burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a previous felony conviction (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15 [1983]). “Once the fact of the prior conviction has been established, it is then incumbent upon the defendant to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim that the conviction was unconstitutionally obtained” (id. [citation omitted]). Here, the certificate of conviction filed by the People—and received without objection—satisfied their burden of proving the existence of the previous felony conviction. The burden was then upon defendant to allege and prove that his previous conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Upon review of the record, the only basis for defendant’s claim warranting extended discussion is his assertion that he informed counsel of his desire to file an appeal but no appeal was filed. In support of this claim, defendant presented only an assertion in an affidavit that he was informed of his right to appeal by County Court and that “even though [defendant] told [counsel] [he] wanted to appeal, [counsel] did not file a Notice of Appeal.” Defendant presented no other proof and, although County Court offered him the opportunity to do so, he declined to take the stand at the hearing, or to call witnesses or present any other proof. Under these circumstances, we find defendant’s self-serving affidavit, without more, insufficient to satisfy his burden and overcome “the presumptions of the validity and regularity of the previous felony conviction []” (id. at 16; see People v Wheeler, 7 AD3d 281, 281 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 683 [2004]).
Furthermore, we note that there is no evidence in the record that, once it became clear to defendant that his attorney had not filed a notice of appeal of the conviction at issue—the right to which defendant admits he was informed by County Court, along with the 30-day time limit—defendant made any effort to pursue an appeal, including by request for an extension of the time to file pursuant to CPL 460.30. Such circumstance limits the persuasiveness of defendant’s present assertion that he wanted to appeal his conviction and that he communicated this desire to counsel, and that, as a result, his counsel was ineffective (see People v McDonough, 87 AD2d 727, 727 [1982]). Thus, inasmuch as defendant failed to prove that his previous conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, we affirm defendant’s resentence.
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered April 17, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In satisfaction of a seven-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of eight years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision.
Initially, defendant’s contentions distill to a challenge to the knowing, voluntary and intelligent nature of his plea and that the sentence imposed was not in accordance with the plea agreement. His failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders defendant’s arguments unpreserved for our review (see People v Adams, 26 AD3d 597, 598 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 751 [2006]; People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841, 842 [1993]). In any event, were we to reach these issues, we would find them without merit. A review of the record supports the conclusion that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty with a full understanding of its consequences. Defendant’s responses to County Court’s questions belie his contention that he was rushed or misled into accepting the plea agreement (see People v Douglas, 38 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 843 [2007]). We would also find without merit defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed violated the terms of the plea agreement. The court stated that “there is a possibility, but no promise” that any cooperation by defendant in a pending federal investigation against him could favorably impact the ultimate sentence imposed in the instant matter. However, the court clearly stated that pursuant to the plea agreement defendant could receive eight years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision.
Likewise, defendant failed to preserve his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and nothing suggests that the alleged “careless representation at sentencing” impacted the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Justice, 283 AD2d 665 [2001]). Finally, given defendant’s criminal history, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s argument that the bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Sherald, 45 AD3d 973 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 771 [2008]; People v Guillermo, 254 AD2d 527, 528 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 1032 [1998]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered October 30, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was charged in an eight-count indictment with various drug-related crimes. He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. Thereafter, he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to four years to life in prison. He now appeals.
Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of representing defendant on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, however, has filed a pro se brief raising issues of the voluntariness of the plea, the effectiveness of counsel and the severity of the sentence. Initially, we note that defendant’s challenges to the voluntariness of the plea and the effectiveness of counsel are not preserved for our review given defendant’s failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914 [2003]; People v Angus, 303 AD2d 829, 829 [2003]). His challenge to the severity of the sentence is likewise precluded by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Young, 302 AD2d 798, 799 [2003]). In any event, were we to address the merits of these claims, we would find no “arguable merit” warranting the assignment of new counsel to pursue such issues on appeal (cf. People v Gilliam, 281 AD2d 657, 657 [2001]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 801 [2001]).

"Peters, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered February 14, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a one-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, County Court agreed to place defendant on interim probation for a period of one year and explained that, if successful, he would be sentenced to felony probation. Defendant was advised, however, that if he failed to abide by the terms of his interim probation, he could be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to as much as four years in prison. County Court thereafter placed defendant on interim probation and sentencing was adjourned to January 2014.
In January 2014, defendant was charged with violating the terms of his probation by consuming alcohol and being arrested for a new crime. Defendant then appeared before County Court for sentencing and was sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he was not advised of the mandatory postrelease supervision component of his sentence.
We reverse. Initially, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his otherwise valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Bolivar, 118 AD3d 91, 93 [2014]; People v Brown, 107 AD3d 1303, 1304 [2013]). Moreover, it was not necessary for defendant to preserve his challenge to the imposition of postrelease supervision under these circumstances (see People v Turner, 24 NY3d 254, 258 [2014]; People v Cornell, 16 NY3d 801, 802 [2011]; People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]). Turning to the merits, it is well settled that, for a defendant’s plea to be knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered into, a court must advise him or her of the direct consequences of a plea prior to sentencing, including the existence and duration of any postrelease supervision requirement (see People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; People v Brewington, 127 AD3d 1248, 1249 [2015]; People v Thomas, 68 AD3d 1445, 1446-1447 [2009]). Here, as the People concede, at the time of his plea, defendant was not properly made aware of the postrelease supervision component of his sentence. Accordingly, defendant’s decision to plead guilty was not a knowing, voluntary and intelligent one and, therefore, the judgment of conviction must be reversed (see People v Brown, 107 AD3d at 1304).
In light of this result, we need not reach defendant’s alternative claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that his sentence of three concurrent prison terms of 3 to 9 years was harsh and excessive. Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that the sentence ultimately imposed was the most lenient allowed under the terms of the plea arrangement. Given this fact, and the fact that the sentence imposed is less than the harshest possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Maye, 143 AD2d 483, lv denied 73 NY2d 788; People v Smith, 141 AD2d 988).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered October 26, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of two indictments and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant appeals contending that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
We affirm.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered December 7, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was arrested after he sold cocaine to a confidential informant and undercover police officer. Thereafter, in satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision and restitution in the amount of $200. This appeal followed.
Defendant’s sole contention is that his sentence is harsh and excessive and that he should have been directed to participate in a drug treatment program. Upon our review, we find this contention to be unpersuasive. The record demonstrates that defendant has had many opportunities to address the substance addiction he claims is the underlying cause of his criminal conduct and has not done so. Under the circumstances, “we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice” (People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]; see People v Lasanta, 89 AD3d 1324 [2011]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Catena, J.), rendered March 19, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant, waiving his right to appeal, pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to six months in jail and five years’ probation. In addition to the Parker admonishment executed by defendant, County Court advised defendant that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if he did not appear for sentencing, in which case the court could impose the maximum sentence of 2Vs to 7 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant failed to appear for sentencing scheduled in August 2000 and a bench warrant was issued. Following a felony arrest in March 2002, defendant was returned to court and sentenced to 2 to 6 years in prison. Defendant appeals claiming that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is not preserved for our review given his waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Terry, 300 AD2d 757 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 620 [2003]). Were we to consider defendant’s argument, we would find it to be without merit. Given defendant’s failure to abide by the terms of the Parker admonish ment without an exculpatory reason and his intervening felony arrest, County Court was free to impose the enhanced sentence (see People v Miley, 302 AD2d 796 [2003], lvs denied 100 NY2d 540, 543 [2003]). In addition, inasmuch as the record establishes that the court considered the relevant factors prior to imposing the sentence, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see id.).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered January 12, 1987, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted conspiracy in the second degree.
Defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the crime of attempted conspiracy in the second degree, a class C felony, in full satisfaction of an indictment charging him and others with five class B felonies, two class A misdemeanors and one class B misdemeanor, arising out of the sale of cocaine. The crime of which he was convicted is punishable by a maximum term of 5 to 15 years’ imprisonment. Defendant, who received no promises regarding the sentence to be imposed, was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 12 years on his plea.
During the plea allocution, defendant admitted that he intended to ""sell” or ""distribute” the cocaine. We consider that admission sufficient to satisfy the intent element of the crime. Defendant’s contention on this appeal, that the plea allocution lacked the showing of a sufficient factual basis because it did not reveal the person or persons to whom the sale or distribution was to be made or the amount of the cocaine involved, lacks merit. Furthermore, after entering a knowing and voluntary plea, defendant does not have the right to challenge the factual basis underlying that plea (see, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97) where no impropriety is apparent in the plea (see, People v Taliaferro, 109 AD2d 943, lv denied 66 NY2d 923).
Considering the nature and number of crimes charged and the fact that defendant did not receive the maximum sentence, we do not consider the sentence excessive. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered May 19, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After selling cocaine to an undercover police officer, defendant was indicted on three counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of the indictment and waived his right to appeal from the judgment of conviction. In exchange, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a period of incarceration of 4x/2 to 9 years.
We have reviewed the record and agree with the conclusion of defense counsel that this case presents no nonfrivolous issues. The judgment should, accordingly, be affirmed and defense counsel is relieved of his assignment (see, People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Hamilton County (Feldstein, J), rendered May 9, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon term of 10 to 20 years in prison, with that sentence to run concurrently with a one-year sentence previously imposed upon defendant’s prior probation violation. Contending that he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel and that the negotiated sentence was harsh and excessive, defendant appeals.
Notably, defendant does not challenge the validity of the waiver of his right to appeal. While that waiver does not bar his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel to the extent that it relates to the voluntariness of his plea, defendant’s “failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders the claim unpreserved for our review” (People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; see People v Garcia-Toro, 42 AD3d 750, 751 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 990 [2007]; People v Morgan, 39 AD3d 889, 890 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 848 [2007]). In any event, even if the issue were properly before us, we would find it to be lacking in merit. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that defendant fully understood the rights he was relinquishing, including the right to make suppression motions, and his potential exposure relative to sentencing. He also acknowledged that he had the opportunity to confer with counsel and expressed satisfaction with counsel’s representation.
Finally, with respect to defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we note that his valid appeal waiver precludes him from raising this issue (see People v Nickell, 49 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2008]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 17, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered April 12, 2005, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, after a hearing.
In satisfaction of a 13-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and, in accordance with the plea agreement, was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a term of eight years to life and 2 to 4 years, respectively, such terms to run consecutively.
Subsequently, defendant brought on a CPL article 440 motion seeking to vacate his judgment of conviction on the ground that Judge LaBuda erred in failing to recuse himself because he had represented defendant on the prior drug charge that served as the predicate felony for sentencing purposes in the instant case. Following a hearing, defendant’s CPL article 440 motion was denied. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by leave of this Court, from the denial of his CPL article 440 motion.
We find unavailing defendant’s claim that Judge LaBuda erred by not recusing himself from presiding over the instant case. Defendant concedes that there are no statutory grounds mandating disqualification {see Judiciary Law § 14) and, thus, Judge LaBuda was the sole arbiter as to whether he should have recused himself. That decision, in turn, will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion {see People v Saunders, 301 AD2d 869, 871 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]). Simply put, disqualification is not required where a judge has represented a defendant on a prior criminal case {see People v Marrero, 30 AD3d 637, 638 [2006]) and where that case constitutes the predicate for enhanced sentencing (cfi People v Jones, 143 AD2d 465, 467 [1988]) if, as here, there is no evidence of bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge. We have considered defendant’s remaining arguments, including those set forth in his pro se brief, and find them equally unavailing.

"Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered January 14, 2010 in Albany County, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In 1992, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to I2V2 years to life in prison upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. At the same time, he was sentenced, again as a second felony of fender, to 12x/2 to 25 years in prison upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. These sentences were directed to run consecutively, resulting in defendant having to serve an aggregate term of 25 years to life in prison. Thereafter, defendant made a pro se motion for resentencing pursuant to CPL 440.46. County Court granted the motion, vacated the sentence imposed with respect to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and resentenced defendant on that crime to seven years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutively to the other sentence. Defendant appeals.
Appellate counsel has advised this Court that defendant was released from custody as a result of the resentencing on March 23, 2010. In view of this, his appeal from the resentencing is moot (see People v Messier, 43 AD3d 1205, 1206 [2007]; People v Davis, 31 AD3d 896, 897 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered May 9, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment for the People’s failure to give notice of its motion to amend the indictment to correct a typographical error, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to one year in jail and this appeal ensued.
We affirm. Initially, defendant argues that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not informed that the waiver of his right to appeal included a waiver to appeal from County Court’s ruling on the People’s motion to amend the indictment. Given that defendant failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, however, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v Smith, 248 AD2d 891, 892; People v Johnson, 243 AD2d 997, 998, lv denied 91 NY2d 926). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s contention, we would find it to be without merit inasmuch as the written waiver of appeal which defendant signed as a part of the negotiated plea agreement expressly stated that he was waiving his right to appeal from any court ruling made in connection with his case and that the waiver was voluntarily executed (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; People v Harris, 242 AD2d 782, lvs denied 91 NY2d 1004, 1008).
Finally, having entered a voluntary plea of guilty, defendant waived any alleged error made by County Court in permitting amendment of the indictment (see, People v Gauthier, 246 AD2d 928, lv denied 92 NY2d 852; People v Hunt, 148 AD2d 836, 837, lv denied 74 NY2d 665).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered January 8, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an amended indictment charging him and his wife with various crimes. Under the terms of the plea agreement that was approved by County Court, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to the minimum of six years in prison. County Court further advised defendant that his sentence would include a period of postrelease supervision, but did not specify the length. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon prison term and imposed a three-year period of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole challenge is to County Court’s imposition of a three-year period of postrelease supervision, which he contends is an abuse of discretion and is also harsh and excessive. We disagree. Given that no particular period of post-release supervision was included in the plea agreement, County Court retained the discretion to determine the length of the term and did not violate the sentencing commitment by selecting the maximum of three years. Notably, the record reveals that defendant has a lengthy criminal record, is a prior parole violator and could have been sentenced to a much lengthier prison term if convicted of the charges contained in the amended indictment. In view of this, and given that defendant was sentenced to the minimum term of imprisonment, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting modification of the period of postrelease supervision (see People v Foulkes, 117 AD3d 1176, 1177-1178 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1084 [2014]; People v Watson, 115 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Lalor, J.), rendered May 4, 2000, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Prior to the submission of the case to the grand jury, the Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case overheard defendant admit to owning the drugs in question. Recognizing that he may be called as a witness, the Assistant District Attorney recused himself from acting as trial counsel. Defendant thereafter moved to disqualify the Albany County District Attorney’s office and sought appointment of a special prosecutor, which motion was denied. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 12 to 24 years. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant contends that Supreme Court (Lament, J.) erred in denying his motion to disqualify the District Attorney’s office. We disagree. It is now well established that, absent a showing of an actual conflict of interest, the advocate-witness rule (see Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102 [a] [22 NYCRR 1200.21 (a)]) does not contemplate disqualification of an entire District Attorney’s office merely because one of the assistants will be called to testify concerning a material fact issue (see e.g. People v Keeton, 74 NY2d 903; People v Paperno, 54 NY2d 294; People v Freeman, 172 AD2d 1045, lv denied 78 NY2d 1011). As no such showing was made here, disqualification was not warranted.
Defendant also contends that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Again we disagree. While defendant points to inconsistencies regarding the People’s evidence concerning the ownership of the drugs, we need note only that the jury heard testimony that defendant admitted, on more than one occasion, that the drugs in question belonged to him. Under the circumstances, any conflict in the evidence regarding defendant’s dominion and control over the cocaine in question merely created issues of witness credibility, and the jury’s determination in that regard must be accorded great deference (see People v Montcrieft, 296 AD2d 718, 719, lv denied 98 NY2d 770). Accordingly, we are satisfied that proper weight was accorded to the record evidence by the jury. We have considered defendant’s remaining arguments and find them equally without merit.

In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with the promise of a prison term of five years followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. At sentencing, defense counsel submitted extensive information regarding defendant’s abusive childhood, long-standing drug abuse and serious physical and mental ailments. County Court observed that those circumstances would have led it to impose a lesser sentence were it not for the plea agreement. Defense counsel also recognized that the court’s “hands were tied” by the plea agreement and did not request a lesser sentence. County Court then sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the bargained-for term of imprisonment.
On appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Given County Court’s observations, we are constrained to note that it is, of course, settled law that a sentencing court retains the right, in the exercise of its discretion, to determine that a bargained-for sentence is inappropriate and is “free to impose a lesser penalty if warranted” (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 308 [1981]). Here, however, defense counsel and County Court undoubtedly were aware that if the court had agreed to impose a lesser sentence, the People would have been entitled to withdraw their consent to the plea agreement (see id. at 307-308; People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822, 823 [1989]), a possibility that defendant herself was unwilling to face. As for defendant’s contention that a reduction in the interest of justice is warranted, our review of the record does not lead us to conclude that the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant a reduction in the bargained-for sentence (see e.g. People v Brown, 3 AD3d 593 [2004]; People v Perez, 181 AD2d 922 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 836 [1992]; People v Brandow, 139 AD2d 819 [1988], lv denied 72 NY2d 856 [1988]).

"— Appeals by the defendant (1) from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (Harrington, J.), rendered September 28, 1982, convicting her of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 6 to 18 years, and (2) by permission from an order of the same court, entered January 24, 1984, which denied her motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction.
Ordered that the judgment is modified by reducing the sentence imposed to two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and it is further,
Ordered that the order is affirmed.
The errors complained of in the court’s charge are unpreserved for appellate review (CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, the record indicates that the court gave sufficient instructions on the issues of identification and alibi when the charge is read as a whole (see, People v Victor, 62 NY2d 374; People v Whalen, 59 NY2d 273; cf People v Williams, 112 AD2d 177; People v Rodriguez, 111 AD2d 881), and that the charge adequately advised the jury of the legal principles applicable to the facts of the case so that the failure of the court to marshal the evidence was not error (CPL 300.10 [2]).
Nor did the trial court err in failing to grant the defendant’s motion to sever the counts of the indictment pertaining to the sales of cocaine on June 11, 1981 and June 15, 1981, respectively. It was permissible to join the two sales since the offenses were ""the same or similar in law” (CPL 200.20 [2] [c]). The defendant’s motion was, therefore, addressed to the trial court’s discretion (CPL 200.20 [3]) and the defendant has not shown any basis upon which to conclude that the court’s exercise of discretion was abused (see, People v Jenkins, 50 NY2d 981; People v Gilmore, 106 AD2d 399, 400).
The record indicates that the defendant’s trial counsel was far from inadequate. Counsel’s pretrial Sandoval motion was granted, he vigorously cross-examined the People’s witnesses, presented five alibi witnesses, and pressed the alibi defense in a thorough summation (see, People v Davidson, 123 AD2d 782; People v Fuentes, 111 AD2d 766, 767). While the defendant’s attorney chose to fully explore the alibi defense and did not present certain other evidence available to him, we cannot say that the representation was rendered meaningless merely because his trial tactic was unsuccessful (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; cf. People v Ofunniyin, 114 AD2d 1045, 1047).
The defendant’s remaining contention with respect to trial is unpreserved and, in any event, is without merit.
Finally, the defendant’s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated. Mollen, P. J., Bracken, Brown and Spatt, JJ., concur.",,483,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered March 29, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted on charges of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree stemming from the recovery of nearly 15 pounds of marihuana from a limousine in which he had been an occupant for several hours on March 7, 2002. Following an unsuccessful motion to suppress the marihuana and his statement to police that it belonged to him, defendant, who was out on bail, absconded out of state. Ultimately, he was located and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree in satisfaction of the indictment, as well as a bail jumping charge. He waived his right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison, defendant appeals.
Defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes the claims that his suppression motion was improperly denied (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Carroll, 21 AD3d 586 [2005]), that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the suppression hearing (see People v Wright, 21 AD3d 583 [2005]; People v Carroll, supra) and that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804-805 [2004]). To the extent that defendant also challenges the voluntariness of his plea, claiming that he did not sufficiently admit to the facts underlying the crime, we note that he has failed to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction. Thus, this issue is unpreserved for our review (see People v Rivera, 20 AD3d 763, 764 [2005]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]). In any event, our review of the plea allocution satisfies us that the plea was entered knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently and that defendant’s affirmative response to County Court’s questioning established a factual basis for the crime of which he was convicted {see People v Rivera, supra; People v Mahar, 12 AD3d 715, 716 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered February 6, 2004, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After selling crack cocaine to an undercover informant on two separate occasions, defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following a jury trial, he was convicted of both charges and was sentenced as a second felony offender to consecutive terms of 71/2 to 15 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
His sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has an extensive criminal record dating back to his youth and the charges at issue appear to have arisen from defendant’s participation in a pattern of drug-related activity. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences (see People v Davis, 4 AD3d 567, 568 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 798 [2004]; People v Parker, 305 AD2d 871, 872 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 597 [2003]). We reach this conclusion notwithstanding the recent amendments to the Rockefeller Drug Laws, which defendant concedes were not in effect at the time he was sentenced.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered July 19, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a seven-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. We reject defendant’s contention that the sentence was based upon an unrelated assault charge. Defendant’s contention arises from the fact that the People rejected defendant’s request that he be placed in extensive rehabilitation instead of serving a prison term based in part upon defendant’s admission that he had been convicted of prior felonies and had recently been released on parole at the time of the instant offense. Furthermore, inasmuch as defendant was sentenced in accordance with the favorable plea agreement to the most lenient sentence permitted by statute (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] [b]), we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed (see People v Sczepankowski, 293 AD2d 212, 215-216 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 564 [2002]).

"Garry, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Tailleur, J.), rendered June 10, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of 10 years, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision, to be served concurrently with the sentence that defendant was already serving. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to County Court’s denial of his request for a Wade hearing is precluded by his unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v Barrier, 7 AD3d 885, 886 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 670 [2004]). His claim that his plea was not voluntarily entered because it was coerced survives his appeal waiver, but is unpreserved for our review, as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Lobaton, 140 AD3d 1534, 1535 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 972 [2016]; People v Conley, 135 AD3d 1238, 1238-1239 [2016]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable, as defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Forest, 141 AD3d 967, 968-969 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1145 [2017]).
Defendant also claims that he was denied due process on the ground that his plea was involuntary because he was not advised at the time of the plea that it would result in his driver’s license being suspended for six months. The record reflects that defendant was advised of the suspension of his driver’s license at the sentencing hearing, prior to the imposition of the sentence. Defendant was thus provided an opportunity to challenge the voluntariness of his plea in this regard, but failed to do so. Accordingly, this issue is also unpreserved for our review (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182-183 [2013]; People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Garraway, 144 AD3d 703, 703 [2016]; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2013]). In any event, the suspension of his driver’s license was a collateral consequence of defendant’s guilty plea and the failure to disclose this consequence during the plea colloquy does not warrant vacatur of the plea (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 184-185; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]; People v Garraway, 144 AD3d at 703; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d at 1250).
Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel survives his appeal waiver, insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacts the voluntariness of plea, but is also unpreserved for our review for lack of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1154-1155 [2017]; People v Macon, 142 AD3d 739, 739 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim involves matters outside of the record, it is more properly pursued in a motion pursuant to CPL article 440 (see People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]; People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 930 [2015]). Finally, defendant’s contention that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony drug offender because County Court violated CPL 400.21 (3) by failing to give him an opportunity to contest the allegations contained in the prior felony information is unpreserved for our review as he failed to object at sentencing (see People v Shelmandine, 128 AD3d 1180, 1180-1181 [2015]; People v House, 119 AD3d 1289, 1290 [2014]). In any event, the record reflects that County Court substantially complied with the statutory requirements (see People v Shelmandine, 128 AD3d at 1181; People v Walton, 101 AD3d at 1490).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered September 16, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony, in satisfaction of a 10-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to four years to life in prison. In addition, he waived his right to appeal the judgment of conviction as well as the sentence except to the extent a future legislative change in sentencing under the Rockefeller drug laws would entitle him to be resentenced. Defendant was sentenced as agreed and now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that his sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in light of recent legislation amending the Rockefeller drug laws. In view of defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal, he is precluded from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]), unless it is encompassed by the exception contained in defendant’s waiver. Chapter 643 of the Laws of 2005 is the only recent legislation amending the Rockefeller drug laws applicable to those, like defendant, who have been convicted of class A-II felonies. It provides that certain persons convicted of such crimes may apply for resentencing in accordance with Penal Law § 70.71 in the court that imposed the original sentence (L 2005, ch 643, § 1). However, persons sentenced for class A-II felonies prior to January 13, 2005 are not eligible for resentencing under the new law (see Senate Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2005, ch 643). Given that defendant was sentenced prior to this date on September 16, 2004, he is not entitled to resentencing under the new legislation. Accordingly, the exception contained in defendant’s waiver of appeal does not provide a basis for disturbing his sentence.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Going, J.), rendered April 29, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, then 16 years old, sold cocaine to an undercover police officer and was subsequently charged with four drug-related crimes. He pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 1 to 3 years in prison. Defendant appeals, contending that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to sentence him as a youthful offender and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive.
Initially, it was within County Court’s discretion to sentence defendant as a youthful offender and we do not find that the court abused its discretion in declining to do so (see, People v Chapman, 227 AD2d 665, lv denied 88 NY2d 934; People v Young, 224 AD2d 949; People v Diaz, 221 AD2d 749, lv denied 87 NY2d 921). County Court considered the negative recommendation of the Probation Department as well as the serious nature of the crime in making its determination. These were appropriate factors for the court to consider in denying youthful offender status to defendant (see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 334). In addition, we do not find that the sentence imposed is either harsh or excessive given the extent of defendant’s involvement in selling drugs and that defendant specifically agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain (see, People v Young, supra). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s judgment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Moynihan, Jr., J.), rendered September 6, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with conspiracy in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced in accordance with a negotiated plea to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of six years to life.
At issue here is the validity of defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal. In this regard, a review of the record reveals that defendant had not ingested any drugs or alcohol during the 24-hour period prior to his plea, he had discussed the case thoroughly with his attorney, including any potential defenses that he might have to the then-pending charges, and was advised in detail by County Court as to the rights that he was relinquishing by pleading guilty, including the waiver of his right to appeal. Defendant unequivocally acknowledged his understanding of the significance of these waivers. The record further reveals that defendant was fully familiar with the crim inal justice system having previously been thrice convicted of felonies. Under the circumstances, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911).
To the extent that defendant claims that his plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is clear that defendant received an extremely advantageous plea, and nothing in the record suggests that counsel’s conduct affected the plea-bargaining process or that the plea was the result of counsel’s poor performance (see, People v Ubrich, 245 AD2d 886, 887, lv denied 91 NY2d 945; see also, People v Perkins, 245 AD2d 956, 959-960, lv denied 91 NY2d 944).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered October 11, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a multicount indictment with various drug-related crimes arising from his sale of narcotics on four separate occasions in the City of Amsterdam, Montgomery County. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to 31/2 to 101/2 years in prison. On appeal, defendant argues, inter alia, that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
Initially, inasmuch as defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the sufficiency of his guilty plea on appeal (see, People v Comer, 236 AD2d 658; People v Miller, 234 AD2d 811; People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, lv denied 88 NY2d 994). Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of this claim, we would find it to be unavailing. The record discloses that County Court took painstaking efforts to explain to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the many rights he would be waiving as a result thereof. Although defendant had difficulty understanding the English language, County Court appointed a Spanish-speaking interpreter to assist defendant in understanding the proceedings and allowed defendant to confer with his attorney on a number of occasions to obtain further clarification. In answering the court’s questions during the plea allocution, defendant indicated that he knew what was transpiring and wished to plead guilty of his own free will. Therefore, we find no basis for vacating the guilty plea (see, People v Comer, supra, at 658; People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, lv denied 89 NY2d 927; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, lv denied 89 NY2d 919; see also, People v Carmona, 111 AD2d 930).
Likewise, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that defense counsel was ineffective. While defendant asserts that defense counsel should not have advised him to plead guilty but should have pursued the agency defense to the charges of sale of a controlled substance, we do not find that defense counsel’s strategy amounts to ineffective assistance given defendant’s admission to selling the drugs ""as a favor” for his employer and his potential exposure to a much lengthier prison sentence if convicted after trial. Based upon our review of the record, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Comer, supra, at 658; People v Bass, 236 AD2d 651; People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941).

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered July 16, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts).
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment stemming from the sale of cocaine on two occasions, defendant entered a guilty plea to two reduced counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement that included a waiver of appeal and of the right to seek post-conviction relief. He was sentenced, as agreed, to concurrent seven-year prison terms followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Upon review of the record, including the plea colloquy and written waiver of appeal, we find that there is an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent, as neither adequately conveyed “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]). Further, although the written waiver bears the same date as the plea proceeding, it was not mentioned during the plea or sentencing proceedings, it was not executed by his counsel, and there was no “attempt by the court to ascertain on the record an acknowledgment from defendant that he had, in fact, signed the waiver or that, if he had, he was aware of its contents” (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 265; cf. People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]).
Addressing the merits, we are not persuaded by defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The plea agreement permitted him to plead guilty to two reduced counts of the four upon which he was indicted, and to obtain concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences of shorter duration than the maximum allowed upon the charges as reduced. The plea agreement did not include a promise by County Court to recommend the Willard Drug Treatment Program; the People opposed such treatment and, ultimately, following review of the presentence investigation, County Court determined that it would not be appropriate (see People v Tollman, 92 AD3d 1082, 1083 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1065 [2013]). As defendant received the promised sentence, and the record fails to establish the presence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of sentencing discretion, we decline to reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]).
Finally, it is apparent upon review that there is a clerical error in the uniform sentence and commitment form, as it indicates that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] [b]), rather than as a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [ii]), and it must be amended accordingly (see People v Vasavada, 93 AD3d 893, 894 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 978 [2012]; compare People v Whalen, 101 AD3d 1167, 1170 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered March 14, 2006, (1) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and of violating the terms of his probation, and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In 2002, defendant was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced to five years of probation. In 2005, he was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, as well as violating the terms of his probation. A plea agreement was proposed and reviewed with defendant by County Court under which defendant would (1) plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and to violating the terms of his probation in satisfaction of the indictment, the violation petition and two pending misdemeanor charges, (2) be sentenced as a second felony offender to two years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, on the criminal possession charge and one year in jail on the probation violation, to run concurrently, and (3) waive his right to appeal. During the plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant of the maximum sentences that could be imposed for the crime and violation at issue and that the agreed-upon sentences would be honored only if defendant were not arrested or charged with another crime prior to sentencing. Defendant’s guilty plea and admission to the violation petition were then accepted by County Court. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested and indicted for selling cocaine, which he admitted. Because defendant had violated the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him on the criminal possession charge to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and to a consecutive term of 1 to 3 years in prison on the probation violation. Defendant now appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment to represent defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record and counsel’s brief, we agree. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed and counsel’s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], Iv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered January 4, 1990, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant’s sentence of concurrent prison terms of 2Vz to 7 Vz years upon her conviction of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was part of the plea-bargain agreement made with defendant. The sentence was well within the statutory guidelines and another more serious charge was dropped as a result of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances, defendant’s admission that she is addicted to cocaine fails to demonstrate either extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion by County Court warranting a reduction of her sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered March 27, 2009, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In the course of an investigation into a fight wherein an individual was stabbed, defendant made a statement to police in which she admitted to possessing crack cocaine with intent to sell and secreting it in her anal cavity after the fight occurred. Although the plastic bag storing the crack cocaine was retrieved from defendant’s person, the crack cocaine was not. Following an unsuccessful attempt to suppress her statement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a pending indictment and waived her right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon prison term of seven years and postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant argues that defense counsel was ineffective at the Huntley hearing by failing to sufficiently explore the possibility that she was impaired by crack cocaine use at the time she made her statement. Assuming that this argument calls into question the voluntariness of defendant’s guilty plea, her failure to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction leaves it unpreserved for our review (see People v Jenks, 69 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2010]; People v Cintron, 62 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 742 [2009]). Regardless, her argument fails on the merits. Defendant was examined at a hospital prior to making her statement, no other evidence in the record indicated that she was impaired, and defense counsel appropriately cross-examined the detective who obtained that statement regarding defendant’s mental state (see People v Hayden, 250 AD2d 937, 939 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 879 [1998]; People v Leary, 145 AD2d 732, 734 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 1017 [1989]). Moreover, defendant expressed her satisfaction with counsel during the plea colloquy and indicated that she had discussed potential defenses in the case with him (see People v Cintron, 62 AD3d at 1158).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered February 28, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced to a prison term of four years to life. On this appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty as he did in satisfaction of a three-count indictment which included the more serious charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. In addition, the sentence was less than the harshest possible. Given these facts, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

"Mercure, J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered January 28, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered February 14, 1994, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
By each of two separate indictments, defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, as the result of his alleged participation in sales of cocaine on March 2, 1992 and March 16, 1992, respectively. In accordance with a plea bargain, defendant disposed of both indictments with a plea of guilty to a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a predicate felony offender to a prison term of 9 to 18 years.
Thereafter, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction. The sole evidence in support of the motion was defendant’s own affidavit, in which he stated that he had no contact with his assigned counsel from the July 9, 1992 arraignment until counsel came to see him on November 21, 1992 to advise him of the impending trial of the indictments and of the People’s offer of a negotiated plea. Although he was innocent of the charges and had a valid defense, defendant continues, confronted with his counsel’s insistence and fearing that his counsel was not prepared for trial, defendant reluctantly accepted the proposed plea bargain. Finally, defendant states that, in order to induce County Court to accept his plea and thereby avoid trial, he falsely indicated at the plea proceeding that he was satisfied with the job his counsel had done, that nobody had pressured or coerced him into pleading guilty, that he did not wish to discuss the matter any further with anyone, and that he had been allowed sufficient time to reflect on the matter. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals the judgment of conviction and, by permission, the denial of his CPL article 440 motion.
We conclude that defendant’s self-serving and conclusory averments, which are unsupported by any other affidavit or evidence and which are directly contradicted, first, by the representations defendant made to County Court at the time of entry of his guilty plea and, second, by the record before us, evidencing counsel’s thorough pretrial motion practice and negotiations and the highly advantageous plea bargain brought about as a result, did not warrant a hearing on the CPL article 440 motion (see, CPL 440.30 [4] [b], [c], [d]; People v Shamblee, 222 AD2d 834, 835; People v Edison, 192 AD2d 789, lv denied 83 NY2d 966). Inasmuch as defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is the underpinning for the argument that he did not enter a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of his right to appeal, our determination that defendant was provided with meaningful representation consistent with his constitutional rights (see, People v Shamblee, supra; People v Frayer, 215 AD2d 862, 864, lv denied 86 NY2d 794) is dispositive of the direct appeal as well.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered March 6, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He waived his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement, and County Court deferred sentencing to permit his participation in the Albany County Drug Treatment Court program. County Court advised defendant, however, that his failure to successfully complete that program could result in a maximum sentence of four years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant thereafter violated the terms of the participation agreement on multiple occasions. Rather than undergo a hearing to determine if he had violated the terms of the agreement, defendant admitted to the violations in exchange for a prison sentence of three years and postrelease supervision of two years. County Court imposed that sentence, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s argument that he was deprived of a hearing to determine whether he violated the participation agreement is not properly before us, as he failed to request a hearing or move to withdraw his plea on that basis and, indeed, was aware of his right to a hearing but elected to forgo it and admit to the violations in exchange for a prison sentence below the potential maximum (see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715-716 [2004]; People v Forkey, 72 AD3d 1209, 1210-1211 [2010]; People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1125-1126 [2010]). His remaining contention, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Saucier, 69 AD3d at 1126; People v Conway, 45 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 763 [2008]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree in full satisfaction of two indictments and various other pending charges. He was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to prison terms of 4 to 12 years on the controlled substance charge, three years on one of the weapons charges and 1 to 3 years on the other weapons charges, all to run concurrently.
Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Our review of the record and defendant’s pro se brief, however, reveals the existence of issues that are “ ‘arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous)’ ” (People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001], quoting Anders v California, 386 US 738, 744 [1967]), including whether County Court erred in denying defendant’s suppression motion. Accordingly, and without expressing any opinion as to the merits of the issues raised, counsel’s application is granted. New counsel must be assigned, however, to address any issues that the record may disclose (see People v Shaw, 301 AD2d 751, 751 [2003]; People v Van Sickle, 293 AD2d 880, 881 [2002]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered August 13, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, was sentenced to the agreed-upon term of two years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision and waived his right to appeal. Defendant now appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was illegal.
Preliminarily, defendant’s valid waiver of his right to appeal does not foreclose his present challenge to the legality of his sentence (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Turning to the merits, although not entirely clear from the record, it appears that defendant had at least two prior felony convictions at the time of sentencing— one for assault in the second degree and one for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant admitted both prior felony convictions, but the CPL 400.21 statement filed by the People referenced only the conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As defendant correctly notes, it is not clear from the sentencing minutes which of the two prior felony convictions County Court utilized as the predicate felony in imposing sentence. The record does, however, reflect that County Court stated that it sentenced defendant as a second felony offender pursuant to Penal Law § 70.06.
Penal Law § 70.06 does not provide for the imposition of a determinate sentence; any sentence imposed thereunder must be an indeterminate sentence (see Penal Law § 70.06 [2], [3], [4]), with a maximum term of no less than three years and no more than four years and a minimum of one half of the maximum term. Having been convicted of a felony defined in Penal Law article 220, defendant was required to be sentenced in accordance with Penal Law § 70.70, which mandates that the sentence for either a felony drug offender or a second felony drug offender be a determinate sentence. Had defendant been properly sentenced under this statute, he would have received— depending upon the predicate felony employed—a determinate sentence of either IV2 years as a felony drug offender (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [iv]) or two years as a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [iv]), followed by the appropriate period of postrelease supervision. Although defendant did admit to County Court that he was previously convicted of the drug felony described in the CPL 400.21 statement filed by the People, the court stated twice at sentencing that defendant was being sentenced to the minimum of two years of imprisonment because defendant had a prior violent felony conviction. Because of the lack of clarity in the sentencing record, the sentence is vacated and this matter is remitted to County Court for resentencing.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered December 8, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
The January 2004 execution of a search warrant by police at a residence in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County, yielded a quantity of narcotics and resulted in the arrest and subsequent indictment of defendant, among others. After County Court denied defendant’s suppression motion, he pleaded guilty to the sale and possession counts in the indictment. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to concurrent terms of 7 to 14 years in prison, prompting this appeal.
Initially, we note that defendant expressly waived his right to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion (see People v Booth, 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005]). Such waiver came in exchange for a sentencing promise by County Court (compare People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]), and otherwise appears to have been knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made (see generally People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-11 [1989]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as defendant failed to allege facts from which the court could conclude that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises subject to the warrant, we cannot conclude that County Court erred in denying his motion to suppress (see CPL 710.60; People v Wesley, 73 NY2d 351, 358-359 [1989]; People v Prodromidis, 276 AD2d 912, 912 [2000]; see also People v Geraghty, 212 AD2d 358 [1995], lv denied 85 NY2d 938 [1995]).
As to defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence, we likewise note that such claim was encompassed within his knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of appeal (see People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 826 [1998]). Moreover, although this Court “may be divested of its unique interest-of-justice jurisdiction only by constitutional amendment” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; see People v Seaberg, supra at 9; People v Thompson, 60 NY2d 513, 520 [1983]), defendant, as a result of his valid appeal waiver, has relinquished his right to request that we exercise such authority (see People v Lopez, supra at 255).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Warren County (Austin, J.), entered July 30, 2003, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, after a hearing.
Defendant, a citizen of Jamaica, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to six months in jail. Defendant thereafter moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion, after a hearing, and defendant now appeals with permission from this Court.
Defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal precludes him from asserting ineffective assistance of counsel except to the extent that it may have impacted the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Smith, 301 AD2d 671, 673 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 658 [2003]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 633 [2003]; People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, 800 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 717 [1993]). In this regard, defendant claims that counsel failed to advise him that his guilty plea could result in his deportation to Jamaica. Although counsel’s affirmative misrepresentations regarding deportation or other consequences of a plea may constitute ineffective assistance under certain circumstances, it is well established that counsel’s failure to apprise a defendant of the possibility of deportation— “an act of omission”—does not by itself establish ineffective assistance (People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 18 [2002], affd 1 NY3d 109 [2003]; see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404-405 [1995]).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Greene County (Battisti, Jr., J.), entered September 7, 1994, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, without a hearing.
Defendant was indicted for the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. On September 28, 1993, pursuant to a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal the conviction and sentence. Subsequently, he was sentenced to the agreed term of imprisonment of six years to life.
Defendant thereafter moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, which motion was denied by County Court. Defendant appeals from said denial and, although the notice of appeal states that he is also appealing from the conviction itself, his appellate brief is limited to the denial of the CPL 440.10 motion. Defendant’s sole contention on this appeal is that pursuant to People v Ryan (82 NY2d 497), his plea should be vacated on the grounds that the prosecution was not able to demonstrate his actual knowledge of the quantity of the controlled substance and that the Ryan holding should be applied retroactively.
Although the Court of Appeals has since determined that the Ryan decision (supra) would be retroactive to cases pending on direct appeal at the time of the Ryan decision on December 16, 1993, the Court further held that the issue of proof of defendant’s knowledge as to both possession and weight of the controlled substance must be fully preserved for appellate review (see, People v Hill, 85 NY2d 256). In People v Gray (86 NY2d 10), the Court of Appeals again emphasized that this issue must be fully preserved by a defendant (see, People v Harrell, 86 NY2d 806).
In the instant case there was no such preservation and the record discloses that at the time of the plea allocution defendant answered in the affirmative when asked by County Court if he knowingly and unlawfully possessed one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances of an aggregate weight of two ounces or more containing a narcotic drug. In addition, as part of the plea bargain defendant waived his right to appeal and has not moved to vacate the plea. Although a guilty plea does not preclude the right to raise certain jurisdictional or constitutional defects, it generally removes the issue of factual guilt from the case where the claim relates to the factual elements of the crime charged (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1). In the instant case, as in People v Ryan (supra), where a question of statutory interpretation is involved, by pleading to a lesser crime defendant determined that he would not litigate the question of guilt and surrendered certain rights, including the right to challenge the factual basis for the plea, even in a postconviction motion (see, People v Hereida, 187 AD2d 272, Iv denied 81 NY2d 841; People v Hadden, 158 AD2d 856; People v Armer, 119 AD2d 930). Further, where the purported failure to require defendant to allocute all the elements of the crime appears on the record, the sufficiency of the plea allocution can be reviewed only by direct appeal and cannot be attacked in a CPL 440.10 proceeding and used as a substitute for direct appeal (see, People v Cooks, 67 NY2d 100).
Thus, this plea should not be subjected to collateral attack and we affirm the order of County Court denying defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered April 22, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, with no sentencing commitment by County Court. The court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an aggregate prison term of seven years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, asserting that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Although defendant expressed remorse for his crimes and took steps to address his substance abuse problem, given his criminal history and his exposure to a much more substantial prison term, we find that County Court appropriately considered relevant information and factors in imposing the sentence, and the record evinces no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v O’Brien, 122 AD3d 957, 958 [2014]; People v Mitchell, 41 AD3d 1045, 1045-1046 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 924 [2007]).

Ordered that the judgments are modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that all of the sentences shall run concurrently. As so modified, the judgments are affirmed.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, there was no requirement that the Trial Judge be disqualified from presiding over the trial (see, People v Tartaglia, 35 NY2d 918, 919; People ex rel. Stickle v Fay, 14 NY2d 683; People v Harris, 117 AD2d 881, 882), notwithstanding our earlier decision which reversed the conviction of the defendant’s accomplice (People v Smith, 120 AD2d 753). This is especially so since the defendant and Smith were tried separately, before juries (cf. People v Corelli, 41 AD2d 939; People v Vetrano, 42 AD2d 987), and while the Trial Judge, before assuming his judicial office, had, as an Assistant District Attorney, prosecuted Smith, he did not prosecute this defendant.
We do find, however, that the defendant’s sentences were excessive to the extent indicated, as it appears that he was impermissibly penalized for asserting his right to a trial (see, People v Patterson, 106 AD2d 520).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Ceresia, Jr., J.), rendered July 26, 1991, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Upon defendant’s demand, the People served a bill of particulars which alleged that the sale and possession crimes both occurred at one specific address in the City of Rensselaer, Rensselaer County. During his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that the possession crime charged in count two of the indictment occurred at a location in Rensselaer that was different from the address specified in the bill of particulars. Defendant moved to dismiss count two of the indictment and the People moved to amend the bill of particulars to allege that the crime charged in count two of the indictment occurred at both locations in Rensselaer. County Court denied defendant’s motion and granted the People’s motion.
At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of the crime charged in count one of the indictment and not guilty of the crime charged in count two. Defendant’s motion to set aside the verdict was denied and he was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years.
On this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in permitting the People to amend the bill of particulars in regard to the location of the crime charged in count two of the indictment. We reject defendant’s contention that the People changed the theory of the prosecution by altering the address in Rensselaer where the criminal possession of the controlled substance allegedly occurred (see, People v Parker [Clinton], 186 AD2d 157, lv denied 80 NY2d 1029). Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad faith, County Court properly permitted the amendment unless it resulted in undue prejudice to defendant (see, CPL 200.95 [8]; People v Parker [Clinton], supra). County Court offered the defense a continuance and defendant was ultimately acquitted of the crime charged in count two. Nevertheless, defendant maintains he was prejudiced because the amendment insulated count two from dismissal and, therefore, defendant elected not to testify to establish an agency defense as to the crime charged in count one because he did not want to testify about the events encompassed by count two. The argument is meritless.
Even if count two had been dismissed and defendant had elected to testify, he could have been questioned about his subsequent possession of drugs packaged similar to those sold as part of the crime charged in count one. Such evidence is relevant to defendant’s intent and is admissible to rebut the defense of agency (see, People v Phillips, 197 AD2d 793, lv denied 82 NY2d 929; People v Castaneda, 173 AD2d 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 963; see also, People v Ingram, 71 NY2d 474, 480-481). County Court properly permitted the amendment to the bill of particulars, which also establishes the propriety of County Court’s denial of defendant’s motions to dismiss count two of the indictment and to set aside the verdict.
Defendant’s remaining contention concerns the severity of the sentence, but the sentence was substantially less than the harshest possible, and we see no clear abuse of discretion or other extraordinary circumstances (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"— Appeal by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Richmond County (Felig, J.), both rendered May 3, 1989, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 269S/88 and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 124/89, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences.
Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that his pleas should be vacated because the court imposed sentences greater than that bargained for is unpreserved for appellate review (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636). In any event, the court expressly advised the defendant that a sentence of five to fifteen years would be imposed upon his conviction under Indictment No. 269S/88 if he failed to stay out of further legal ""trouble”. Prior to sentencing, the defendant was arrested twice for unrelated drug and weapon possession charges. Therefore, the court was not bound by its original sentencing promise and was not required to permit the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea prior to imposing the enhanced sentence (see, People v Caridi, 148 AD2d 625; see also, People v McNeill, 164 AD2d 951; People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered January 21, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered February 28, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and conspiracy in the second degree.
After a mobile methamphetamine laboratory was discovered in the bathroom of defendant’s motel room, he was arrested and charged by indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (count 1), unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree (count 2) and conspiracy in the second degree (count 3). Defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that count 3 was jurisdictionally defective was denied and, thereafter, the People moved to amend that count of the indictment (see CPL 200.70). County Court granted the People’s motion, finding that the requested amendment did not change the People’s theory as presented to the grand jury. Subsequently, defendant entered a plea of guilty to all counts of the indictment and was later sentenced, as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction, to an aggregate prison term of 15 to 20 years to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision. He was also ordered to pay restitution. Defendant now appeals.
We find merit to defendant’s argument that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective, a claim which is not foreclosed by his guilty plea (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]; People v Motley, 69 NY2d 870, 871-872 [1987]; People v Griswold, 95 AD3d 1454, 1454 [2012], lv denied 97 NY3d 997 [2012]). It is well settled that “ ‘[a] valid and sufficient accusatory instrument is a nonwaivable jurisdictional prerequisite to a criminal prosecution’ ” (People v Dreyden, 15 NY3d 100, 103 [2010], quoting People v Case, 42 NY2d 98, 99 [1977] [citation omitted]; accord People v Jackson, 18 NY3d 738, 741 [2012]). An indictment is jurisdictionally defective “ ‘if it does not charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime, by, for example, failing to allege every material element of the crime charged, or alleging acts that do not equal a crime at all’ ” (People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013], quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d at 231; see People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978]; People v Polanco, 2 AD3d 1154, 1154 [2003]).
Here, count 3 of the indictment charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree, a crime which requires an “intent that conduct constituting a class A felony be performed” (Penal Law § 105.15). While count 3 references the relevant statutory section for conspiracy in the second degree and expressly states that defendant acted “with intent that conduct constituting a class A felony be performed,” it does not include any statutory reference to the class A felony listed in count 1 of the indictment. Rather, the factual allegations—that “defendant did agree with [another] to unlawfully manufacture, prepare or produce methamphetamine”—are taken from count 2 of the indictment, which charged the class D felony of unlawful manufacturing of methamphetamine in the third degree (see Penal Law § 220.73). The unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, even in the first degree, does not constitute a class A felony (see Penal Law § 220.75), and third-degree unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, as charged in count 2 of the indictment, could only be grounds for a charge of conspiracy in the fifth degree, a class A misdemeanor (see Penal Law §§ 105.05, 220.73).
While it is true that “[t]he incorporation [in an indictment] by specific reference to the statute [defining the crime charged] operates without more to constitute allegations of all the elements of the crime required by explicit provision of the statute itself or by judicial gloss overlaid thereon” (People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586 [1981]; see People v D’Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 735 [2002]; People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850 [1988]), such reference may be negated, as it was here, by the inclusion of conduct that does not constitute the crime charged (see People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d 1126, 1128 n 3 [2009]; compare People v Motley, 69 NY2d at 872). Accordingly, count 3 of the indictment was jurisdictionally defective because it failed to effectively charge defendant with the commission of a crime. Count 3 must be dismissed, therefore, and defendant’s sentence on that count must be vacated (see People v Hines, 84 AD3d 1591, 1591-1592 [2011]; People v Reeves, 78 AD3d 1332, 1333 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 835 [2011]; People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d at 1127-1128).
While not essential to our holding, it bears noting that the People’s efforts to cure the jurisdictional defect in count 3 of the indictment were not authorized by the terms of GPL 200.70. Pursuant to GPL 200.70 (1), a trial court may permit an indictment to be amended “with respect to defects, errors or variances from the proof relating to matters of form, time, place, names of persons and the like,” so long as the amendment does not change the theory of the prosecution as presented to the grand jury or otherwise tend to prejudice a defendant on the merits. Significantly, however, GPL 200.70 (2) prohibits any amendment of the indictment when, among other things, the amendment is needed in order to cure a failure to charge or state an offense (see GPL 200.70 [2] [a]). In short, “notwithstanding the fact that the [g]rand [j]ury minutes support a charge, the indictment cannot be amended to cure one of the defects specified in [GPL 200.70 (2)]” (Peter Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, GPL 200.70 at 18; see e.g. People v Struts, 281 AD2d 655, 656 [2001]). Here, the amendment effectively cured the failure to charge the crime of conspiracy in the second degree and, therefore, was prohibited by GPL 200.70 (2), regardless of any consistency with the People’s theory before the grand jury (see People v Perez, 83 NY2d 269, 276 [1994]).
Defendant also contends, and the People concede, that the sentence imposed on count 2 of the indictment is illegal. The maximum permissible term of postrelease supervision for unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree is two years (see Penal Law §§ 70.70 [4] [b]; 70.45 [2] [c]; 220.73 [1]). Thus, County Court’s imposition of a three-year term of post-release supervision is not an authorized sentence pursuant to Penal Law § 70.45, and the judgment must be modified accordingly and the matter remitted for resentencing on that count (see People v Mao-Sheng Lin, 84 AD3d 1595, 1595 [2011]; People v Guay, 72 AD3d 1201, 1205 [2010], affd 18 NY3d 16 [2011]). We are not persuaded, however, that defendant was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender. Although he now contends that the sentences imposed on his predicate felony convictions were illegal, “a sentencing defect does not invalidate a prior conviction for purposes of adjudicating defendant’s subsequent felony offender status” (People v Ashley, 71 AD3d 1286, 1287 [2010], affd 16 NY3d 725 [2011]; see People ex rel. Emanuel v McMann, 7 NY2d 342, 344-345 [I960]; People v Mingo, 85 AD3d 1061, 1061 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 954 [2011]).
Our review of defendant’s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive is limited to the terms of the sentence that are not affected by our conclusion that count 3 of the indictment must be dismissed and the term of postrelease supervision imposed on count 2 must be vacated. In light of defendant’s significant criminal history and the dangerous nature of his activities, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting reduction of the sentence (see People v Kendall, 91 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2012]; People v Sawinski, 294 AD2d 667, 669 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 701 [2002]). We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be unavailing.

"— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Rohl, J.), rendered October 28, 1986, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant was indicted for criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, class A-I felonies. The charges arose out of a sale of nearly nine ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer on July 23, 1986. The defendant was permitted to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class AII felony. He was promised a term of incarceration of five years to life. The promised sentence was imposed.
The defendant raised two constitutional challenges to the sentence statute which mandates a maximum sentence of life incarceration for persons convicted of class A felony drug offenses. We find that the challenges to the statute are merit-less. The mandatory maximum of life imprisonment for this crime does ""not rise to the gross disproportionality violative of constitutional limitations” (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 111, cert denied 423 US 950; People v Donovan, 59 NY2d 834). Thus, the defendant’s claim that the sentencing statute violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment must fail.
Similarly, the defendant’s claim that the mandatory maximum sentence constitutes an illegal deprivation of judicial discretion is contrary to established authority. It is well settled that, within the constraints of due process, the Legislature has broad power to prescribe minimum and maximum sentences (see, People v Felix, 58 NY2d 156, 164, appeal dismissed 464 US 802). The statute at issue in this case mandates a maximum sentence of life while permitting a minimum sentence of 3 to 8 Vs years (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a], [3] [a] [ii]). These limitations on judicial discretion in sentencing do not violate due process (see, People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93, 96; People v Butler, 46 AD2d 422, 426-427).
Furthermore, the statute does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as applied to the defendant; although the defendant had no prior criminal record, the amount of cocaine sold in this case was substantial. Moreover, the defendant was actively involved in the transaction and was motivated by greed. The defendant has not shown that his sentence was disproportionate to the sentences imposed upon other similarly situated defendants. Under the circumstances, the sentence was not disproportionate to the crime (see, Castillo v Harris, 491 F Supp 33 [SD NY 1980], affd 646 F2d 559; People v Murphy, 53 AD2d 937).
Finally, the facts of this case do not warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice. The defendant, who pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive the sentence which was actually imposed, has no basis to now complain that his sentence was excessive (see, People v Ramos, 109 AD2d 898, 899; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816, 817).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Reilly, Jr., J.), rendered December 13, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We reject defendant’s claim that his negotiated sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison is unduly harsh or excessive.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), rendered January 24, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to an agreement by which he would be granted youthful offender treatment and sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. Defendant was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing and the promised disposition was made contingent upon his reporting back to court for sentencing; if defendant was arrested prior to sentencing on a Penal Law violation, the agreed-to disposition would be nullified and he would be subject to a harsher sentence.
On the date of sentencing it appeared that defendant had been arrested and indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. Defense counsel responded that defendant pleaded not guilty to that charge, that he maintained his innocence, that his arrest was completely out of his control and that he had not done anything. County Court disregarded those statements and, based upon the subsequent arrest, denied defendant youthful offender treatment and sentenced him to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.
The sentence must be vacated. When defendant disputed the validity of the subsequent arrest and criminal charge, County Court should have afforded him the opportunity to refute the subsequent charge at a presentence conference (see, People v Banks, 161 AD2d 957, 957-958).

"Weiss, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered April 5, 1984, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
On January 10, 1979, defendant was sentenced to five years’ probation on a conviction for burglary in the third degree. On December 17, 1983, approximately three weeks prior to the expiration of the probation term, defendant was placed under arrest on the basis of marihuana possession and two incidents in November 1983 in which he allegedly sold a controlled substance (codeine pills) to an undercover police informant. In February 1984, defendant entered a plea of guilty in Kingston City Court to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree in full satisfaction of the pending charges and received a 90-day suspended sentence. In the meantime, a petition for violation of probation was filed premised on the above incidents. On March 5, 1984, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the probation violation and, one month later, was sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment of nine months, in accord with the negotiated plea agreement.
On this appeal, defendant maintains that the sentence was unduly harsh and that he failed to receive the effective assistance of counsel. This latter contention is premised on the assertion that defendant’s attorney in the Kingston City Court matter failed to apprise him of the consequences of his guilty plea on the pending probation sentence. Beyond the fact that this argument is grounded on matters dehors the record, it simply represents a collateral challenge to a separate conviction, not the matter before us. With respect to the sentence, the record indicates that defendant served eight months’ imprisonment prior to being released on his own recognizance pending this appeal. In the meantime, defendant represents that he has married, fathered a child and obtained full-time employment. In effect, defendant requests this court to modify the sentence to time served, i.e., eight months.
There is little question that defendant received the benefit of his plea bargain when a nine-month sentence was imposed. Defendant has several previous criminal convictions, and his performance while on probation was less than remarkable. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the sentencing court (see, People v Howland, 108 AD2d 1019, 1020). At this juncture, however, we perceive little purpose in directing the completion of this sentence. Accordingly, we choose to exercise our discretion by modifying the sentence to a period commensurate with the time served (see, CPL 470.15; People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 335, affd 67 NY2d 625; People v Whiting, 89 AD2d 694).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered November 13, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree.
Defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree in satisfaction of a superior court information. County Court made no commitment as to sentencing although defense counsel and the prosecutor jointly recommended that defendant receive a sentence of restitution, six months in jail and five years probation. Upon reviewing the presentence report, County Court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence of 1 to 4 years along with restitution and an order of protection in favor of the victim. Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive.
Inasmuch as defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, this issue has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Nevertheless, were we to reach it, we would find no evidence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the sentence imposed in the interest of justice given the underlying circumstances detailed in the record (see, People v Wright, 233 AD2d 618).

On this appeal defendant contends that the sentence of 2 to 6 years’ imprisonment imposed upon her conviction is harsh and excessive and that County Court abused its discretion in failing to waive the mandatory surcharge. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment and pleaded guilty knowing that she would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, which was substantially less than the harshest possible sentence. Given these facts, as well as defendant’s criminal record, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Revels, 191 AD2d 905; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, Iv denied 71 NY2d 899). We also find no abuse of discretion in the denial of defendant’s request to waive the mandatory surcharge (see, People v Fulton, 138 AD2d 514, Iv denied 71 NY2d 1027).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered August 21, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as agreed to two years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
The sole argument advanced by defendant is that his sentence was harsh and excessive to the extent that it included a three-year period of postrelease supervision. We disagree. Noting that defendant obtained a favorable plea resolution, we find neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the presence of any extraordinary circumstances justifying a modification of the bargained-for sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Gillespie, 19 AD3d 878 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered August 31, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a six-count indictment with various drug-related crimes. In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the first count, after it was amended and reduced, of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant agreed to waive her right to appeal and to be sentenced to 2 Vs to 7 years in prison. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence and recommended, at defendant’s request, that she be afforded entry into the ASAT and CASAT programs for substance abuse. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by her waiver of the right to appeal as well as her failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Wehrle, 308 AD2d 660, 661 [2003]). Inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements inconsistent with her guilt which negated an essential element of the crime, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Cabezas, 307 AD2d 594, 595 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]).

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County, rendered September 27, 1979, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term of from one year to life and, upon resentencing, to an indeterminate prison term of from one to three years. Judgment affirmed. The defendant was charged in 1976 with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class AII felony, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, then a class A-III felony. In order to bring himself within the potentially beneficial provisions of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law, as it then read, and thus avert imposition of the mandatory sentence of imprisonment upon conviction (see Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 3, par [a], former cl [iii]), the defendant offered to co-operate with drug enforcement authorities. The relevant portion of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law provided that upon recommendation of the District Attorney, and the approval of the sentencing Judge and the Administrative Judge of the district, a defendant convicted of an A-III felony could be sentenced to lifetime probation in lieu of mandatory imprisonment upon meeting enu merated conditions. The record here indicates that such recommendation is not made by the Suffolk County District Attorney unless the drug enforcement authorities write to him that the defendant has co-operated to the fullest extent. Defendant’s efforts at co-operation were directed toward the obtaining of such a letter. Although the defendant’s co-operation led to two class A-l felony drug arrests and prosecutions, the drug enforcement officials refused to submit a letter to the effect that his efforts warranted probation treatment. The reason given for the refusal was the officers’ belief that the defendant had not aided their operation to the best of his ability. The letter that was sent to the District Attorney outlined the extent of cooperation for consideration as to whether the defendant should be permitted to plead guilty to a lesser offense. When he learned that the desired letter would not be forthcoming, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment in the interest of justice pursuant to CPL 210.40, alleging (1) that the drug enforcement officers had promised to send a letter recommending probation to the District Attorney if his co-operation produced two drug ""busts”; and (2) that the District Attorney had promised to recommend lifetime probation at sentencing if the defendant’s co-operation materially assisted in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of another drug felon. At the ensuing hearing, the defendant, drug enforcement officers who workéd with him, members of the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office, defendant’s present and former counsel, and a private investigator hired by defense counsel, all testified relative to the issue of the alleged promises of the officers and the District Attorney. The County Court denied the motion, finding that the defendant failed to prove that the District Attorney’s office had made any binding promise to recommend probation to the sentencing court. More specifically, the court found that drug enforcement authorities had stated that they would consider his role in the arrests in evaluating the extent of his co-operation, and that the District Attorney’s office agreed merely to consider a request for lifetime probation upon receipt of a sufficient letter from the undercover police officers. Although the defendant since has pleaded guilty to a class A-III felony and has been resentenced to the minimum imprisonment of one to three years (see Penal Law, § 60.09, subd b, par [i]), after an original imposition of a mandatory one year to life sentence (see Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 2, par [a]; subd 3, par [a], former cl [iii]), his claim that a promise of leniency had been made to him survives the plea for appellate purposes (see People v Argentine, 67 AD2d 180, after remand 71 AD2d 869; see, also, People v Greco, 69 AD2d 822). Nevertheless, in the absence of a promise broken which might bring the case within the purview of the rule that ""Justice does not allow one agent [of the State] to ignore promises made by the other, whatever the breadth of discretion involved” (Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57, 64), the judgment of conviction cannot be set aside. Dismissal in the interest of justice seems an inappropriate remedy for abuse which may flow from the breadth of discretion vested in the District Attorney by section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law (see. People v Eason, 40 NY2d 297, 302, concurring opn of Wachtler, J.), unless there is prosecutorial misconduct of the serious degree envisioned by the recent amendment to the Clayton statute (see CPL 210.40, subd 1, par [e], L 1979, ch 216, eff Jan. 1, 1980; see, also, People v Kaufman, 77 AD2d 924). The remedy for breach of a promise of recommendation may be enforcement of the promise (see, e.g., Santobello v New York, 404 US 257, on remand 39 AD2d 654; People v Young, 71 AD2d 582; People v Taylor, 64 AD2d 998; People v McFarland, 46 AD2d 616; cf. People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert den 419 US 1122) but even enforcement may not produce the desired sentence of probation (see Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., supra, pp 66-67). Such a recommendation under section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law is a matter within what Judge Wachtler has described as the ""unbridled” discretion of the District Attorney (see People v Eason, supra, p 302; People v Kaufman, supra), and is further subject to approval by both the sentencing Judge and the Administrative Judge of the district. Thus, despite the instant sentencing Judge’s declaration that he would have imposed probation had the District Attorney’s recommendation been forthcoming, he lacked the power to compel the making of such a recommendation and could not have preempted a contrary exercise of discretion by the Administrative Judge (cf. People v Nudelman, 70 AD2d 13, after remand 71 AD2d 1030). Defendant’s allegations concerning the constitutional infirmity of section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law already have been passed upon and rejected by the Court of Appeals (see People v Eason, supra). We recognize, nonetheless, that the degree of discretion vested in District Attorneys by the statute may result in abuse and we suggest that the Legislature consider the problem. Accordingly, affirmance is required. Lazer, J. P., Rabin and O’Connor, JJ., concur; Gulotta, J., concurs in the result.",,1111,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Kavanagh, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered May 29, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (six counts) and money laundering in the fourth degree.
As the result of an investigation into organized drug activity in Sullivan County, defendant — along with 11 others — was charged by indictment with conspiracy in the second degree (10 counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (nine counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (eight counts) and money laundering in the fourth degree. Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (six counts) and money laundering in the fourth degree. In return, he was promised that if he cooperated with the People and testified against his codefendants, the prison sentence to be imposed would not exceed 12 years. However, the terms of the plea agreement provided that, if defendant failed to fully cooperate and, in particular, refused to testify against any codefendant, he could receive up to 24 years on his conviction for one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count two), as well as an aggregate prison term of 12 years for his remaining convictions. Subsequently, defendant indicated that he would not testify at any trial of his codefendants and, prior to sentencing, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to a 24-year prison term on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count two), and directed that it run consecutively to the aggregate 12-year prison term it imposed for defendant’s remaining convictions, plus five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant claims that his plea was involuntarily entered because he was coerced into entering a guilty plea and, in particular, was never advised by County Court that his sentence would include a term of postrelease supervision. Initially, we note that while defendant executed a valid waiver of his right to appeal, he may still challenge the integrity of his guilty plea on the ground that it was involuntarily entered (see People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010]; People v Turner, 27 AD3d 962, 962 [2006]).
As for his plea, even though County Court conducted the plea allocution in two separate court appearances with defendant over a four-day period, it never advised defendant that a term of postrelease supervision would be part of his sentence. Instead, the court chose to rely on a letter by the District Attorney sent to defendant’s counsel to outline the parameters of the sentence to be imposed pursuant to this plea agreement. Notably, nowhere in this letter is there any indication that postrelease supervision would be part of defendant’s sentence. And, while the District Attorney made brief reference to postrelease supervision during the plea proceedings and defendant may, at some level, have been aware at the time he entered his plea that he would be placed on postrelease supervision at the end of his prison sentence, County Court remained obligated, prior to accepting his guilty plea, to conduct a plea allocution during which defendant agreed and understood that postrelease supervision would be part of the proposed sentence (see People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]; People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; People v Raymond, 81 AD3d 1076, 1076 [2011]; People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010]).
Further, while a court need not follow any particular litany when taking a guilty plea, it should conduct a plea allocution that, at the very minimum, identifies the fundamental rights that a defendant is forfeiting by entering such a plea and detail the essential terms of the sentence to be imposed pursuant to any plea agreement (see generally People v Green, 82 AD3d 1453 [2011]; People v Taylor, 82 AD3d 1291, 1292 [2011]; People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011]; People v Rush, 79 AD3d 1522, 1522-1523 [2010]; People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Strickland, 77 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2010]). Here, County Court limited its description of the proposed sentence to a blanket reference to the District Attorney’s letter and a statement that if defendant failed to abide by the obligations he assumed under the agreement, the court would “be free to sentence [him] to any sentence up to 24 years in prison.” The court never indicated during the plea allocution that the prison sentences to be imposed in such a circumstance could be served consecutively, or that it retained the right, if defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement, to impose a prison sentence not to exceed 36 years. As a result, defendant’s judgment of conviction must be reversed.
Peters, J.P, Spain, Stein and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, plea vacated, and matter remitted to the County Court of Sullivan County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court’s decision.
We note that we have previously had to vacate pleas and reverse underlying convictions in other cases where County Court similarly accepted guilty pleas without being assured, as a result of the plea allocutions, that defendants were fully aware of and agreed to the proposed sentences (see People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d at 1232).",,941,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Corso, J.), rendered November 12, 1996, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Suffolk County, for further proceedings consistent herewith.
In exchange for his plea, the defendant was promised that he would be placed in a Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (hereinafter TASC) drug treatment program. The defendant was advised that if he successfully completed the program, the current charges against him would be dismissed. Additionally, the defendant was warned that if he failed to complete the TASC program he would be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of three to six years. When the defendant appeared for sentencing, however, it was revealed that the TASC program to which he was sent would not permit him to take Prozac for his pre-existing psychiatric condition, and as a result, he was terminated from the program without completing it. The defendant thereupon asked that he be allowed to withdraw his plea on the ground that the drug treatment program was not suitable for him. The County Court rejected the defendant’s application, and proceeded to sentence the defendant to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of three to six years.
While the decision to allow a defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty generally rests in the sound discretion of the trial court (see, CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Brown, 251 AD2d 677), it is well settled that a plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert denied 419 US 1122). Under the circumstances herein, the defendant did not truly receive the benefit of his plea agreement. Thus, the County Court should have allowed the defendant to withdraw his plea. Mangano, P.

"Spain, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered April 7, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts).
Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of four years to life. He now appeals challenging the sufficiency of his plea allocution and, alternatively, asserting that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea under CPL 220.60 (3) or to vacate the judgment of conviction under CPL 440.10 (see, People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine (see, People v Lopez, supra, at 666) is not applicable here inasmuch as the record fails to disclose any circumstances that would have warranted further inquiry by County Court prior to accepting defendant’s plea (see, People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006; People v Vonderchek, 245 AD2d 979, 980, lv denied 91 NY2d 945). In any event, we find that defendant’s plea was entered into voluntarily and that his allocution established all of the necessary elements of the crimes to which he pleaded.
Likewise, we conclude that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive. Where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting modification (see, People v Brown, 239 AD2d 784, 785, lv denied 91 NY2d 870; People v Parson, 209 AD2d 882, 884, lv denied 84 NY2d 1014). In light of defendant’s prior criminal history and the serious nature of the crimes, we find no reason to modify the sentence imposed (see, People v Brown, supra, at 785; People v Vasquez, 231 AD2d 755, lv denied 89 NY2d 931).

In satisfaction of a six-count indictment charging him with various crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. On appeal, he asserts that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We find this argument to be unpersuasive. Defendant has not cited any compelling reasons for finding the sentence was inappropriate for the offense. In view of this, as well as the fact that the sentence was agreed to by defendant as part of the plea bargain and is the most lenient permissible under the statute, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s judgment.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Camacho, J., at plea; Kron, J., at sentence), rendered March 31, 2014, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
On December 3, 2012, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and other crimes. The plea was entered in exchange for a promise that, upon completion of a Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities (hereinafter TASC) program, the defendant would be sentenced to “no jail [time].” Otherwise, he would be incarcerated for one year followed by one year of postrelease supervision.
The defendant absconded and did not complete the TASC program. After he was returned to the Supreme Court, the defendant moved, in effect, to modify the terms of his 2012 plea agreement so as to condition his avoidance of imprisonment on completion of a different program, a Mental Illness and Controlled-Substance Abuse (hereinafter MICA) program. The court denied the motion and imposed the promised sentence of one year imprisonment followed by one year of postrelease supervision.
Contrary to the People’s contention, the defendant’s purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid. Among other things, the Supreme Court’s brief oral colloquy suggested that the scope of the waiver applied only to issues concerning the legality or excessiveness of the sentence, but not the conviction itself (see People v Maracle, 19 NY3d 925 [2012]; see generally People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133 [2014]). Further, although the record reflects that the defendant executed a written appeal waiver form, the transcript of the plea proceeding shows that the court never ascertained on the record whether the defendant read the written waiver form, discussed it with counsel, or was even aware of its contents (see People v Iovino, 142 AD3d 561, 561-562 [2016]; People v Pacheco, 138 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2016]; People v Brown, 122 AD3d at 145). Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his. right to appeal (see People v Pacheco, 138 AD3d at 1036; see generally People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-267 [2011]).
Nevertheless, the defendant’s contentions on appeal are without merit. The defendant argues that a TASC program was unsuitable for him and that he was unable to complete the TASC program because of a medical condition. He further argues that, after he violated the conditional plea by absconding and getting arrested twice, the Supreme Court should have placed him in the appropriate program rather than sentence him to one year imprisonment as promised. Since he already served his one-year term of imprisonment, the defendant argues that the proper remedy on appeal is a reduction of his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or vacatur of his felony conviction, and a sentence of time served.
Other than conclusory assertions made by defense counsel, there is no evidence that the TASC program was inappropriate treatment for the defendant (cf. People v Feliciano, 14 AD3d 308, 310 [2005]) or that the defendant was unable to complete the TASC program because of a medical condition (cf. People v Jimenez, 307 AD2d 880, 881 [2003]). A psychologist’s report submitted by the defendant, which contained a conclusory assertion that the defendant “would quite likely benefit from MICA treatment,” was insufficient to establish that completion of a TASC program was a goal that was beyond the defendant’s capacity to achieve.
In any event, even if the record showed that the defendant stood a better chance of completing a MICA program, as opposed to a TASC program, such circumstance would not warrant the relief requested by the defendant on this appeal, that is, to reduce his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or to vacate his felony conviction and sentence him to time served (see CPL 470.55 [2]; 220.60 [3]; People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 379, 385 n [2015]; cf.

"White, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered July 31, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment that included a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. In exchange, he was sentenced to a prison term of 8V3 years to life. As part of the agreement, defendant entered his plea prior to filing pretrial motions. On this appeal, defendant contends that his inability to file pretrial motions deprived him of the right to seek judicial inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, a process which might have revealed that there was an insufficient quantity of drugs in his possession at the time of his arrest to substantiate the most serious charge in the indictment, i.e., that of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Had this proven to be the case, defendant argues, he would not have been induced to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
This contention lacks merit. A defendant who accepts a plea bargain surrenders the right to challenge the factual basis for the plea and, in addition, is precluded from thereafter challenging the merits of charges that were dismissed in the course of plea bargain negotiations (see, People v Morelli, 228 AD2d 818, lv denied 88 NY2d 990; see also, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97, 108).
We also reject the argument that defendant’s sentence of 8V3 years to life was harsh and excessive. The record discloses that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea and in exchange therefor three other charges against him were dismissed. Defendant’s guilt of the crime of which he was convicted is uncontested. We conclude that the sentence imposed by County Court cannot be characterized as an abuse of discretion, nor are there any extraordinary circumstances present that would lead us to disturb it (see, People v Thompson, 233 AD2d 615; People v Smith, 210 AD2d 533, lv denied 84 NY2d 1039).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered February 28, 1994, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
After traveling by bus from New York City to Broome County, defendant and a companion were stopped by police and found to be in possession of a large quantity of cocaine. As a condition of her plea of guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant waived her right to a suppression hearing. She was sentenced to five years to life in prison. On appeal, defendant argues that the sentence is harsh and excessive because she was merely a courier for the transportation of drugs and the District Attorney pressured her into waiving her right to a suppression hearing in exchange for not seeking a sentence of 15 years to life. Insofar as the record reveals that defendant entered a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea of guilty and waived her right to a suppression hearing as a condition of this plea, defendant may not seek appellate review of suppression issues (see, People v Collier, 226 AD2d 923; People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958, lv denied 87 NY2d 1025). In view of defendant’s prior drug-related activities, the quantity of drugs seized and the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Lea-man, J.), rendered April 30, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with five counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree as a result of his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer. Defendant pleaded guilty to all of the charges in satisfaction of the indictment, as well as any uncharged crimes, and without any promise being made as to the sentence to be imposed. He was thereafter sentenced to six terms of 1 to 4 years in prison, three to run concurrently and three to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate prison term of 3 to 12 years.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record and the presentence investigation report, we disagree. Although defendant does not have a criminal record, he made five separate sales of cocaine to an undercover police officer in less than a one-month period of time. Inasmuch as each sale was a distinct act, consecutive sentences could have been imposed for each sale thereby further increasing the length of the sentence (see People v Kendrick, 261 AD2d 646 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1021 [1999]). Notably, the sentence actually imposed was less than the maximum authorized (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). Defendant’s only excuse for his conduct was that he exercised poor judgment after becoming caught up in the use of cocaine himself. Neither this nor any other aspect of the case persuades us that there are extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]; People v Charron, 198 AD2d 722, 723 [1993], lv denied 83 NY2d 803 [1994]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered August 14, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, then 16 years old, was charged with 16 separate drug-related crimes, arising from eight separate sales of cocaine or heroin. He pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all charges and was promised a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years. The sentence, however, was conditioned upon defendant not committing any further crimes between the date of the plea and sentencing. Prior to sentencing, County Court was advised that defendant had assaulted two inmates in the Montgomery County Jail. Following defendant’s waiver of his right to a hearing on these charges, County Court sentenced him to serve 5 to 15 years. Defendant appeals.
Inasmuch as defendant has not made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the sufficiency of his guilty plea on appeal (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, 977, lv denied 88 NY2d 994). Were we to consider the merits of defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea, we would find on the record before us that defendant, who was effectively represented, entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea, which included a relinquishment of his appeal rights (see, People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769). The transcript of the plea allocution discloses that County Court provided defendant with a detailed explanation of the ramifications of pleading guilty and that he fully understood the court’s explanation. Defendant has thus waived his right to challenge the severity of the sentence or County Court’s refusal to adjudicate him a youthful offender (see, People v Gaines, 234 AD2d 712).
In any event, given defendant’s pervasive involvement in illegal drug trafficking and the fact that some of the drug sales providing the basis for the indictment took place while defendant was on probation, County Court cannot be charged with abusing its discretion in declining to adjudicate him a youthful offender. Nor is the sentence he received unduly harsh or excessive. Not unimportantly, defendant agreed to the enhanced séntence of 5 to 15 years, in satisfaction of the charges contained in the indictment as well as the assault charges. Moreover, that sentence is less than the harshest penalty permissible under the statute. In sum, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Nardi, supra; People v Vasquez, 231 AD2d 755).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Rockland County (Nelson, J.), rendered September 17, 2013, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and unlawful possession of marijuana, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to a determinate term of imprisonment of 15 years followed by a period of five years of post-release supervision on the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and a fine of $100 on the conviction of unlawful possession of marijuana.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the term of imprisonment imposed on the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree from a determinate term of imprisonment of 15 years to a determinate term of imprisonment of 10 years; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped by a State Trooper for a traffic violation. The defendant was removed from the vehicle and placed in the back of a State Police vehicle. Two State Troopers testified that they observed the defendant, while seated in the back of the State Police vehicle, attempting to conceal or dispose of a package containing white powder. That substance was subsequently determined to be cocaine. During a search of the defendant at a State Police station, a State Trooper recovered a small amount of marijuana from his clothing.
The County Court did not err in excusing a certain prospective juror, in effect, for cause on the ground that the juror’s statements indicated that she “ha[d] a state of mind that [was] likely to preclude [her] from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial” (CPL 270.20 [1] [b]; see People v Scott, 16 NY3d 589, 595 [2011]; People v Johnson, 94 NY2d 600, 614 [2000]). The challenge for cause to the subject juror was not untimely (see CPL 270.15 [4]; see also People v Harris, 57 NY2d 335, 350 [1982]).
The County Court improperly conducted an ex parte conference with the prosecutor as to whether the subject prospective juror should be excused. Nonetheless, the court subsequently disclosed to the defense the substance of that conference. Further, as the subject prospective juror was ultimately properly excused for cause, the action of the court in conducting the ex parte conference did not result in prejudice, and does not warrant reversal under the circumstances (see People v Christie, 241 AD2d 699, 701 [1997]; People v Williams, 162 AD2d 649 [1990]).
The County Court erred in finding that the defendant’s Batson application (see Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79 [1986]) was untimely. A Batson challenge is timely where it is made prior to the commencement of trial, as was done here (see People v Scott, 70 NY2d 420, 425 [1987]; People v Ramirez, 295 AD2d 542 [2002]; People v Campos, 290 AD2d 456, 457 [2002]). The defendant properly preserved for appellate review his contention as to the allegedly improper use of peremptory challenges by the People (see People v Ramos, 91 AD3d 674 [2012]; People v Davis, 253 AD2d 634, 635 [1998]). However, the defendant failed to meet his prima facie burden of setting forth facts supporting an inference of discrimination (see People v Hecker, 15 NY3d 625, 653 [2010]; People v Green, 141 AD3d 1036 [2016]; People v Fryar, 29 AD3d 919, 920-921 [2006]).
The County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion nor violate the defendant’s right of compulsory process in denying his motion to subpoena a certain witness pursuant to CPL 650.20 or to depose that witness pursuant to CPL 680.10 (see People v Bradford, 300 AD2d 685, 686 [2002]; People v Rosenthal, 207 AD2d 364 [1994]).
The defendant’s contention, raised in his pro se supplemental brief, that the County Court failed to comply with the procedure for handling jury notes set forth by the Court of Appeals in People v O’Rama (78 NY2d 270, 277-278 [1991]) is without merit. Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the court did not fail to meaningfully respond to the jury note in question (cf. People v Kisoon, 8 NY3d 129, 133, 135 [2007]).
However, the sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated herein.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered January 16, 1998 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant’s challenge to the legality of the enhanced sentence imposed upon him as a second felony offender is not encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Mann, 258 AD2d 738, 739, lv denied 93 NY2d 900). Neverthe less, having negotiated a favorable plea bargain and entered his guilty plea with the clear understanding that he would be sentenced to a specific indeterminate prison term as a second felony offender, defendant had sufficient notice and opportunity to controvert the allegations in the second felony offender statement (see, id., at 739). When asked at sentencing whether defendant wanted to controvert anything in the statement, defense counsel advised Supreme Court that he had reviewed the statement with defendant and that there was no objection. In these circumstances, defendant waived any objection to the constitutionality of the predicate felony conviction and its use as the basis for the enhanced sentence (see, People v Wade, 260 AD2d 798, 799, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006, cert denied 528 US 1028; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850).
In any event, there is no merit to defendant’s claim that a discrepancy between State and Federal law regarding the need for an overt act to support a conviction of conspiracy precludes the use of defendant’s Federal conspiracy conviction as a predicate felony in New York. In determining whether a foreign crime is equivalent to a New York felony for the purposes of enhanced sentencing, the inquiry focuses upon a comparison of the elements of the foreign statute with the elements of the analogous Penal Law felony (see, People v Gonzalez, 61 NY2d 586, 589). Inasmuch as the Penal Law § 105.20 requirement of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy “is an evidentiary requirement unrelated to the elements of the substantive crime” (People v Rossney, 178 AD2d 765, 767, lv denied 79 NY2d 1007), the alleged discrepancy upon which defendant relies is irrelevant to the predicate felony issue.

Following entry of the plea, defendant made a pro se motion for the appointment of substitute counsel and to withdraw his plea of guilty. In accordance with defendant’s request, County Court appointed the Public Defender to represent him and adjourned the matter for one week. On the adjourned date, after hearing argument on the motion, County Court denied defendant’s request to withdraw his plea. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain and this appeal followed.
There should be an affirmance. Initially, we reject the argument that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. Our review of the record discloses no factual support for the contention that defendant’s plea was not voluntary and knowing. At the time of the plea, County Court conducted a searching inquiry and confirmed defendant’s knowledge of the various rights that he was waiving in connection with his plea of guilty. Further, defendant acknowledged that the matter had been extensively discussed with his attorney and indicated that he was accepting the negotiated plea to avoid the possibility of a much greater sentence if he were found guilty after trial. Significantly, defendant was exposed to a possible sentence of 25 years to life (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]). Although defendant did exhibit some reluctance in entering his guilty plea, a fair reading of the plea allocution indicates no evidence of threats or coercion but, rather, defendant’s mere unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation. Defendant’s acknowledgment that over two ounces of cocaine had been knowingly secreted in his car provided a factual predicate for his plea, and he did not profess his innocence at the time of his application in County Court or on appeal to this court (see, People v Bray, 170 AD2d 722, 723; People v Cance, 155 AD2d 764, 764-765).
We also reject the contention that County Court should have granted the application, made only one month prior to trial, for substitute counsel. A change of counsel at that stage would have had the inevitable effect of delaying the trial, and our review of the record shows no basis for defendant’s dissatisfaction with his attorney (see, People v Arroyave, 49 NY2d 264, 271-272; People v Nicholls, 157 AD2d 1004, 1005; People v Berard, 112 AD2d 470, 471): To the contrary, defendant’s attorney sought and obtained discovery, moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the Grand Jury proceedings and on speedy trial grounds, and moved to suppress the evidence obtained as the result of a search of defendant’s automobile. We also note that, although defendant had previously filed a complaint regarding his attorney’s failure to attend certain scheduled proceedings, the attorney’s absence had been adequately explained to County Court and defendant expressed no dissatisfaction with his representation at the time of the plea.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Kreindler, J.), rendered September 25, 1996, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would be released from custody in order to cooperate with the police department in an ongoing investigation. The defendant was to remain free from any further criminal activity and return to court on the scheduled sentencing date. The plea agreement gave the People the discretion to permit the defendant to withdraw the plea and plead guilty to a lesser charge and receive a lesser sentence than the minimum 3 to 6 year sentence for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. If the defendant did not return to court when he was supposed to or if he committed any other crimes while he was out pending sentence, the People could recommend a sentence of lxh to 15 years imprisonment. Sentencing was adjourned for approximately six weeks, and when the defendant failed to appear on that date, a bench warrant was issued. The defendant was arrested a couple of weeks later. At sentencing, it was learned that the defendant had also been recently arrested for drug possession and was issued a desk appearance ticket. Also at sentencing, an Assistant District Attorney, after having conversations with certain police personnel and the District Attorney’s Homicide Bureau Chief, expressed his dissatisfaction with the defendant’s cooperation in the ongoing investigation.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on the issues of, inter alia, the Assistant District Attorney’s motivation in refusing to make the requested recommendation of leniency. In view of the defendant’s re-arrest prior to sentencing, his failure to return to the court on the scheduled date, and the contentions of the Assistant District Attorney regarding his lack of cooperation, the court had no reason to believe that the decision not to recommend a lesser term of imprisonment was improperly motivated (see, People v Anonymous, 219 AD2d 525; People v Jones, 184 AD2d 528).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 7, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that his negotiated sentence of eight years to life should be reduced to a more lenient sentence. An examination of the plea allocution minutes reveals that defendant, who received a substantial benefit by being allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge in a multicount indictment, entered his plea with full knowledge of what the range of sentencing would be. Under the circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Lea-man, J.), rendered February 4, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree and was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 to 7 years. Defendant appeals contending that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was under a psychiatrist’s care and taking tranquilizers and, at a minimum, an examination pursuant to CPL article 730 should have been conducted. He further contends that under these circumstances, he was also denied the effective assistance of counsel. Alternatively, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
We affirm. Initially, defendant’s failure to move either to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes our review of his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea or the effectiveness of the assistance provided by counsel (see, People v Coppaway, 281 AD2d 754; People v Beekman, 280 AD2d 784, Iv denied 96 NY2d 780; People v Millis, 266 AD2d 581, lv denied 94 NY2d 826). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that defendant entered into a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and was not denied the effective assistance of counsel (see, People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617). Although defendant stated during the plea allocution that he saw a psychiatrist once every two weeks for sleeping problems and that he was taking prescription sleeping pills, County Court adequately inquired to determine that the medication did not impair defendant’s ability to understand the proceedings (see, id.).
Finally, we do not find the sentence imposed — which is the maximum sentence authorized — to be harsh and excessive. County Court clearly and repeatedly indicated prior to accepting defendant’s plea that it would not be bound to the joint recommendation of 2 to 4 years’ imprisonment — the minimum permitted sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [2], [3]; People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852). Thus, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the sentence imposed (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver Jr., J.), rendered January 3, 2012, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant faced drug charges in an indictment and forgery charges in a superior court information, and several plea arrangements foundered upon her refusal to provide any informa tion regarding her true identity. She eventually agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all pending charges, waive her right to appeal and be sentenced to a prison term of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court refused to accept that agreement and pointed out that its terms were more favorable to defendant than prior plea offers, notwithstanding her continued refusal to admit her identity and concomitant questions regarding the accuracy of her criminal record. Defendant then pleaded guilty to the entire indictment — namely, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree — and the separate superior court information was dismissed upon consent (see CPL 220.60 [1]). County Court sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of eight years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, and she now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant first contends that County Court abused its discretion by refusing to approve the plea agreement reached between her and the People. Inasmuch as “this issue is neither jurisdictional nor of a constitutional dimension, [her] right to appellate review of this issue was forfeited by [her] subsequent plea of guilty” (People v Brooks-Singh, 47 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2008]; see Missouri v Frye, 566 US —, —, 132 S Ct 1399, 1410 [2012]; People v Van Dyne, 12 AD3d 120, 124 [2004]; cf. People v Smith, 272 AD2d 679, 682 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 938 [2000]).
Defendant next asserts that the sentence imposed by County Court was vindictive because she refused to answer questions regarding her identity and prior criminal history during the plea colloquy. However, while the sentence was greater than the one contemplated by the prior plea agreement, the record reflects that it stemmed from appropriate sentencing factors such as defendant’s lack of remorse and her known prior criminal history (see People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 411-412 [1980]; People v Seymore, 106 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1045 [2013]; People v Merck, 63 AD3d 1374, 1376 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 861 [2009]). After reviewing those factors ourselves, we are unpersuaded that the sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Abdallah, 50 AD3d 1312, 1313 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Siedlecki, J.), rendered May 25, 1984, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He made a motion to suppress. At the same time, he was under indictment for a drug-related charged in Chemung County. Before the motion to suppress was heard, defendant chose to plead guilty. At that time, a suppression hearing was being conducted in the Chemung County action. The parties stipulated on the record that, should defendant’s motion to suppress in Chemung County be granted, he would be allowed to withdraw his plea and proceed with his motion to suppress in Tioga County. The suppression motion in Chemung County was denied, but we have reversed such denial on appeal (People v Paluska, 109 AD2d 389. Defendant now appeals, seeking reversal and an opportunity to withdraw his plea. While the District Attorney may well be correct that defendant’s proper means of obtaining this relief is a motion to County Court to vacate the conviction (CPL 440.10) rather than an appeal, in the interest of judicial economy, we reverse the judgment of conviction and vacate defendant’s guilty plea.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered December 6, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered September 27, 2004, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
In February 2002, a six-count indictment was handed up by a Saratoga County grand jury charging defendant with various drug sale or possession counts. In October 2002, pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. The terms of the plea bargain included, inter alia, an agreement that a count of attempted grand larceny in the second degree then-pending in Albany County would be reduced to a misdemeanor at the time that he appeared on that count. In December 2002, defendant was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in accordance with the plea bargain. Defendant filed a notice of appeal from that judgment of conviction. Thereafter, in November 2003, the pending attempted grand larceny count was dismissed in Albany County, apparently on speedy trial grounds. Subsequently, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the prison sentence of 4 to 12 years and be resentenced to a term of 3 to 9 years. County Court denied that motion and defendant appeals from that order.
Initially, we find that County Court properly denied defendant’s CPL 440.20 motion. Contrary to defendant’s contention, he has not established that his sentence was “unauthorized, illegally imposed or otherwise invalid as a matter of law” (CPL 440.20 [1]). Specifically, defendant asserts that his original attorney did not notify him of an offer of 3 to 9 years, which he would have accepted. However, the record establishes that, throughout the negotiations, the only definite offer made by the People was a sentence of 4 to 12 years. While there is proof that the prosecutor indicated that he would consider a counteroffer by defendant of 3 to 9 years under certain circumstances, it is undisputed that such a counteroffer was neither made by defendant nor accepted by the People. In the absence of a valid agreement, “the People had no obligation to abide by the terms suggested during the negotiation process” (People v Wright, 233 AD2d 618, 618 [1996]). Thus, we are not confronted with a situation where County Court did not sentence defendant in accordance with an actual agreement (see e.g. People v Powers, 134 AD2d 736, 736 [1987]).
We are also unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the sentence should be set aside because the plea bargain contemplated the reduction of the attempted grand larceny charge in Albany County which, instead, was ultimately dismissed. Significantly, County Court specifically noted on the record that the plea and sentence agreement would stand regardless of whether defendant eventually pleaded to a misdemeanor on the Albany County charge or chose to plead not guilty and go to trial. Since taking the matter to trial clearly contemplates acquittal as a possible disposition of the charge, the dismissal of the Albany County charge is not relevant to the subject matter.
Additionally, we find unavailing defendant’s claim that County Court erred in denying his CPL 440.20 motion without a hearing. The transcripts do not substantiate defendant’s contentions and the only basis for his allegations is contained in his own affidavit (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]). Defendant’s original attorney denies failing to inform defendant of the plea negotiations. However, even if the proof at a hearing would have established that defendant was not apprised that the prosecutor would consider a counteroffer, such a circumstance would not render the sentence illegal or invalid as contemplated by CPL 440.20. Since the record sufficiently establishes that defendant’s claim of a mistake in sentencing had no reasonable possibility of being true, it was not an abuse of discretion for County Court to determine the matter without a hearing (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]).
Finally, we have reviewed defendant’s argument that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice and find it to be unpersuasive.

"IN from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Czajka, J.), rendered October 25, 2002, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant and her paramour were charged in a nine-count indictment with numerous drug-related crimes after the police recovered approximately seven ounces of cocaine and miscellaneous drug paraphernalia from the apartment that defendant shared with her infant daughter. Defendant later maintained that the drugs belonged to her and admitted that she was making and selling crack from her apartment. She testified at the trial of her paramour that he was not involved in her drug selling operation. Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. No sentencing promise was made as part of the plea, although County Court informed defendant that she could receive anywhere from three years to life in prison. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to five years to life in prison and she now appeals.
We affirm. Upon reviewing the record, we find that defendant has failed to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion that would warrant reducing the sentence in the interest of justice. Defendant possessed a significant quantity of drugs, operated a well-organized distribution network from her home and, in doing so, exposed her child to a potential danger. In view of this, we find no reason to disturb the sentence (see People v Rosa-Oyola, 301 AD2d 750 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 658 [2003]; People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (King, J.), rendered November 8, 1989, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), and bail jumping in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of 8 to 24 years imprisonment for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, to run concurrently with three consecutive indeterminate terms of 8 to 24 years imprisonment for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), all to run consecutively to an indeterminate term of IV3 to 4 years imprisonment for bail jumping in the second degree.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).
Furthermore, the trial court properly denied the defendant’s request for substitution of counsel (see, People v Sawyer, 57 NY2d 12, cert denied 459 US 1178; People v Arroyave, 49 NY2d 264). The defendant’s request was made after the commencement of trial (People v Arroyave, supra, at 271-272), and he did not demonstrate sufficient good cause to warrant substitution (see, People v Sawyer, supra, at 19; People v Rodriguez, 126 AD2d 580).
Similarly, the sentence imposed upon the defendant was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). The imposition of consecutive sentences for each conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and for bail jumping in the second degree was appropriate under the circumstances of this case, as the offenses charged constituted separate and distinct acts (see, Penal Law § 70.25; People v Brathwaite, 63 NY2d 839). Moreover, there was no impropriety in the imposition of an aggregate maximum term of 76 years. Since the defendant was convicted of four crimes, at least one of which was a class B felony, pursuant to Penal Law § 70.30 (1) (c) (i), this aggregate maximum term must be deemed 30 years (see, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575; People v Bachman, 158 AD2d 930).

Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment. He was sentenced to the agreed-upon prison term of six years to life. Defendant contends on this appeal that the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive given that this is his first criminal conviction. Defendant’s lack of criminal history notwithstanding, we see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed herein (see People v Serna, 270 AD2d 646, lv denied 95 NY2d 804).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Dwyer, Jr., J.), rendered April 27, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and was sentenced to a prison term of 6 to 12 years as a predicate felon. He also pleaded guilty to two other unrelated felonies, assault in the second degree, a class D felony, and intimidating a witness in the third degree, a class E felony. On April 27, 1989, as part of the package plea bargain which included the sentence on the drug sale charge, defendant received concurrent sentences of 3 to 6 years on the assault charge and lVi to 3 years on the witness intimidation charge.
On this appeal, defendant has challenged the sentence for the criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction. Defendant contends that County Court failed to inquire if he wished to controvert the allegations as provided in CPL 400.21. At sentencing, the court and defendant were provided a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 charging that he had been previously convicted of attempted robbery in the first degree on March 26, 1985 within this State, which constituted a predicate felony. When asked if this was true, defendant readily admitted the same. Immediately thereafter, and on several subsequent instances, defendant and his counsel were both given the opportunity to say anything they wanted. No objection was registered by either defendant or his counsel. There was some discussion about withdrawal of the plea on the assault and intimidation charges, but defendant ultimately decided to plead guilty to these charges as well. On this record, there has been substantial compliance with the statute which provides that the sentencing court must inquire if the defendant controverts the prior felony (see, People v Santana, 104 AD2d 677, 678). In addition, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the compliance with CPL 400.21 has been substantial and that the challenge should be rejected (see, People v Kluck, 156 AD2d 830).
Finally, defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was presented with a criminal record which included two other serious crimes to which defendant had pleaded guilty and for which he was to receive concurrent sentences. The grounds urged for leniency or mitigation fail to demonstrate any positive or exceptional circumstances. Moreover, prior attempts at rehabilitation have been unavailing. Accordingly, there has been no showing of abuse of County Court’s discretion in sentencing (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

In 2012, following his unsuccessful motion to suppress a quantity of crack cocaine discovered on his person, defendant, in full satisfaction of two pending indictments, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was thereafter sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appealed and his assigned counsel filed an Anders brief and moved to be relieved as counsel.

Initially, we reject defendant’s challenge to the validity of his waiver of appeal, as we are satisfied upon our review of the plea colloquy and the written waivers of appeal that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Ramos, 135 AD3d 1234, 1235 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 935 [2016]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1349-1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]; People v Viele, 130 AD3d 1097, 1097 [2015]). The valid waiver of appeal precludes defendant’s challenge to County Court’s denial of his motion to suppress the crack cocaine found on his person (see People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1230 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015]; People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]; People v Colon, 101 AD3d 1161, 1161 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]).
Defendant further argues that count 2 of the indictment charging him with conspiracy in the fourth degree was jurisdictionally defective because it failed to allege all material elements of the crime, particularly the object crime that he and another person allegedly conspired to commit. While this argument survives both defendant’s guilty plea and his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-233 [2000]; People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Martinez, 79 AD3d 1378, 1379 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 798 [2011]), we find no merit to it. “An indictment is jurisdictionally defective only if it does not effectively charge the defendant with the commission of a particular crime—for instance, if it fails to allege that the defendant committed acts constituting every material element of the crime charged” (People v D’Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 734-735 [2002]; see People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]). As relevant here, “[a] person is guilty of conspiracy in the fourth degree when, with intent that conduct constituting ... a class B or class C felony be performed, he or she agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct” (Penal Law § 105.10 [1]).
Here, count 2 of the indictment charging conspiracy in the fourth degree incorporated by reference the applicable statutory provision, which reference “operates without more to constitute allegations of all the elements of the crime” (People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586 [1981]; see People v D'Angelo, 98 NY2d at 735; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d 979, 980 [2015]). Moreover, with respect to the object crime, count 2 of the indictment specifically set forth the same conduct alleged in count 1 of the indictment charging bribery in the second degree, a class C felony (see Penal Law § 200.03). Accordingly, as count 2 of the challenged indictment charged defendant with the commission of a particular crime and sufficiently apprised him of that crime (see People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850 [1988]; People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1115 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d at 980), it was not jurisdiction-ally defective.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered May 30, 1985, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was indicted with two codefendants in a two-count indictment charging them with criminal possession of Vs ounce or more of cocaine in violation of Penal Law § 220.09, a class C felony. In a negotiated plea, defendant was permitted to plead guilty to one count of the indictment. He was thereafter sentenced to 1 Vs to 4 years’ imprisonment. Defendant contends that the sentence is excessive and an abuse of discretion because County Court imposed a harsher sentence on defendant than on the codefendants. An appellate court will not disturb a negotiated plea if the plea is just and proper in relation to the facts of the case. Discretion in the imposition of sentence rests with the trial court and should not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion (People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).
The sentence imposed here is within the statutory limits and is not objectionable on those grounds. However, we conclude that, in view of the circumstances of this case, County Court abused its discretion as evidenced by the disparity of the sentence imposed on this defendant. While we do not minimize the gravity of the crime, the interest of justice dictates a modification of defendant’s sentence in this case to that imposed on the other two codefendants. This defendant’s guilt was commensurate with that of his codefendants, defendant’s prior record did not call for harsher treatment, and, finally, the prosecutor, in recommending to County Court a sentence of six months’ imprisonment and five years’ probation, indicated that one of the codefendants was more culpable since he masterminded the crime. Accordingly, we modify defendant’s sentence by reducing his prison term to time already served and imposing a term of probation (see, Penal Law § 65.00 [3] [a] [i]), the conditions of which shall be fixed by County Court.
Judgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed in accordance with the terms of this decision; matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith; and, as so modified, affirmed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered February 3, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Satisfying a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain as a second felony offender to 3½ years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree and affirm. Defendant, who has an extensive criminal history, agreed to the sentence as part of a negotiated plea resolution. Accordingly, we find neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Strauss, 16 AD3d 707, 708 [2005]).

Charged with four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and four counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant initially pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. As part of this plea agreement, which defendant acknowledged was uncoerced, defendant was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing in exchange for cooperating with law enforcement officials in drug investigations. When defendant’s cooperation proved valueless, the agreement was terminated and defendant was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.
Subsequently, defendant again pleaded guilty, this time to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Some two weeks later, on the day of his sentencing, however, defendant, claiming that his plea was the product of threats directed at himself and his family by local drug bosses, moved to withdraw his plea. According to defendant, the threats were engendered by a letter that he had written a police investigator following the termination of his original plea agreement wherein defendant identified and agreed to cooperate in apprehending local drug dealers, which letter was allegedly circulated within the drug community.
County Court, finding defendant’s credibility wanting, denied the motion and sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant’s subsequent CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the guilty plea was similarly denied. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and the order denying his postconviction motion.
Preliminarily, we note that defendant’s relinquishment of his right to appeal does not, as the People suggest, preclude him from challenging the voluntariness of the plea (see, People v Seaburg, 74 NY2d 1, 10-11). As to the merits, it is well settled that “ ‘[t]he question of whether [a] defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and a hearing will be granted only in rare instances’ ” (People v Ross, 182 AD2d 1022, 1024, lv dismissed 80 NY2d 934, quoting People v De Gaspard, 170 AD2d 835, 837, lv denied 77 NY2d 994). Here, we find no error in County Court’s denial, without a hearing, of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea. The record reveals that County Court afforded defendant a reasonable opportunity to advance the basis for his request and made relevant inquiries of defendant with respect thereto. Furthermore, a review of the plea allocution confirms that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and that he forthrightly acknowledged his guilt. Given these circumstances, County Court cannot be faulted for failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing (see generally, People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927; People v De Gaspard, supra, at 837; People v Kafka, 128 AD2d 895, lv denied 69 NY2d 951).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, J.), rendered July 28, 2004, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon our previous review of this matter, we relieved defendant’s counsel of his assignment, finding that, contrary to his contention, there is at least one issue of arguable merit to be raised on appeal (24 AD3d 1034 [2005]).
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison. On appeal, defendant’s sentence was vacated due to the People’s failure to file a second felony offender statement as required by CPL 400.21 and the matter was remitted to County Court for resentencing (8 AD3d 904 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]). At resentencing, the People filed the requisite second felony offender statement. Upon receiving the statement, defendant admitted the allegations contained therein. However, defendant thereafter informed the court, through counsel, that he “intends to challenge the constitutionality of the conviction . . . just acknowledged.” Rather than make any further inquiry or hold a hearing on this issue, County Court concluded that defendant could raise any constitutional challenges on appeal and proceeded to resentence defendant, as a second felony offender, to 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Upon learning that defendant was contesting the constitutionality of his prior felony conviction, County Court should have made an inquiry to ascertain the nature of his challenge and to afford him the opportunity to specify the basis therefor (see People v Katz, 214 AD2d 586, 586 [1995]; People v Chestnut, 188 AD2d 480, 481 [1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 883 [1993]; see also People v Schnackenberg, 269 AD2d 618, 619 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 925 [2000]; People v Quattlebaum, 229 AD2d 729, 729 [1996], lv denied 90 NY2d 896 [1997]). As the court failed to do so, we are compelled to remit the matter for redetermination of defendant’s status as a second felony offender and resentencing (see People v Katz, supra at 586; People v Chestnut, supra at 481).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered June 30, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that County Court abused its discretion in failing to grant him youthful offender status and in sentencing him to a prison term of of 2 Vs to 7 years. Despite defendant’s lack of a prior criminal record, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s refusal to grant defendant youthful offender status in light of the seriousness of the offense and evidence of other violent conduct by defendant (see, People v Barriera, 172 AD2d 319, lv denied 78 NY2d 961; People v Carter, 143 AD2d 925, lv denied 73 NY2d 853). As to the sentence imposed, although it is the harshest allowed for the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty, defendant’s plea was in satisfaction of a four-count indictment against him. In addition, the People agreed as part of the plea arrangement not to pursue other charges then pending against defendant. Finally, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he could receive the sentence ultimately imposed. Under these circumstances, we find no basis for disturbing the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Rodriguez, 187 AD2d 752, lv denied 81 NY2d 793; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered April 13, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. On this appeal, defendant challenges only the severity of his sentence, requesting that we exercise our authority to modify it in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]). Acknowledging that defendant was only 19 years of age at the time of conviction, that he has support from his friends and family and that he has made certain improvements in his life while incarcerated, we remain unpersuaded that his sentence should be modified.
On November 29, 1999, defendant was convicted of misdemeanor charges involving unlawful possession of marihuana and unlawful dealing with a child. The felony convictions stem from his having made, on five separate occasions during the months of September and October 1999, sales of cocaine to an undercover State Police Investigator. His 10-count indictment included at least two A-I felonies. He was allowed to plead to two A-II felonies—in full satisfaction of the indictment—on condition that he receive two concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of SVs years to life. The sentencing minutes reflect his full understanding of the bargain. While the sentence imposed was the maximum for an A-II felony, it is within the permissible statutory range and the record reveals no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances. Hence, we decline to disturb it (see, People v Britt, 283 AD2d 778, 781, lv denied 96 NY2d 916; People v Spencer, 272 AD2d 682, 685, lv denied 95 NY2d 858; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Madison County (DiStefano, J.), rendered January 4, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant collided with a State Police vehicle on the New York State Thruway in Madison County and, in the inquiry that ensued, cocaine and marihuana were found in his possession. He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him, as agreed, to a prison term of four years to be followed by postrelease supervision of five years. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.
During the plea colloquy, defendant stated that he understood the terms of the plea agreement, which included the requirement that he waive his right to appeal the conviction and sentence. He was then advised at sentencing with regard to the separate and distinct rights he was forfeiting by waiving his right to appeal, discussed the issue with counsel to his satisfaction, and both executed a written appeal waiver and professed his continuing willingness to do so if the agreed-upon sentence was imposed. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013]; People v Collins, 53 AD3d 932, 933 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 831 [2008]).
Defendant’s further contention that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is unpreserved, inasmuch as the record does not indicate that he moved to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gruber, 108 AD3d 877, 877 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 956 [2013]; People v Stroman, 107 AD3d 1023, 1025 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]). He further made no statements during the plea colloquy that called either his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea into question and, accordingly, this case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine (see id.).
Defendant’s remaining argument, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d at 1045).

In satisfaction of four felony drug charges, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and he executed a written waiver of his right to appeal in open court and orally waived his appeal rights after County Court explained them on the record. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to a maximum of six years in prison to be followed by anywhere from 3 to 5 years of postrelease supervision. Prior to sentencing, it was agreed that sentencing would be held in abeyance pending defendant’s participation in a substance abuse treatment program, the successful completion of which would entitle him to withdraw his plea, plead guilty to a misdemeanor and be sentenced to time served. Defendant failed to successfully complete the program and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. He now appeals.
Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, defense counsel’s brief and defendant’s pro se submission, we agree. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal. Inasmuch as he did not satisfactorily complete the substance abuse treatment program, he was not entitled to a reduced sentence. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed and counsel’s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered February 27, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In April 2003, defendant was arrested in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County, after making a sale of rock cocaine to an undercover police officer. Defendant was subsequently indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Upon arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty, and the People announced their readiness for trial and requested that the indictment be transferred to the trial calendar.
Thereafter, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds (see CPL 30.30), which motion was denied. Defendant then pleaded guilty in accordance with a negotiated plea agreement to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of 472 to 9 years and waived his right to appeal.
Defendant claims that he was deprived of his right to a speedy trial pursuant to the provisions of CPL 30.30 apparently on the ground that at the time the People declared their readiness (clearly within the statute’s time constraints), laboratory results had not been received and the People therefore could not have been ready to proceed. As we previously have observed, the lack of a laboratory report is not required to support an indictment. “Thus, it necessarily follows that the lack of such a report would not mandate a trial order of dismissal since the standard for judging the legal sufficiency of evidence before a grand jury is the same as that for judging a motion for a trial order of dismissal” (People v Van Hoesen, 12 AD3d 5, 8 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 804 [2005] [citations omitted]). Thus, the fact that formal laboratory results are not obtained by the People prior to the expiration of the statutory speedy trial period does not require a finding, that the statement of readiness was illusory (see People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888, 890 [2005]).
We likewise reject defendant’s contention that his plea was not voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently made. The record makes plain that defendant was fully advised of the consequences of his plea, including those rights he would be waiving, and that such plea was knowingly and voluntarily made. Throughout the plea allocution, defendant indicated that he understood County Court’s admonitions, that he wished to plead guilty and that he was not coerced or threatened into doing so.
We also reject defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The principal basis for defendant’s contention is that defense counsel was guilty of gross negligence in encouraging defendant to accept the plea offer. Defense counsel’s conduct in encouraging defendant to accept the plea bargain here was nothing more than the product of reasonable and legitimate strategy in the best interest of defendant. Indeed, defendant was well advised by counsel to plead guilty and avoid a trial, considering the likelihood that the People would have been able to secure a conviction and defendant’s sentence thereon would have been considerably harsher than that to which he agreed.
Finally, with regard to defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we decline to address the issue. While it is clear that we have the authority to review such a claim in the interest of justice, defendant’s decision to waive his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement represents his decision to foreclose review of the sentence (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]). We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered January 30, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an eight-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a prior felony offender to a prison term of five years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, contending that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, “County Court was not obligated to expressly advise defendant of his right to contest the constitutionality of the prior conviction” (People v Wilkins, 118 AD3d 1038, 1039 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Here, the record demonstrates that defendant was provided with the prior felony information at sentencing and, after a discussion with his counsel, affirmed that he did not contest the prior felony statement and admitted that he previously was convicted of that felony. Under these circumstances, County Court substantially complied with the requirements of CPL 400.21 (3) and properly sentenced defendant as a second felony offender (see id. at 1039; People v Wood, 108 AD3d 932, 933 [2013]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County, rendered September 21, 1970, upon a 1969 plea of guilty to criminally selling a dangerous drug in the second degree (Penal Law, § 220.35), the original sentence having been vacated because of a failure to advise defendant as to a right to appeal and defendant having been resentenced nunc pro tunc upon the previous guilty plea to an indeterminate term for a maximum period of nine years. Defendant was indicted in a multiple count indictment charged with the criminal sale and possession of dangerous drugs and, thereafter, was permitted to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and enter one of guilty to the first count charging criminally selling a dangerous drug in the second degree in violation of section 220.35, in disposition of the indictment. Upon resentencing defendant, in the presence of his attorney, stated that the reason he entered a guilty plea was so that he “would get the narcotics program” and, if this be interpreted as an application to withdraw said plea, the County Court did not err or abuse its discretion in not granting same since defendant, who stated he was changing his plea because he was guilty and for no other reason, did not present nor does the record reveal justification for such withdrawal (cf. People v. McKennion, 27 N Y 2d 671; People v. Beasley, 25 N Y 2d 483, 488). In connection with a coram nobis application determined by an order entered September 16, 1970, the County Court found, after a hearing, that defendant was not deceived into pleading guilty by anyone, although he did indicate after the imposition of sentence that he was disappointed as to the extent of the sentence.

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered February 22, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a con trolled substance in the first degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and a number of other counts as the result of an October 8, 1993 incident when cocaine, a scale and a weapon were found in the vehicle in which he was traveling on the Thruway. On October 7, 1994, defendant disposed of the indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The plea was given and accepted as part of a plea bargain that provided for defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal but ensured that his sentence would not exceed a $5,000 fine and a prison term of four years to life so long as he personally appeared for sentencing and committed no additional crimes prior to that time.
At a December 28, 1994 appearance in County Court, defendant indicated that he intended to move to withdraw his plea of guilty. Defendant was advised to make the motion in writing, returnable January 10, 1995. As of that date, no motion papers had been filed with County Court. The parties appeared the following day and defendant’s counsel explained that the motion papers had been prepared but defendant was unwilling to sign them because he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea. At the same time, defendant wanted his counsel to pursue what he believed to be a meritorious statutory speedy trial claim. First defendant’s counsel and then County Court advised defendant of the fact that, absent successful withdrawal of his guilty plea, he could not pursue a CPL 30.30 motion. In addition, defendant was advised that if he was successful .in his effort to withdraw his guilty plea but the ensuing CPL 30.30 motion was denied, there could be no assurance that the plea bargain would still be available. Simply stated, it was made patently clear to defendant that he was required to make an election.
The parties next appeared in County Court on January 13, 1995 and defendant continued in his effort to pursue the statutory speedy trial issue orally and in the absence of any written motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In the course of his recitation, defendant challenged the ability and honesty of his counsel to the point where the latter sought to be relieved of assignment. County Court granted the motion. Defendant then appeared on February 22, 1995 with new assigned counsel. After asking a number of questions of County Court and the District Attorney concerning the dates of certain prior appearanees and proceedings, defendant indicated that he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea but desired to proceed with sentencing. Sentenced in accordance with his plea bargain, defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we note that defendant’s failure to move to withdraw or to vacate his guilty plea precludes appellate review of the contention that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Hayes, 208 AD2d 1054, lv denied 85 NY2d 910; People v Espinal, 176 AD2d 417). In any event, our review of the proceedings in County Court offers no support for defendant’s claims that his lack of education, inability to communicate with his counsel, confusion or any other disability or condition prevented him from knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entering a plea of guilty and waiving his right to appeal. Rather, the record demonstrates an unwavering pattern of duplicity on defendant’s part wherein he doggedly attempts to pursue his CPL 30.30 claim without giving up his advantageous plea bargain. At the time of sentencing, defendant’s tactics escalated into a transparent effort to impair the record with comments such as ""How could I go to trial,” ""I have no choice but to accept,” and ""I cannot go to trial, because the lawyers said they cannot answer the questions that I ask them, because they say they don’t know.” Notwithstanding these and other similar remarks by defendant, we perceive no valid basis for a finding that defendant’s plea of guilty or the waiver of his right to appeal were not properly received or, once given, should have been vacated. Accordingly, the waiver of appeal will be enforced (see, People v Sledge, 195 AD2d 713, lv denied 82 NY2d 903).
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and found lacking in merit.

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered July 1, 2002, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after she was found with 36 small plastic bags containing crack cocaine. She pleaded guilty to that charge in exchange for a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probation. Defendant also agreed to waive her right to appeal and was administered Parker warnings advising her that the agreed-upon sentence would not be honored if she committed another crime prior to sentencing. When it was discovered that the agreed-upon sentence could only be imposed with respect to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant pleaded guilty to that charge.
Thereafter, defendant testified at the trial of her boyfriend against whom various drug charges were pending and indicated that it was her, rather than him, who sold drugs to the undercover police officer on the date in question. As a result of her testimony, the District Attorney requested that defendant’s sentence be enhanced to 2 to 6 years in prison. Upon finding that the plea agreement had not been fulfilled, County Court granted the request and sentenced defendant to 2 to 6 years in prison.
Defendant asserts that County Court improperly enhanced her sentence based upon her failure to cooperate in the prosecution of her boyfriend, a condition not specified in the plea agreement. Initially, we note that while waivers of appeal are generally enforceable, defendant’s waiver does not preclude her challenge here inasmuch as it “was predicated upon the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence and should not be enforced where certain conditions or terms were never clearly set forth at the plea proceeding” (People v Haslow, 20 AD3d 680, 680-681 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 828 [2005]; see People v Branch-El, 12 AD3d 785, 786 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 761 [2005]). Furthermore, although defendant did not properly preserve her claim by moving to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]; People v Baxter, 302 AD2d 950, 951 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]), we, nevertheless, exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction given the particular circumstances herein (see CPL 470.15 [6]). Nowhere in this record does it indicate that defendant’s cooperation in the prosecution of her boyfriend was a condition of the plea agreement. Although Parker warnings were administered, they did not include any requirement by defendant with respect to the proceedings against her boyfriend. Consequently, there is no basis for the finding that defendant breached a term of the plea agreement resulting in the imposition of an enhanced sentence (see People v Caldwell, 308 AD2d 658, 659 [2003]; People v Covell, 276 AD2d 824, 826 [2000]). Defendant is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.

Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentence imposed; matter remitted to the County Court of Clinton County for resentencing in accordance with this Court’s decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.
We note that, although defendant has been released from prison, she is nonetheless on parole and her appeal is therefore not moot (see People v Stewart, 185 AD2d 381, 382 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 977 [1992]; see also People v Rowell, 5 AD3d 1073 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 806 [2004]; compare People v Wemette, 285 AD2d 729, 731-732 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 689 [2001]).",,659,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"The defendant was indicted by a Grand Jury on seven counts of drug-related crimes for selling cocaine to members of the Dutchess County Drug Task Force. The defendant accepted a plea agreement which permitted him to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment. In exchange for his guilty plea, the defendant was promised a sentence of six years to life imprisonment.
At sentencing the County Court imposed the agreed-upon term of imprisonment and the defendant subsequently moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, on the grounds of ""newly-discovered evidence”, i.e., that the Dutchess County Drug Task Force was not a legally-authorized organization at the time of its operations against the defendant, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The County Court denied the motion. The defendant has been granted permission to appeal from this order.
The defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel’s failure to argue that the Dutchess County Drug Task Force was not a legally-authorized organization at the time of its operations against the defendant on April 6, 1989, is without merit. We find that since the Task Force members are police officers from participating municipalities they had the authority to secure a warrant and arrest the defendant based upon his illegal drug activity despite the fact that the agreement authorizing the Task Force was not executed until July 20, 1989 (see, People v Martin, 163 AD2d 536). Having determined that members of the Dutchess County Drug Task Force had the authority to act prior to July 20, 1989, the defendant’s allegation that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based upon his court-appointed attorney’s failure to raise that issue must fail. Moreover, we find that the defendant has made no factual showing whatsoever to dispel the inference of effective representation arising from the highly favorable plea agreement his counsel negotiated (see, People v St. John, 163 AD2d 687).
The defendant’s term of imprisonment was imposed in accordance with the plea agreement and we find no basis for modifying it on appeal (see, People v Kazespis, 101 AD2d 816).
We have considered the defendant’s remaining contentions, including those raised in his supplemental pro se brief, and find them to be without merit. Thompson, J.

"Kane, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered April 7, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts) after a search of premises associated with defendant uncovered a quantity of cocaine, a scale and plastic baggies. Defendant moved to suppress this evidence, but before a suppression hearing could be held, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant, a second felony offender, was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review because defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Barnes, 302 AD2d 623, 623 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]; People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617 [1999]). In any event, County Court conducted a thorough plea colloquy, ascertaining that defendant was thinking clearly, was not under duress and understood the nature and consequences of his guilty plea. Further, defendant admitted committing acts satisfying each element of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law § 220.16 [1]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.
We reject defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is predicated on counsel’s failure to make certain pretrial motions and allegedly deficient discussions with defendant. Notably, defendant did not make a CPL 440.10 motion by which a record of counsel’s preparations and client consultations could have been developed (see People v Jones, 55 NY2d 771, 773 [1981]; People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810, 811 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 675 [2002]; People v Paige, 289 AD2d 872, 873 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 759 [2002]). Further, counsel’s failure to make a particular pretrial motion does not, in itself, constitute ineffective assistance (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Rodriguez, 303 AD2d 783, 785-786 [2003]; People v Paige, supra). Viewing the totality of the circumstance of this case, and in light of the favorable plea agreement and reduction in defendant’s sentencing exposure, we conclude that counsel provided meaningful representation (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812 [1997], lv denied 92 NY2d 850 [1998]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered July 21, 2011, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information (hereinafter SCI) charging her with attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. She pleaded guilty to this charge and waived her right to appeal. She was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to five years of probation. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the SCI is jurisdictionally defective because it does not contain sufficient factual allegations of the material elements of the crime in question. Preliminarily, we note that this claim is not precluded by defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal or her guilty plea (see People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]; People v Binns, 82 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2011]). Nevertheless, we find it to be without merit. A charging instrument that incorporates by reference the statutory provisions applicable to the crime charged has been held to allege the material elements of the crime sufficiently to survive a jurisdictional challenge (see People v D'Angelo, 98 NY2d 733, 734-735 [2002]; People v Mitchell, 94 AD3d 1252, 1252-1253 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]; People v Binns, 82 AD3d at 1450; People v Downs, 26 AD3d 525, 526 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 847 [2006]). Here, not only does the SCI specifically refer to Penal Law §§ 110.00 and 220.39 (1), but it also contains factual references to the date and location of the incident as well as the specific drug involved. Accordingly, there is no jurisdictional defect and defendant is precluded by her guilty plea from otherwise challenging the factual sufficiency of the SCI (see People v Morales, 66 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (LaBuda, J.), rendered May 5, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty of the first count which charged criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal and, after his motion to withdraw the plea was denied, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon indeterminate prison term of 6 to 16 years. Defendant appeals challenging, inter alia, the legality of the sentence.
Pursuant to Penal Law § 70.06 (4) (b), “the minimum period of imprisonment under an indeterminate sentence for a second felony offender must be fixed by the court at one-half of the maximum term imposed and must be specified in the sentence.” When County Court established defendant’s status as a second felony offender, the enhanced minimum term was mandatory (see, People v Palmer, 176 AD2d 995, 997, lv denied 79 NY2d 951). Thus, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence imposed by the court clearly did not comply with the mandate of Penal Law § 70.06 (4) (b).
Relying on People v Martin (278 AD2d 743), the People argue that the appropriate remedy is to reduce the maximum term of defendant’s sentence to 12 years. In the Martin case, this Court acknowledged that “where the agreed-upon sentence is illegal n because it is greater than the legal maximum, the imposition of a legal sentence does not necessarily deprive a defendant of the benefit of the plea bargain. Rather, in such instances, the courts have seen fit to reduce the sentence without affording the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea” (id., at 744). In this case, however, the sentence is not greater than the legal maximum. The 16-year maximum term is legally permissible for a class B felony (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]) and the 6-year minimum term does not exceed the statutorily mandated one half of the maximum. In any event, contrary to the remedy proposed by the People, the statutory sentencing scheme for second felony offenders does not contemplate the use of the minimum term to calculate a permissible maximum term. Rather, the sentencing court must first fix a permissible maximum term and then impose a minimum term of one half of the maximum.
Where, as here, “the plea bargain includes a sentence which is illegal because the minimum imposed is less than that required by law, this Court has held that the proper remedy is to vacate the sentence and afford the defendant, having been denied the benefit of the bargain, the opportunity to withdraw the plea” (People v Martin, supra, at 744; see, People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941). Inasmuch as defendant moved prior to sentencing to withdraw his plea on this ground and argues on appeal that County Court erred in denying the motion, we are of the view that the appropriate remedy in this case is to vacate both the plea and the sentence, and to restore the case to the preplea stage.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered January 26, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment with the understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of between 8 and 10 years, and the plea agreement included a waiver of the right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to nine years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was valid. Both County Court and the detailed written waiver executed by defendant in open court informed him that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea, and the court confirmed that he had discussed the waiver with counsel and understood its ramifications. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Pandori, 133 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2015]; People v Mayo, 130 AD3d 1099, 1099-1100 [2015]). Defendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes him from challenging his sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Smith, 137 AD3d 1425, 1426 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1075 [2016]; People v Forget, 136 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 929 [2016]).
As to defendant’s remaining claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as the claim relates to sentencing and not the voluntariness of his plea, this claim is also precluded by his appeal waiver (see People v White, 47 AD3d 1062, 1063 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 818 [2008]; People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]). In any event, we find the claim to be unpersuasive. Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to counsel submitting a lengthy presentence memorandum too close to the sentencing date to allow County Court to properly evaluate it when determining his sentence. County Court stated that it had reviewed the memorandum prior to sentencing, however, and defense counsel orally made the case for a more lenient sentence based upon defendant’s medical records before County Court imposed sentence. Accordingly, if this issue were properly before us, we would find that it was without merit (see People v Johnson, 267 AD2d 609, 610 [1999]).

After defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the People had violated his statutory right to a speedy trial was denied (see CPL 30.30), he pleaded guilty to three charges contained in the indictment, including one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was later determined to be a second felony drug offender who had been previously convicted of a violent felony, and was sentenced to six years in prison, plus three years of postrelease supervision (see Penal Law § 70.70 [1] [b], [c]; [4] [a]). Defendant now appeals, claiming that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial and was improperly classified for sentencing purposes as a second felony offender who had been previously convicted of a prior violent felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [4] [a], [b] [i]).
Initially, we note that when defendant entered his guilty plea “he forfeited his right to claim that he was deprived of a speedy trial under CPL 30.30” (People v O’Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]; see People v Zakrzewski, 69 AD3d 1055 [2010], Iv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]). As for his classification as a second felony drug offender who had been previously convicted of a prior violent felony, such classification was based on defendant’s 1999 conviction for attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law § 265.02 [former (4)]). A plea of guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law § 265.02) is a violent felony offense if, when entered, the plea was to a “ ‘lesser grade’ ” of an offense in the indictment that qualifies as a violent felony (People v Dickerson, 85 NY2d 870, 872 [1995], quoting CPL 220.20; see Penal Law § 70.02 [1] [d]). Defendant argues that County Court should not have classified his prior conviction as a violent felony offense because the accusatory instrument used in that proceeding was a superior court information — and not an indictment— and, as such, his guilty plea to the lesser grade offense cannot qualify as a violent felony. We disagree. A “superior court information has the same force and effect as an indictment and all procedures and provisions of law applicable to indictments are also applicable to superior court informations, except where otherwise expressly provided” (CPL 200.15). Moreover, “[e]xcept as used in [a]rticle 190, the term indictment shall include a superior court information” (CPL 200.10). Thus, defendant’s plea to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree was properly determined to be a violent felony offense (see Penal Law § 70.02 [1] [d]; People v Henry, 52 AD3d 841, 843 [2008], Iv denied 11 NY3d 789 [2008]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Lamont, J.), rendered April 30, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty in March 2009 to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison sentence of 41/2 years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. At sentencing, with the People’s consent, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a reduced term of four years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s lone contention on this appeal is that, consistent with the intent of recent drug law reform, his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice from incarceration to a treatment program. Initially we note that, as defendant concedes, the change in the law has no application to his circumstances (see CPL 216.05). Furthermore, based upon our review of the record, defendant’s criminal history and the favorable plea bargain that he received, we do not find that County Court abused its discretion, nor are there extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the lawful, agreed-upon sentence (see People v Savage, 72 AD3d 1292 [2010]; People v Darby, 72 AD3d 1280, 1284 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 747 [2010]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered March 8, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Upon pleading guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal posses sion of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced to three concurrent terms of imprisonment of 6 to 18 years. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that this sentence is harsh and excessive. Not only did defendant plead guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, but his plea was in satisfaction of three separate indictments charging him with eight drug-related felonies. In addition, it cannot be said that County Court failed to perform the delicate balancing necessary to accommodate the public and private interests involved in the sentencing process. Given these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentenced imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County, rendered March 27, 1969, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree, in violation of section 220.30 of the Penal Law. Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of not more than three years. We find no merit in appellant’s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his application to require the prosecution to furnish him any sworn statement made by a law enforcement official concerning dealings between such official and one Richard Hogue, an alleged informant. (See People v. Oleary, 33 A D 2d 814.) The denial by the trial court of appellant’s request for inspection of the probation report was a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court. (People v. Michael O. [Anonymous], 22 N Y 2d 831.) Similarly, the refusal of the trial court to permit appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty more than two months after the entry of the plea was a proper exercise of discretion, since appellant produced no facts sufficient to warrant such relief. (People V. Gowasky, 244 N. Y. 451; People v. Mangan, 16 A D 2d 986.) We have examined the remainder of appellant’s contentions and find them to be without merit. Judgment affirmed. Reynolds, J.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Marlow, J.), dated June 4, 1996, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing as sentence an indeterminate term of 12V2 to 25 years imprisonment for each conviction, with the terms of imprisonment imposed for the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under the first count of the indictment and criminal possession of a controlled substance under the second count of the indictment to run consecutively to the terms of imprisonment imposed on the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under the third count of the indictment and criminal possession of a controlled substance under the fourth count of the indictment, and to otherwise run concurrently to each other.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed from indeterminate terms of 12V2 to 25 years imprisonment to indeterminate terms of 10 to 20 years imprisonment, to run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10; People v Udzinski, 146 AD2d 245). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt (see, People v Reed, 256 AD2d 365). Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), rendered June 29, 2011, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (seven counts), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and a new trial is ordered.
During pretrial proceedings, the defendant unsuccessfully moved to relieve his counsel. Shortly thereafter, at the outset of a pretrial hearing pursuant to People v Rodriguez (79 NY2d 445 [1992]), the defendant made his first of three timely applications to proceed pro se. As he did so, he referred to the recent denial of his motion to relieve his counsel, and the County Court made clear that his counsel would be his “last attorney.” When the court asked the defendant why he wanted to represent himself, he explained that his counsel failed to challenge a search warrant and failed to take up a “number of issues” that the defendant wanted to raise. At that point, defense counsel went on record stating that, in his view, there was no good faith basis upon which to challenge the search warrant, the legal arguments raised by the defendant were not relevant, and his client was like a “broken record” and was asking him “to do certain things that [he didn’t] agree with.” The court then asked the defendant questions to determine whether he was knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to counsel and whether his request to proceed pro se was unequivocal. The court also questioned the defendant about his level of education and tested his knowledge of the law. Although the defendant’s desire to represent himself was unequivocal, the court denied his application, in part because the defendant was admittedly not prepared to proceed that day with the Rodriguez hearing. The court also made clear, however, that the defendant could renew his application prior to trial.
Four months later, before a different Judge and at the outset of a pretrial hearing pursuant to People v Sandoval (34 NY2d 371 [1974]), defense counsel moved to be relieved. The motion was denied. The defendant then renewed his application to proceed pro se. The County Court summarily denied the application, relying on the questioning of the defendant by the prior Judge. At that point, defense counsel explained that he and the defendant were “very much at odds over the strategy” and indicated that he “[did] not want to act as an agent for [the defendant’s] witness tampering.” When the defendant vigorously objected to his own counsel’s use of the term “witness tampering,” defense counsel told him to “shut [his] mouth for a minute” and implored the court to let the defendant represent himself, adding that he should not “be held here prisoner for this garbage.” The court refused to either relieve defense counsel or allow the defendant to proceed pro se.
Finally, just before the start of jury selection, defense counsel once again, renewed the defendant’s application to represent himself. The County Court reiterated that it was relying on the prior Judge’s searching inquiry and conclusion that the defend ant was unable to represent himself, which the court had “no reason to upset.”
“A defendant in a criminal case may invoke the right to defend pro se provided: (1) the request is unequivocal and timely asserted, (2) there has been a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, and (3) the defendant has not engaged in conduct which would prevent the fair and orderly exposition of the issues” (People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d 10, 17 [1974]; see People v Smith, 68 NY2d 737, 738 [1986]).
Here, the defendant made three timely applications to proceed pro se. Contrary to the People’s contention, the fact that these applications were accompanied by unsuccessful requests for new counsel did not, under the circumstances, render the applications equivocal (see People v Malone, 119 AD3d 1352, 1354 [2014]; People v Lewis, 114 AD3d 402, 404 [2014]; cf. People v Gillian, 8 NY3d 85 [2006]). Rather, the defendant’s repetitious, explicit reassertions of his right at every opportunity served to dispel any possible misunderstanding of his intentions or of his sincerity in desiring to represent himself (see People v Davis, 49 NY2d 114, 119 [1979]).
As to the second requirement that the defendant’s waiver of counsel be knowing and intelligent, the record shows that the County Court’s precautionary inquiry and warnings to the defendant regarding the perils of representing himself and the value of legal representation were sufficient to impress upon him the dangers and disadvantages of giving up the fundamental right to counsel (see Faretta v California, 422 US 806, 835 [1975]; People v White, 56 NY2d 110, 117 [1982]; People v Powe, 234 AD2d 397, 397 [1996]).
To the extent that the County Court based its denial of the defendant’s application on the ground that he had a history of mental illness, this was error. “New York courts can, in appropriate circumstances, deny a self-representation request if a severely-mentally-ill defendant who is competent to stand trial otherwise lacks the mental capacity to waive counsel and proceed pro se” (People v Stone, 22 NY3d 520, 527 [2014]). This is not such a case. While the defendant acknowledged prior hospitalizations for mental illness, there is no indication in the record that the defendant was severely mentally ill at the time he made his requests to proceed pro se, or that any mental condition at that time rendered him incapable of intelligently and voluntarily waiving his right to counsel and representing himself.
To the extent that the County Court based its denial of the defendant’s application on his failure to correctly answer the prior Judge’s questions about certain legal terms, the Court of Appeals has pointed out that “ [t] o accept a defendant’s lack of knowledge of legal principles and rules of law or his unfamiliarity with courtroom procedures as the ground for concluding that he is not qualified to represent himself would in effect be to eviscerate the constitutional right of self-representation; such limitations could confidently be said to exist in nearly every criminal case in which the defendant had not received legal training” (People v Davis, 49 NY2d at 120; see People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d at 17-18). In fact, the defendant informed the court that he had represented himself twice before in civil matters, attended a legal research class provided by the Department of Corrections, worked in a prison law library, and obtained a certificate in legal research and basic law library management. Under such circumstances, “[t]he inference may be drawn that the trial court — unquestionably in furtherance of what it perceived to be defendant’s best interests — was determined to deny defendant’s applications no matter what he said or what the record otherwise showed” (People v Davis, 49 NY2d at 120).
With regard to the third and final prong of the McIntyre test, there is no indication in the record that the defendant’s overall conduct was disruptive, obstreperous, or “calculated to undermine, upset or unreasonably delay the progress of the trial” (People v McIntyre, 36 NY2d at 18; see People v Schoolfield, 196 AD2d 111, 117 [1994]).
What is perhaps most troubling about this record is that the County Court would neither agree to relieve defense counsel, even after he took positions that were plainly adverse to his client (see People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 966 [2013]), nor permit the defendant to proceed pro se, despite his timely and unequivocal requests to do so. This placed the defendant in an untenable position.
Since the denial of the right of self-representation is not subject to harmless error analysis (see People v LaValle, 3 NY3d 88, 106 [2004]), the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered (see People v Forney, 303 AD2d 763 [2003]; People v Tejada, 289 AD2d 516 [2001]).
We note that the People correctly concede on appeal that the terms of the defendant’s postrelease supervision were illegal. The range of postrelease supervision permitted upon conviction, as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction, is IV2 to 3 years (see Penal Law §§ 70.70 [1] [b]; [4] [b] [i]; 70.45 [2] [d]), whereas here, the County Court imposed terms of five years.
The defendant’s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se supplemental brief, are without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered April 9, 2004 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in connection with his sale of approximately 14 grams of cocaine to a confidential informant in exchange for $1,000 in cash. Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and, although defendant failed to appear at sentencing, Supreme Court sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement as a predicate felon to SVa to 11 years in prison. On defendant’s appeal, we affirm.
Defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing, arguing then and now on appeal that he is innocent and was pressured into pleading guilty. Supreme Court reviewed the transcript of the plea colloquy and gave defendant and his attorney an opportunity to be heard on the issue before denying defendant’s motion. Mindful that the decision to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and having reviewed the plea colloquy and found that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and informed plea, in the course of which he made sufficient factual admissions to establish his guilt, we find no reason to disturb Supreme Court’s decision to deny defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 631-632 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; People v Babcock, 304 AD2d 912, 912 [2003]).
Next, we find defendant’s challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress the buy money found in his possession unpersuasive. Defendant’s contention that the People failed to demonstrate the reliability of the confidential informant is inapposite given the fact that the confidential informant did not testify at the suppression hearing; indeed, the testimony of the officers involved in the arrest established that the police directly monitored the buy and, thus, obtained sufficient information to establish probable cause to make the arrest and seize the money without relying on any statements or observation made by the confidential informant (see People v Williams, 25 AD3d 927, 928-929 [2006]; People v Mendoza, 5 AD3d 810, 813 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 644 [2004]).
Finally, we find no evidence that Supreme Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to the agreed upon sentence and no extraordinary circumstances which would persuade us to reduce defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Williams, supra at 929; People v Youmans, 11 AD3d 823 [2004]; People v Calkins, 6 AD3d 744, 746 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 671 [2004]).

"—Harvey, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered April 5, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was out on parole on an unrelated felony when he was arrested and later charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following plea negotiations, defendant agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an unrelated misdemeanor charge. In exchange, defendant was to be given a prison sentence of 3½ to 7 years. Because defendant was a second felony offender and he had been out on parole for an unfulfilled sentence at the time of the new arrest, it was explained to defendant that his new sentence had to be consecutive to his unfulfilled sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.25 [2-a]). Prior to the conclusion of the proceedings defense counsel reserved the right to withdraw the plea if the sentence was not as understood. At sentencing, defendant’s attorney was not present and a Legal Aid attorney was substituted. When defendant seemed a little confused by the proceedings, County Court offered to adjourn sentencing until the following Monday when defendant’s original attorney could be present. After thinking the matter over, defendant agreed to be sentenced at that time in accordance with the plea bargain. This appeal followed.
Defendant’s argument that his plea was neither knowing nor voluntary was not preserved for appellate review because defendant failed to move in County Court to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Strohecker, 170 AD2d 891; People v McGourty, 153 AD2d 991). In any event, our review of the minutes and terms of the plea bargain reveals no basis for reversal on this ground. While defendant correctly states that ""the breach of a promise made to induce a guilty plea entitles a defendant to either withdraw his plea or be resentenced” by a different sentencing court (People v Felman, 137 AD2d 341, 343, lv denied 72 NY2d 918), in this case no promises were in fact breached (see, People v Henderson, 145 AD2d 676, 677, lv denied 73 NY2d 978). Specifically the consecutive sentence for the agreed-upon crime was clearly stated in the record as required by CPL 220.50 (5). Although it is true that the question of how much jail time defendant might receive as a result of the time he had already spent in jail was briefly discussed, defendant is incorrect in asserting that County Court made a promise in this respect. In fact, since credit for jail time in defendant’s circumstance is provided for by statute (see, Penal Law § 70.30 [3]), no promises could have been made and our review reveals that none in fact were made. We are similarly unpersuaded by the remaining arguments raised in defendant’s brief and, therefore, an affirmance is required.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered July 29, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of an eight-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. He also waived the right to appeal. Sentenced to the agreed-upon parole supervision in an intensive drug treatment program, defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in accepting his plea.
According to defendant, the People had no laboratory report to establish that the substance he sold was a controlled substance and he was unaware of that deficiency in the People’s proof when he entered his plea. To the extent that defendant’s argument constitutes a challenge to the knowing, intelligent and voluntary nature of his plea, that challenge has not been preserved for our review as a result of defendant’s failure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment (see, People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 832). County Court conducted an appropriate plea allocution and the record establishes that this is not one of those rare cases where the court had a duty to inquire further to ensure that defendant’s plea was knowing and voluntary (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666). To the extent that defendant’s argument constitutes a challenge relating to one of the factual elements of the crime charged, that challenge was forfeited by the guilty plea, which removed the issue of factual guilt from the case (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5). There is only a “limited group of questions which survive a plea” (People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993) and defendant’s argument does not involve the type of fundamental matter that is preserved despite the guilty plea (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 5). Finally, defendant’s knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal precludes review of his claim regarding the severity of the sentence (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733), a claim which we would find without merit in any event.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 29, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed by County Court was unduly harsh and should be reduced in the interest of justice.

Given defendant’s criminal history and the fact that the sentence was in accordance with the plea bargain, we conclude that the sentence imposed was not unduly harsh (see, People v Otero, 184 AD2d 484, lv denied 80 NY2d 976; People v Stevens, 178 AD2d 338) and, accordingly, we find no reason to disturb it.

"—Appeál from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered January 31, 1996, convicting defen dant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In full satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced, as a predicate felon, to a prison term of seven years to life. Defendant contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive given the fact that he, inter alia, has a son and a disabled wife, has a history of steady employment and has had success in drug treatment. In light of defendant’s past criminal history, which includes a drug-related conviction, as well as the fact that defendant received the agreed-upon sentence which is within the statutory limits, we reject defendant’s contention and find that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive (see, People v Roldan, 223 AD2d 893, lv denied 88 NY2d 993; People v Martinez, 184 AD2d 869, lv denied 80 NY2d 906). .

"Devine, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Czajka, J.), rendered October 1, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant to 3V2 years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Following his arrest, defendant was arraigned in City Court without an attorney and remanded to jail. The next day, while still unrepresented by counsel, defendant was given written notice that the grand jury presentment was scheduled for that day and that defendant should notify the District Attorney’s office “as soon as possible” if he wanted to appear before the grand jury. Defendant was indicted within hours on the felony charges and, three days later, he was assigned counsel during his arraignment by County Court. More than nine months later and following numerous court appearances, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to provide proper written notice of the right to appear before and provide evidence to the grand jury pursuant to CPL 190.50 (5) (a), which motion was denied as untimely. Defendant now asserts that, because he was denied his constitutional right to counsel at the time of his arraignment by City Court and during grand jury proceedings, his guilty plea must be vacated and the indictment dismissed.
The People maintain that defendant’s waiver of appeal precludes our consideration of defendant’s claim that his right to counsel was violated. A trial court must ensure that a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal is knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1141 [2014]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1259-1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]). After the People informed County Court that defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal, the court asked defendant whether that contention was accurate, to which defendant replied affirmatively. Thereafter, the court questioned defendant about his understanding of the terms of the plea bargain, but failed to confirm that he fully understood that his waiver of appeal was not automatic and that it was, in fact, “separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1265 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]). Defendant signed a written waiver of appeal outside of court and County Court made no inquiry about “the circumstances surrounding the document’s execution” or confirm that defendant had been fully advised by counsel of the document’s significance (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 265). As such, the appeal waiver was invalid (see People v Burgette, 118 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2014]).
On the merits of defendant’s appeal, a criminal defendant’s right to receive the assistance of counsel attaches at arraignment “and entails the presence of counsel at each subsequent critical stage of the proceedings” (Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d 8, 20 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Hilliard, 73 NY2d 584, 586 [1989]). Further, whether an accused individual facing felony charges should elect to appear before and present evidence to the grand jury or, as equally relevant here, object to the timeliness or reasonableness of the notice of grand jury proceedings, raises questions necessitating consultation with legal counsel (see Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d at 21; see also People v Chapman, 69 NY2d 497, 500 [1987]; People v Settles, 46 NY2d 154, 164 [1978]; Matter of Trudeau v Cantwell, 31 AD3d 844, 846 [2006]). The People correctly observe that, by pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his claim that he was denied the statutory right to testify before the grand jury (see People v Straight, 106 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2013]; People v Dennis, 223 AD2d 814, 815 [1996], lv denied 87 NY2d 972 [1996]; People v Lasher, 199 AD2d 595, 595 [1993], lv denied 83 NY2d 855 [1994]) or, as defendant now argues on appeal, that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel where, as here, such assertion does not relate to the voluntariness of the plea or the integrity of the plea bargaining process (see People v Mercer, 81 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 999 [2012]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]). Here, however, it is uncontroverted that defendant was denied the right to counsel prior to and during the grand jury proceedings, a critical stage of the instant criminal prosecution and, therefore, the forfeiture rule should not be applied (see People v Hunt, 277 AD2d 911, 913 [2000]; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d 704, 705 [1989]). Further, we observe that, while defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment was based solely on the denial of his right pursuant to CPL 190.50 (5) (a) to testify before the grand jury, the “claimed deprivation of the [s]tate constitutional right to counsel may be raised on appeal, notwithstanding that the issue was not preserved” before County Court (People v Kinchen, 60 NY2d 772, 773 [1983]). Inasmuch as defendant was not afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel “and make an informed decision as to whether to appear before the [g]rand [j]ury” (People v Sawyer, 274 AD2d 603, 606 [2000], affd 96 NY2d 815 [2001]; see People v Fields, 258 AD2d 593, 594 [1999]; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d at 705; People v Lincoln, 80 AD2d 877, 877 [1981]; compare People v Gainer, 73 AD3d 1385, 1386 [2010]), the resulting deprivation of defendant’s constitutional right to counsel requires the dismissal of the indictment (see People v Hunt, 277 AD2d at 913; People v Stevens, 151 AD2d at 704).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered October 13, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Claiming that County Court failed to take into consideration his rehabilitative needs when it sentenced him to a prison term of 4 to 12 years, defendant requests this court to modify the sentence in the interest of justice. The sentence imposed was not only authorized by law, but within the range that County Court promised at the time defendant entered his guilty plea (see, People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903). Defendant was informed by the court that, upon pleading guilty to a class B felony, he could receive a prison sentence with a maximum term of 25 years. Furthermore, another charge was dropped as a result of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances and given defendant’s criminal background, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Gray, 131 AD2d 590).

"— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Finnegan, J.), rendered February 14, 1985, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of 6 to 12 years’ imprisonment for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, to run consecutively to an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by deleting the provision that the terms of imprisonment are to run consecutively and substituting therefor a provision that the terms of imprisonment shall run concurrently to each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the vehicle in which he was a passenger was lawfully stopped for having a broken headlight, a violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 375 (2) (a) (1) (see, People v Ingle, 36 NY2d 413; People v Barnes, 144 AD2d 371; People v Meyers, 139 AD2d 601). Thus, the weapon and bag of cocaine thereafter found in plain view on the floor of the vehicle were properly ruled admissible at trial. We find nothing in the record to warrant disturbing the hearing court’s finding that the arresting police officer was a credible witness (see, People v Prochilo, 41 NY2d 759; People v Africk, 107 AD2d 700).
We find that the sentence was excessive to the extent indicated. The defendant’s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se supplemental brief, are without merit. Bracken, J.

"In satisfaction of two indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of three years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Appellate counsel for defendant requests that he be relieved of his assignment on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be advanced on appeal. Having reviewed the record, however, we are instead required to vacate the unauthorized sentence imposed. Specifically, defendant, who is not a predicate felon, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony (see Penal Law § 220.39 [1]), and a determinate sentence of three years was thereafter imposed pursuant to Penal Law § 70.70 (2) (a) (i). As a result, the permissible period of postrelease supervision could not be “less than one year nor more than two years” (Penal Law § 70.45 [2] [b]) and, therefore, the three-year period imposed herein is illegal (see e.g. People v Therrien, 78 AD3d 1331, 1331-1332 [2010]).
While this issue was not raised before County Court or on appeal, we nevertheless must vacate the illegal sentence and remit the matter “for resentencing with the opportunity for both parties to withdraw from the plea agreement” (People v Warren, 74 AD3d 1639, 1640 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Given this disposition, appellate counsel’s motion to withdraw is academic.

"Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree as charged in a superior court information. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to time served on one of the counts and five years of probation on the other. County Court, however, warned defendant that if he was arrested between the time of the plea and sentencing, it would not be bound by the agreement and could sentence him to up to four years on each count, to run consecutively. Defendant was arrested for petit larceny prior to sentencing and admitted that there was a reasonable basis for his arrest at a subsequent hearing. Consequently, County Court sentenced him to consecutive terms of imprisonment of three years on each count, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant urges this Court to modify his sentence in the interest of justice. We decline to do so in view of the circumstances. It is undisputed that defendant failed to comply with the terms of the plea agreement by getting arrested for petit larceny prior to sentencing. County Court conducted an appropriate inquiry and determined that there was a reasonable basis for defendant’s arrest (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Jenkins, 40 AD3d 1308 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 991 [2007]; compare People v Davis, 62 AD3d 1266, 1267 [2009]). Consequently, County Court was not obligated to adhere to the original sentence. Contrary to defendant’s claim, the record discloses that County Court based the new sentence on defendant’s postplea arrest, not his misdeeds while a confidential informant. In view of defendant’s considerable criminal record and status as a second felony offender, we find no extraordi nary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see generally People v Rose, 79 AD3d 1365, 1367 [2010]; People v Dilone, 261 AD2d 650 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 969 [1999]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 13, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment as well as other pending charges, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. In accord with the negotiated plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 6 Vs years in prison, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing that the appeal waiver was not valid and his sentence is harsh and excessive.
We affirm, finding that defendant knowingly waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. The record reveals that defendant executed a written waiver of his right to appeal in open court after he was properly advised regarding the separate nature of the appeal rights he was waiving and the consequences of doing so (see People v Cullen, 101 AD3d 1391, 1391 [2012]; People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered July 7, 2010, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in connection with two sales of prescription drugs to a confidential informant and an undercover member of a drug task force unit conducting the drug-buy operation. County Court sentenced defendant to two consecutive prison terms of six years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, the People established a proper foundation for the admission of tape-recorded conversations between the confidential informant and defendant. “Admissibility of tape-recorded conversation requires proof of the accuracy or authenticity of the tape by ‘clear and convincing evidence’ establishing ‘that the offered evidence is genuine and that there has been no tampering with it’ ” (People v Ely, 68 NY2d 520, 527 [1986], quoting People v McGee, 49 NY2d 48, 59 [1979], cert denied sub nom. Waters v New York, 446 US 942 [1980]; see People v Ebron, 90 AD3d 1243, 1245 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 863 [2012]; People v Tillman, 57 AD3d 1021, 1024 [2008]). “Among other methods, admissibility may be demonstrated by the testimony of a witness to the conversation or to its recording, or by evidence identifying the speakers and establishing the chain of custody of the recording and its unchanged condition” (People v Rendon, 273 AD2d 616, 618 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 968 [2000]; see People v Ely, 68 NY2d at 527-528).
Here, the foundation for the admission of the tape-recorded conversations was made through the testimony of various detectives overseeing the undercover operation who described the events surrounding the creation of the recordings, identified the voices of the informant and defendant, and set forth a chain of custody of the recordings. The testimony established that the detective operating the recording device immediately reviewed the recordings at the conclusion of the conversations and thereafter secured the recordings in police custody. Just prior to trial, the detective reviewed the tapes again and attested that they were “fair and accurate representations” of the recordings previously made by him. In addition, a second detective testified to knowing defendant for 35 years and identified one voice on the recordings as that of defendant. Hence, the People offered sufficient proof of the accuracy and authenticity of the recordings to establish a legal foundation for their admission into evidence. Any challenge by defendant relating to the reliability of the identification of his voice or inaudibility of the recording goes to the weight of the evidence, not the admissibility (see People v McGee, 49 NY2d at 60).
Next, we find unavailing defendant’s contention that the presentence report was inadequate because it did not include an updated interview with defendant. “[T]here is no statutory requirement that a statement by the defendant be included in the presentence report” (People v Davila, 238 AD2d 625, 626 [1997]; see CPL 390.30; People v Perea, 27 AD3d 960, 961 [2006]), but the presentence investigation report here in fact contains a statement by defendant regarding the instant offenses. Moreover, defendant declined the opportunity to address County Court at sentencing regarding any inadequacies contained in the report (see People v Ramirez, 90 AD3d 1335, 1336 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 961 [2012]).
Finally, defendant’s sentence was not harsh or excessive. Considering defendant’s extensive criminal history and the quantity of drugs involved in the instant matter, we discern no abuse of discretion by County Court or any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Carter, 97 AD3d 852, 852 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1024 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered December 4, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a 14-count indictment with various crimes relating to, among other things, the sale and possession of cocaine and heroin. In satisfaction of the indictment, he pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to 12 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision on the sale count and a consecutive term of 6V2 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on the possession count. Defendant appeals.
Although defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his waiver of the right to appeal, that claim is not preserved for our review because the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Bonville, 104 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2013]). While a guilty plea does not forfeit review of the denial of a suppression motion (see CPL 710.70 [2]; People v Issac, 107 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2013]), such review is foreclosed by defendant’s valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094-1095 [2013]). The valid appeal waiver also precludes defendant’s argument that the sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; People v Schanz, 82 AD3d 1417, 1417 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 800 [2011]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered July 6, 2012, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after he sold crack cocaine to an undercover police investigator twice on the same day. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 15 years. Defendant now appeals.
We reject defendant’s contention that the judgment of conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. A claimed violation of the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel will not survive judicial scrutiny “ ‘[s]o long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation’ ” (People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998], quoting People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; see People v Wiltshire, 96 AD3d 1227, 1229 [2012], lv denied 22 NY3d 1204 [2014]). In particular, after defendant’s counsel failed to ask the investigator during cross-examination if he performed field testing on the substances that he purchased from defendant, County Court denied defendant’s subsequent request to admit the investigator’s purportedly inconsistent grand jury testimony due to counsel’s failure to lay a foundational basis. In particular, during his trial testimony, the investigator explained how he processed the drugs after he purchased them from defendant, but made no specific mention of field testing the substances. The investigator’s testimony, however, was not inconsistent with his prior grand jury testimony, during which he allegedly stated that he had field tested the drugs that defendant had sold to him and, therefore, there was no testimony that could be used for impeachment purposes. Moreover, although counsel’s failure to pursue the issue of field testing while questioning the investigator was not a tactical decision, we do not agree that one isolated misstep of this nature was so “egregious and prejudicial as to compromise . . . defendant’s right to a fair trial” (People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]; accord People v Ford, 110 AD3d 1368, 1370 [2013], lv denied 24 NY3d 1043 [2014]).
As to defendant’s assertion that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive, County Court sentenced defend ant to serve two concurrent prison terms of 12 years for the criminal possession and criminal sale convictions stemming from the first of two drug sales, which were set to run consecutively with the two concurrent prison terms of three years for the criminal sale and criminal possession convictions resulting from the second drug sale. Defendant argues that, because both drug sales involved small quantities of drugs and occurred within a short period of time, the court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences. We disagree. While the drug sales occurred in a somewhat “close temporal proximity,” they were separate criminal transactions (People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]; see People v Brown, 80 NY2d 361, 363-364 [1992]). Therefore, given the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion, we decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to modify defendant’s sentences (compare People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888, 890-891 [2005]; People v Holmes, 304 AD2d 1043, 1045 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 642 [2003]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered February 5, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in a superior court information. He also executed a written waiver of the right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to an indeterminate term of 4 to 12 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant initially contends that his guilty plea was not voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently entered because the allocution was factually deficient. Inasmuch as defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, he has failed to preserve this claim for our review (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814, lv denied 98 NY2d 772; People v McWhite, 295 AD2d 757). We find the exception to the preservation rule inapplicable here inasmuch as the plea colloquy does not reveal that defendant’s factual recitation casts significant doubt on his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635). In any event, were we to review defendant’s claim, we would find it to be without merit. “[D]efendant’s affirmative responses to County Court’s questions established the elements of the crime [ ] charged and there is no indication in the record that the voluntary plea was baseless or improvident” (People v Kemp, supra at 636; see People v Bunger, 269 AD2d 620, lv denied 94 NY2d 945).
Moreover, defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is not premised upon the alleged involuntariness of the plea, does not survive defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Porter, 300 AD2d 698; People v Almonte, 288 AD2d 632, lv denied 97 NY2d 726). Even if it did, defendant’s failure to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes him from raising it (see People v Smith, 300 AD2d 745; People v King, 299 AD2d 661). Nevertheless, were we to review this claim, we would also find it unpersuasive. The record does not substantiate defendant’s assertion that his counsel did not adequately investigate potential defenses. Viewing the totality of the circumstances, we find that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807).
Lastly, defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence is also encompassed by his voluntary waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 702; People v Teague, supra at 815). Even if it was not, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lopez, supra).

Defendant contends on this appeal that his sentence of 2 to 6 years’ imprisonment is harsh and excessive. Defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. The sentence received is less than the harshest possible sentence and was consistent with the plea bargain. Given these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered December 9, 2013, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant was indicted and charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant thereafter entered an Alford plea to one count of each crime, allocuted to the remaining two charges and waived her right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant within the parameters of the plea agreement to an aggregate prison term of three years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to be served concurrently with a recently imposed sentence. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, to the extent that it survives her appeal waiver, is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that she made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 119 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1089 [2014]).

Upon reviewing the record and brief submitted by defense counsel on the direct appeal from his judgment of conviction, we agree that there are no nonfrivolous issues that could be raised on appeal. Consequently, the judgment should be af firmed and defense counsel’s application for leave to withdraw granted (see, Anders v California, 386 US 738; People v Creeden, 150 AD2d 887).
Defendant contends that County Court erred in denying his CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. On this appeal, defendant argues that his attorney was ineffective in failing to argue that defendant’s Alzheimer’s disease rendered his guilty plea ineffectual. We disagree and affirm. Defendant’s conClusory allegations that he was not totally aware of the proceedings he was involved in are belied by an examination of the record. County Court engaged defendant in a full colloquy at the time of the plea, during which defendant stated that he had no mental disability. At sentencing, defendant stated that his condition did not affect his plea. Further, nothing in the record indicates that defendant’s condition affected his understanding of the plea proceedings. County Court therefore properly denied defendant’s motion without conducting a hearing (see, CPL 440.30 [4]; People v St. John, 163 AD2d 687, lv denied 76 NY2d 944).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Lamont, J.), rendered November 17, 1989, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that the sentence she received upon her plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was harsh or excessive. Initially, we note that the prison sentence imposed of three years to life was the most lenient sentence authorized (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a]; People v Pardoe, 147 AD2d 820). Furthermore, in exchange for her plea another pending charge was dropped and the sentence she received was in accordance with the plea-bargain agreement.

"— Petition in an original proceeding in this Court pursuant to CPLR article 78 for relief in the nature of prohibition, seeking vacatur of the guilty plea accepted on August 10, 1992 by respondent, as the Justice presiding at Part 69 of the Criminal Term of Supreme Court, New York County, in the underlying criminal prosecution on New York County Indictment No. 14448/91 (People v Nathaniel Johnson), is unanimously granted, on the law, without costs, the plea is vacated, and the indictment is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.
The indictment charged Johnson (""defendant”) with one count of Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance in the Third Degree to an undercover officer. On about ten separate occa sions defendant had appeared with counsel at a calendar part of Criminal Term before the case was assigned for trial before respondent on July 29, 1992. On that date defendant offered, through counsel, to plead guilty to an attempted sale in the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictment,, in return for a promised sentence of five years probation. Throughout an intensive colloquy, defendant refused to admit his guilt of the offense charged, insisting on his right to enter what amounted to an Alford plea (North Carolina v Alford, 400 US 25), whereby a defendant may be permitted to deny guilt but nonetheless plead guilty to avoid the risks perceived in going to trial. On behalf of the People, the Assistant District Attorney then withdrew her consent to the proposed plea bargain without an admission of guilt, and announced the People’s readiness for trial. Despite the absence of prosecutorial consent, and even explicit objection, respondent accepted the plea and set a sentencing date. The People now seek relief in this Court.
When the People do not consent, a court is without power or jurisdiction to accept a defendant’s plea to less than the full indictment (People ex rel. Leventhal v Warden, 102 AD2d 317; see, CPL 220.10 [3]). And where, as here, a court acts beyond its jurisdiction, prohibition will lie to redress this type of error (Matter of Cosgrove v La Mendola, 73 AD2d 810).
Matter of Gribetz v Edelstein (66 AD2d 788) is illustrative. In that case a defendant wished to plead to the charge of burglary in the third degree, and his co-defendant refused. The People took the position that unless both pleaded, the offer would be withdrawn and consent withheld. Despite this, the court accepted the defendant’s plea. In granting prohibition and vacating the plea, the Second Department noted: ""A District Attorney may dictate the terms under which he will agree to consent to accept a guilty plea and where his terms are not met, he may withhold such consent; the withholding of such consent by statutory mandate renders the court without authority to accept a plea to anything less than the entire indictment [citations omitted].” (Supra.)
Here, the People had the power and right to ""dictate” the terms and conditions of the plea, and one of those conditions, advanced early in the plea negotiations, was an allocution containing an admission of guilt. Criminal Term had no power to sweep that condition aside. Concur—Sullivan, J. P., Milonas, Wallach, Ross and Asch, JJ.",,543,"Robert Morgenthau, Petitioner, v.

Appeal from two judgments of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered November 21, 1997, convicting defendants upon their pleas of guilty of the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.
Defendants were principals of Recovery Counseling Associates, Inc., a corporation which provided outpatient alcohol rehabilitation services to various clients including some recipients of Medicaid. Following an investigation which revealed that fraudulent claims had been filed by the corporation for Medicaid reimbursement, defendants pleaded guilty to the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree as charged in a superior court information. On November 21, 1997, County Court sentenced defendants to 1 to 3 years in prison. In addition, defendants were ordered, along with other codefendants, to pay restitution in the amount of $76,608. On appeal, defendants argue that the sentences imposed by County Court are harsh and excessive.
We affirm. We acknowledge that there are considerations which support more lenient sentences herein, such as the valuable services provided by defendants to the community as evidenced by the numerous letters written on their behalf, defendants’ expressions of remorse for their actions and the recommendations contained in the presentence reports. Nevertheless, inasmuch as County Court considered appropriate factors in imposing sentence, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion nor do we find that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a reduction (see generally, People v Hearn, 248 AD2d 889; see, People v Torres, 237 AD2d 650, 652; People v Scotti, 232 AD2d 775, 777, lv denied 89 NY2d 946).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 3, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty in February 2003 to a reduced count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. The charge against defendant stemmed from the sale of crack cocaine to a confidential informant in Washington Park in the City of Albany in August 2002. Thereafter, defendant, a second felony offender, was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to, among other things, a term of imprisonment of lxk to 1472 years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, in light of County Court’s failure to adequately distinguish the right to appeal from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty, defendant’s oral waiver of his right to appeal was invalid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006] ; People v Lewis, 39 AD3d 1025, 1025 [2007]; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 923 [2007] ; People v Cain, 29 AD3d 1157, 1157 [2006]). Accordingly, we will address all issues raised by defendant on appeal, not only those which survive a valid waiver.
Defendant’s first contention is that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made. Notably, while defendant asserts that this issue was properly preserved for our review by means of a previous motion to vacate the judgment of conviction, the purported motion is not contained in the record nor is any decision from County Court on the matter, thus defeating the purpose of the preservation requirement. In any event, were defendant’s claim properly before us, we would find it lacking in merit. Upon review of the proceedings resulting in the conviction of defendant upon his plea, we find that defendant’s unequivocal affirmative responses to County Court’s factual recitation of his crime to be sufficient and he was adequately apprised of and understood his rights and the ramifications of his plea (see People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007]; People v Lewis, 39 AD3d at 1026; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d at 1076). To the extent that defendant’s claim relates to his counsel’s representation, the grounds advanced largely relate to his sentencing and, consequently, did not impact the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]).
Next, defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. However, upon review of the record—including his sworn statement during his plea colloquy that he was satisfied with counsel’s representation—we find nothing that casts doubt upon the effectiveness of defendant’s retained counsel (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]). We are unpersuaded by defendant’s assertion that counsel’s failure to move to withdraw his plea on the basis of his claims of innocence and an alibi contained in the presentence investigation report rendered her representation less than meaningful, particularly considering defendant’s failure to protest when afforded an opportunity to address County Court prior to pronouncement of his sentence. In sum, we are satisfied that defendant received meaningful representation, especially in light of the favorable plea bargain negotiated by counsel which resulted in defendant pleading to a lower level felony, a negotiated sentence that was less than the maximum permitted and the fact that his plea served to satisfy other uncharged crimes (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024-1025 [2007]; People v Williams, 35 AD3d at 973; People v Cain, 29 AD3d at 1158).
Finally, we have reviewed defendant’s claim that his bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive and find it to be unavailing (see People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d at 1076; People v Cain, 29 AD3d at 1157-1158).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered November 15, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, waiving his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison term of two years, with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by the voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Alexander, 31 AD3d 885, 886 [2006]; People v Feller, 25 AD3d 881 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]). In addition, his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders the issue as to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Bennett, 30 AD3d 631, 631 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 809 [2006]; People v Jones, 30 AD3d 633, 633 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]) and the exception to the preservation rule is not applicable inasmuch as defendant made no statements inconsistent with his guilt (see People v Campbell, 29 AD3d 1083, 1083-1084 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 786 [2006]; People v Evans, 27 AD3d 905, 906-907 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 847 [2006]). In any event, defendant’s responses to County Court’s questions during the plea colloquy established the elements of the crime and it was not necessary for defendant to personally recite the underlying facts (see People v Alexander, supra; People v Mahar, 12 AD3d 715, 716 [2004]).
We also find that, although defendant has some mental health difficulties for which he is receiving medication, the record as a whole reflects that he has demonstrated an ability to manage his mental health symptoms and he was capable of understanding the proceedings against him. As such, a competency hearing, which defense counsel did not request, was not required (see People v Ferrer, 16 AD3d 913, 914 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]; People v Kane, 6 AD3d 876, 877 [2004]). Finally, defendant’s claim that his sentence should be modified in the interest of justice is foreclosed given his valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Alexander, supra at 886).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered June 9, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal mischief in the fourth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal mischief in the fourth degree as a result of his conduct in leaving a gasoline station pump nozzle locked in the “on” position on the ground overnight, causing quantities of fuel to empty into a nearby body of water when the station turned its pumps on in the morning. During the course of the plea allocution, defendant waived his right to appeal everything but the sentence. With respect to the plea bargain, the prosecutor indicated that, regarding sentence, the agreement included no incarceration and a fixed amount of restitution, “but allowing the court other options including fines * * * community service, restitution, probation, and the waiver of appeal of everything other than sentence”. The sole commitment from County Court was its agreement not to impose any sentence of incarceration. At sentencing, County Court imposed, inter alia, the agreed-upon restitution as well as 800 hours of community service. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the community service portion of the sentence imposed by County Court.
Upon review of the record, we conclude, and the People concede, that the record does not support a finding that County Court complied with the requirements of Penal Law § 65.10 with respect to the imposition of community service. Notably, Penal Law § 65.10 (2) (h) permits imposition of community service for misdemeanor convictions such as this one, however, it only does so “where the defendant has consented to the amount and conditions of such service”. Thus, while there can be no question from the plea allocution that a general consent to the possibility of community service as a valid sentencing option can be inferred (cf., People v Suros, 209 AD2d 203, lv denied 85 NY2d 943, cert denied 516 US 862), there is no proof whatsoever on the record that defendant consented to the amount and conditions of the community service actually imposed by County Court, which is what is specifically required by the statute. Accordingly, the matter must be remitted to County Court for resentencing.

Defendant thereafter made pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment and/or to inspect the Grand Jury minutes. He further moved to suppress the identification testimony, and in the event that he decided not to go trial, he moved for leave to enter an Alford/ Serrano plea. All of these motions were ultimately denied by County Court. Defendant then agreed to a plea bargain pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to all three counts of the indictment in exchange for a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. Defendant appeals from the subsequent judgment of conviction.
Defendant contends that County Court erred by denying his pretrial motions. First, he argues that the pretrial identification procedures involved in having the police witnesses identify defendant from a photo array was unduly suggestive. Our review of the record herein, including the transcript of the Wade hearing, discloses that the photo array identification was not so suggestive as to violate defendant’s due process rights. Although defendant points to various aspects in the testimony of the identifying police officers which he finds inconsistent, such alleged inconsistencies raise issues of credibility that are best resolved by the hearing court (see, People v Cotroneo, 199 AD2d 670, lv denied 83 NY2d 851). Its findings will not be disturbed when, as in the instant matter, they are fully supported by the record (see, People v Mena-Coss, 210 AD2d 745, 746, lv denied 86 NY2d 798; People v Arias, 209 AD2d 862, 863, lv denied 85 NY2d 859).
County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment and/or to inspect the Grand Jury minutes was also appropriate. The court properly determined that the Grand Jury minutes were legally sufficient to support the charges filed against defendant and that defendant had failed to establish a right to inspect them (see, People v Miller, 210 AD2d 724, 726).
Finally, we decline to disturb County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to file an Alford! Serrano plea. Given the absence of any compelling evidence that defendant was not guilty as charged, such a plea would have been inappropriate (see, People v White, 214 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 86 NY2d 742).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J), rendered March 27, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Following his arrest in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County, defendant was charged in a superior court information with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crime charged and subsequently was sentenced, as a predicate felon, to the agreed-upon prison term of 3½ to 7 years. Defendant now appeals, contending that his plea was involuntary and his sentence is harsh and excessive.
We affirm. By failing to make the appropriate motion before County Court (see CPL 220.60 [3]; 440.10), defendant has neglected to preserve for our review any issues concerning the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Moore, 8 AD3d 750 [2004]; People v Leabo, 2 AD3d 1213, 1213 [2003]). Regardless, our review of the minutes of the plea colloquy persuades us that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Defendant affirmatively admitted to committing acts constituting the charged crime (see People v Rivera, 266 AD2d 576, 577 [1999]; People v Partridge, 242 AD2d 788, 789 [1997]) and expressed a cogent understanding of the rights he was relinquishing by operation of his plea. Finally, defendant’s challenge to the severity of his bargained-for sentence has been waived by execution of his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Bishop, 8 AD3d 691 [2004] ; People v Wagoner, 6 AD3d 985, 986 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Sheridan, J.), rendered October 21, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of SVs to IOV2 years. Inasmuch as the record reflects that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal as part of his guilty plea, his challenge to the harshness of the sentence imposed has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Cuevas [Carlito] [Manny], 234 AD2d 804, lvs denied 89 NY2d 940, 941, 944). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s assertion, we would find that the sentence imposed, which was in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement and within the statutory parameters, was neither harsh nor excessive (see, People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893; People v Walters, 216 AD2d 611).

"Garry, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered August 17, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged by superior court information with one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and he thereafter pleaded guilty to that charge and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was subsequently sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of eight years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find his appeal waiver to be valid. County Court did not lump the right to appeal with the panoply of rights usually forfeited by a guilty plea, and defendant agreed that he understood the “separate and distinct nature” of the right to appeal. Moreover, defendant confirmed on the record that he understood the written appeal waiver that he had executed in open court, which explained that “the waiver of [defendant’s] appellate rights is separate and distinct from those rights . . . automatically forfeited upon [his] plea of guilty.” The written waiver adequately detailed the scope of the appellate rights that defendant was waiving and recited that defendant had discussed the waiver of those rights with counsel. Accordingly, we find defendant’s combined oral and written waiver to be knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Belile, 137 AD3d 1460, 1461 [2016]; People v McKenzie, 136 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]; People v Devault, 124 AD3d 1140, 1140 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 989 [2015]). Defendant’s contention that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive is barred by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1333 [2016], lv denied 29 NY3d 1001 [2017]).
Defendant’s claim that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender survives his valid appeal waiver (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]). However, defendant failed to object to being sentenced as a second felony offender despite having the opportunity to do so, and the issue is therefore unpreserved (see People v Caldwell, 80 AD3d 998, 999 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 857 [2011]; People v Glynn, 72 AD3d at 1352). In any event, were this issue properly before us, we would find, upon reviewing the record, that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Hummel, 127 AD3d 1506, 1507 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1202 [2015]; compare People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 19, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that a sentence of IV2 to 4V2 years in prison would be imposed. Defendant later requested that a scheduled sentencing date of March 6, 1997 be adjourned until March 31, 1997, with defen dant released on his own recognizance. County Court agreed to the adjournment but conditioned such release on defendant, inter alia, appearing for sentencing on the rescheduled date. The court warned defendant that a violation of any of these agreed-upon conditions would result in an increase of defendant’s sentence up to the harshest available sentence of 8 Vs to 25 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant did not appear for sentencing and, when he was returned to court on a warrant over a year later, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 6 to 18 years. This appeal followed.
We affirm. Although defendant concedes that County Court was within its authority in imposing an enhanced sentence under the circumstances (see, e.g., People v Hughes, 260 AD2d 657; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880), he nevertheless maintains that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, a contention we cannot endorse. It is well settled that “a sentence within permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification” (People v Woodard, 263 AD2d 682). Given defendant’s awareness of the consequences for violating the release conditions and his criminal history, we find no basis to reduce his sentence in the interest of justice.

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered November 20, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and assault in the first degree.
Defendant was charged with various crimes relating to his possession of cocaine in December 1999 and with assault in the first degree after a shooting incident in June 2000. Thereafter, he agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and assault in the first degree in full satisfaction of all charges. As part of the plea agreement, he was to receive a sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison on the criminal possession charge and a determinate 10-year prison term on the assault charge, to run consecutively. At the time of his plea, defendant executed a written waiver of the right to appeal. During the plea proceedings, County Court advised defendant that he would have to acknowledge his waiver at sentencing. Prior to sentencing, however, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and disavowed his waiver of the right to appeal. County Court denied the motion without a hearing. At sentencing, defendant refused to reaffirm his waiver of the right to appeal. As a result, County Court did not abide by the original sentencing promise with respect to the assault charge and imposed a determinate 15-year prison term instead. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we find no error in the denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing. “It is well settled that ‘[t]he decision to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea is a matter within the trial court’s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to its voluntariness’ ” (People v Bagley, 298 AD2d 616, 616 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 580 [2003], quoting People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664 [2002]; see People v Babcock, 304 AD2d 912 [2003]). As grounds supporting his motion, defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective and that he is innocent of the charges. Our review of the record, however, does not reveal that defendant protested his innocence during any stage of the proceedings. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that his attorney did not competently represent him or that he was coerced into entering the plea. Rather, after being fully informed of the consequences of pleading guilty and the rights he was waiving thereby, defendant related that he had conferred with counsel and understood them. He proceeded to admit the elements of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. Insofar as defendant has advanced nothing but conclusory assertions, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion without a hearing (see People v Kagonyera, 304 AD2d 984, 985 [2003]; People v Robinson, 301 AD2d 745, 746 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]).
We reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to County Court’s imposition of an enhanced sentence on the assault charge based upon defendant’s failure to reaffirm his waiver of the right to appeal at sentencing. Although County Court informed defendant during the plea proceedings that his acknowledgment and waiver of the right to appeal was part of the plea bargain, it did not specifically instruct him that reaffirming such waiver was a condition of the plea bargain itself and that his failure to do so would result in a greater sentence. Consequently, we conclude that defendant could not be subjected to an enhanced sentence under these circumstances (see People v Pham, 287 AD2d 789, 790 [2001]; cf. People v Paige, 266 AD2d 587, 588 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 827 [1999]; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, 854 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 880 [1999]). Inasmuch as the People concede this and consent to the imposition of the sentence negotiated as part of the plea agreement, we find that this is the appropriate remedy (see People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63, 69 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 967 [2000]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Cawley, J.), rendered March 4, 2009, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of the crimes of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
On October 2, 2006, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment in exchange for a bargained-for sentence of two years with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was administered Parker warnings and released from custody. When he failed to appear for sentencing, an arrest warrant was issued.
In the fall of 2007, defendant was involved in further criminal activity resulting in an April 2008 indictment for numerous drug-related offenses. As a result of further negotiations, on March 4, 2009, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and agreed to be sentenced as a second felony drug offender to an aggregate prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of five years. County Court sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon sentences on both convictions and ran the sentences concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved from his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that no nonfrivolous issues exist that could be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record, however, we are required to vacate the unauthorized sentence imposed on defendant’s plea to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. Defendant pleaded guilty to a class A-I felony (see Penal Law § 110.05 [1]; § 220.21) and, as a second felony drug offender, was subject to a minimum term of imprisonment of 12 years (see Penal Law § 70.71 [3] [b] [i]; People v Cameron, 83 NY2d 838, 840 [1994]). While this issue was not raised by either party before the sentencing court or on appeal and the sentence as imposed favors defendant, we nevertheless must vacate the illegal sentence (see People v Warner, 69 AD3d 1052, 1054 [2010]; People v Davis, 37 AD3d 1179, 1180 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 983 [2007]). Accordingly, the sentence is vacated and the case is “remitted for resentencing with the opportunity for both parties to withdraw from the plea agreement” (People v Cameron, 83 NY2d at 840). In light of this disposition, appellate counsel’s motion to withdraw is academic.

"—Spain, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 25, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and, as part of the agreement, was sentenced to a prison term of six years to life. Consistent with the agreement, a second criminal indictment (which had been consolidated with the first), charging him with possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and resisting arrest, was dismissed. Defendant appeals, contending that his sentence must be vacated because it resulted from a plea agreement which was made at a time when both sides and County Court were laboring under the misapprehension that defendant was already an adjudicated felon, thereby rendering him subject to the enhanced sentencing guidelines applicable to second felony offenders for whom the agreed-upon sentence of six years to life was, by statute, the minimum prison term (see Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [a]).
At the outset, it is conceded that the presentence report, prepared during the interim between the plea and sentencing hearings, does not include any information to support the conclusion that defendant had ever before been convicted of a felony, but disclosed only that he had two prior misdemeanor convictions and a youthful offender adjudication. However, at the plea allocution, defense counsel demonstrated his misapprehension of defendant’s status as a second felony offender by stating that under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant would be sentenced to a prison term of six years to life, which he characterized as representing “the minimum [permissible sentence for] * * * a second felony offender.” County Court appears to have been similarly misinformed, in that it explained to defendant that by pleading guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, he would receive a prison sentence representing “the minimum for a two felony offender that being a minimum of six years and a maximum of your natural life.”
At the sentencing hearing, no additional statements were made by the prosecution, defense counsel or County Court indicating that defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender. He was then sentenced to the previously agreed-upon prison term of six years to life, a sentence which was the minimum for a second felony offender, but which was also within the permissible statutory limits for a first-time felony offender such as defendant (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]). Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, but appealed from the judgment, challenging only his sentence.
On appeal, defendant makes no argument to undermine his conviction, but he seeks a reduction in his sentence from this Court or, in the alternative, remittal to County Court for resentencing. As previously noted, the sentence was within the permissible statutory limits for a first-time felon and defendant was not erroneously adjudicated a second felony offender, having been sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement. Accordingly, the sentence was not per se illegal and, as such, defendant was required to timely register an objection to the sentence before County Court to preserve the issue for appellate review (see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52, 56-57). Defendant failed to make the requisite objection.
Troubled by the universal misunderstanding apparent from the record that defendant was a second felony offender and, thus, would necessarily face a minimum possible sentence of six years — the statutory minimum for a second felony offender under Penal Law § 70.06 (4) (a) — for the crime to which he pleaded guilty, we exercise our jurisdiction as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [3] [c]). In fact, pursuant to Penal Law § 70.00 (3) (a) (ii), defendant, as a first-time felon, would have faced a three-year minimum sentence upon his conviction of this class A-II felony. As we are unable to ascertain from the record whether County Court would have imposed the same sentence had it been apprised of defendant’s actual status or whether, as defendant contends, the court intended to sentence defendant to the minimum permissible sentence, we remit to permit County Court to exercise its discretion for resentencing or any other action deemed appropriate (see People v Predmore, 142 AD2d 759, 759-760; cf. People v Housman, 291 AD2d 665, 666, lv denied 98 NY2d 638; People v Febos, 122 AD2d 497, 498, lv denied 68 NY2d 812).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered August 3, 2009, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment. During the plea proceeding, the People informed County Court that, pursuant to the negotiated agreement, it recommended concurrent sentences of 4V2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision on both counts. At sentencing, the People recommended concurrent sentences of 4V2 years in prison and three years of post-release supervision. Thereafter, County Court proceeded to sentence defendant, as a second felony offender, to two concurrent sentences of 44/2 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that her plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered because she was informed at the time of her plea that she would be sentenced to two years of postrelease supervision. Although the terms of postrelease supervision imposed by County Court differed from the terms stated at the plea proceeding, defendant’s claim that her plea was involuntary on that basis is unpreserved for our review due to her failure to bring it to County Court’s attention, either when she was made aware of the terms at the outset of the sentencing proceeding (see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Lee, 80 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 832 [2011]) or when the sentence was imposed (see People v Davis, 79 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 797 [2011]).

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison term of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant appeals, contending that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
“In the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [citations omitted]).

Furthermore, the agreed-upon sentence, which was less than the maximum, substantially reduced defendant’s exposure to a more lengthy prison term if convicted after a trial. Although defendant maintains that defense counsel permitted him to make incriminating statements to County Court prior to entering into the plea, he has failed to demonstrate how he suffered any prejudice as a result of such statements (see People v Gifford, 285 AD2d 669). We find that, viewed in totality as of the time of the representation, defendant received meaningful representation (see People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806) and he failed to “ ‘show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial’ ” (People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 18, quoting Hill v Lockhart, 474 US 52, 59).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered February 4, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced, in accord with the terms of the plea agreement, to five years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we note that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal was valid. County Court explained that this right was separate from the other rights that defendant was forfeiting by pleading guilty and defendant communicated his understanding. He then proceeded to execute a detailed written waiver in open court after reviewing it with counsel. Thus, defendant is foreclosed by his valid waiver from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Miller, 137 AD3d 1485, 1485 [2016]; People v Rushlow, 137 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2016]).
Defendant also challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Although it is not precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal, this claim has not been preserved for our review, as the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Blair, 136 AD3d 1105, 1106 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1066 [2016]; People v Walker, 135 AD3d 1244, 1244-1245 [2016]). Notably, defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt and thus trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Walker, 135 AD3d at 1245). Further, defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, although it also survives his appeal waiver, likewise has not been preserved for our review, for the reason noted above (see People v Hughes, 134 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 966 [2016]; People v Bethea, 133 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 992 [2016]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging her with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, as well as criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and, in accordance with the plea agreement, she was sentenced to five years of probation, but was later charged with violating its terms. Defendant admitted to using marihuana and cocaine and failing to report, both in violation of the terms and conditions of her underlying probation. In exchange, she was to be sentenced on the underlying crimes to concurrent prison terms of 2V2 years, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. County Court revoked her probation and resentenced her accordingly. She now appeals from the judgment of conviction and the judgment of resentencing.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the term of imprisonment imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. We disagree. She admittedly continued engaging in drug use and failing to report while on probation, which resulted in its revocation. Moreover, the prison term imposed by County Court was within the parameters specifically agreed to by defendant. Inasmuch as there are no extraordinary circumstances nor an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the resentence in the interest of justice, we decline to disturb it (see People v Harrison, 93 AD3d 995, 995 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 961 [2012]; People v Cherry, 263 AD2d 683, 683 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1016 [1999]).

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that his sentence of 1% to 5 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. Defendant’s plea to a reduced charge of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree was taken in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment. The sentence was consistent with the plea bargain and less than the harshest possible sentence. In light of these facts, and considering defendant’s prior criminal record, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered July 21, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
We reject the contention that defendant’s plea of guilty should be vacated because it was not knowingly and voluntarily entered and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of conviction. On the day scheduled for trial, with a panel of prospective jurors present and ready for jury selection, defendant entered a counseled plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally possessing a hypodermic instrument. Pursuant to North Carolina v Alford (400 US 25) and People v Serrano (15 NY2d 304), in order to avoid the risk of conviction after trial and the greater sentence that could be expected as a result, defendant entered the plea despite his protestation of innocence and with the express understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 6 years, the sentence actually imposed.
We are not persuaded that defendant’s statements of dissatisfaction with his assigned counsel, apparently the third to represent him, or the People’s assertion that, with time served, defendant was already eligible for parole rendered the plea involuntary or unknowing. Although the People agreed that they would not oppose parole, no representation was made that defendant would be immediately released. In fact, County Court specifically instructed defendant that his eligibility for parole did not necessarily mean that the Parole Board would release him. Finally, County Court was not required to accede to defendant’s last-minute insistence that he would proceed to trial only with assigned counsel from outside Sullivan County (see, People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, 841, lv denied 79 NY2d 949; People v Bray, 170 AD2d 722, 723).

"Main, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Scheinman, J.), rendered March 2, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends that his judgment of conviction should be reversed and the indictment against him dismissed because the actual currency that passed from a police informant to defendant in exchange for a quantity of cocaine was not preserved for trial. This argument lacks merit. We note first that a defendant can be found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance even where no money has been given to him in exchange for the substance, since Penal Law § 220.00 (1) defines such a sale as including, inter alia, an exchange or gift. Thus, strictly speaking, it was not necessary for the People to introduce into evidence the money used in the transaction in order to convict defendant. Moreover, the People here did introduce into evidence photocopies of the money in question as well as testimony regarding the possession by defendant of that very currency following the transaction.
We likewise reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence imposed upon him of 4 to 12 years was harsh and excessive. The sentence was within the statutory limits and there is no evidence that the sentencing court abused its discretion (see, People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976, 977). We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be lacking in merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Ceresia, Jr., J.), rendered May 9, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts).
Defendant was sentenced on his plea of guilty to concurrent prison sentences of 8 Vs to 25 years on each of four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and 8V2 years to life for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. On this appeal, he argues that the sentence was harsh and excessive and also that the sentence for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree is illegal.
The People concede that defendant was not a predicate felon and could not be legally sentenced to more than 8 Vs years as the minimum portion of his indeterminate sentence for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. Therefore, this sentence was illegal (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). Because this sentence was concurrent with those imposed for the other convictions, we find no reason to vacate the sentence or remit the matter, and instead reduce it to a prison term of 8 Vs years to life (see, People v De Gaspard, 170 AD2d 835, 839, lv denied 77 NY2d 994; People v Roseboom, 167 AD2d 784). Further, given defendant’s criminal record and the fact that he pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentences ultimately imposed, all of which were concurrent to each other and to the undischarged portion of the sentence defendant was serving at the time, we find no reason to otherwise disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Trujillo, 175 AD2d 950, lv denied 78 NY2d 1130; People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, lv denied 75 NY2d 812).

In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of six years followed by three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending that his plea was involuntary due to alleged misrepresentations made by County Court (Bruhn, J.) regarding his period of postrelease supervision.
The case law makes clear that “a defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action” (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; see People v Brown, 77 AD3d 1053, 1054 [2010]; People v Meyers, 73 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010]). Thus, where the sentencing court fails to apprise a defendant — prior to the imposition of sentencing — of either the mandatory imposition of postrelease supervision or the “specific duration or range [there]of. . . , the voluntariness of the plea may be challenged on appeal even absent preservation of the issue by postallocution motion” (People v Lee, 80 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2011], Iv denied 16 NY3d 832 [2011]; see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Grimm, 69 AD3d 1231, 1231-1232 [2010], Iv granted 14 NY3d 888 [2010]).
Here, however, defendant does not claim that the sentencing court failed to apprise him that he would be subject to a specified period of postrelease supervision. Rather, defendant contends that his plea bargain included the minimum period of postrelease supervision allowable by statute, which he asserts is IV2 years, and, therefore, the imposition of a longer term rendered his plea involuntary. Assuming, without deciding, that such a claim presents an exception to the preservation requirement, defendant’s assertion that County Court misrepresented the term of postrelease supervision to be imposed lacks merit. The record reflects that defendant repeatedly was advised— both during the course of his plea and prior to the imposition of sentence — that he would be subject to three years of postrelease supervision. Under these circumstances, we decline to reverse in the interest of justice (see People v Lee, 80 AD3d at 1073).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered July 6, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Prior to jury selection in the trial of an indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, defendant was arraigned on a new indictment charging him with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and defense counsel was permitted to view a videotape of the drug transaction which gave rise to the second indictment. After conferring with defense counsel, and based upon the assurance that he would be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of two years and 5 to 10 years, respectively, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the weapon possession charge and one count of the drug possession charge in satisfaction of both indictments. County Court thereafter denied defendant’s motion to withdraw the plea and sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon concurrent terms. Defendant appeals.
Defendant argues that as a result of his statements during the allocution denying any knowledge that the gun was loaded, County Court erred in accepting his plea to the weapon possession charge. Assuming that defendant’s argument has been preserved for our review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662), we disagree. To support a conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree pursuant to Penal Law § 265.02 (4), it must be established that defendant knowingly possessed a loaded weapon (see, People v Ford, 66 NY2d 428, 440). Defendant admitted that he knowingly possessed a gun and that the gun was loaded, although he claims that he did not discover it was loaded until after he had given up possession of it. There is no requirement that defendant knew the weapon was loaded when he possessed it (see, People v Toribio, 216 AD2d 189, lv denied 87 NY2d 908; People v Casanas, 170 AD2d 257, lv denied 77 NY2d 959; People v Ansare, 96 AD2d 96).
With regard to defendant’s motion to withdraw the plea, the record discloses that prior to accepting the plea, County Court advised defendant of the rights he would be waiving and defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights and was acting voluntarily with no coercion. Defendant freely admitted his guilt of the two crimes and, as a result of the plea bargain, was assured of concurrent sentences that were considerably less than the harshest possible consecutive sentences that could have been imposed. In these circumstances, defendant’s conclusory claims of innocence, coercion and/or ineffective assistance of counsel, which remained unsubstantiated despite the ample opportunity afforded by County Court to defendant and his attorney on the motion, provided no basis to vacate the plea (see, People v Feliciano, 242 AD2d 787; People v Hudson, 237 AD2d 759, lv denied 90 NY2d 1012).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered October 28, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. On July 8, 1992, prior to the conclusion of a hearing to suppress physical evidence, defendant entered a counseled plea of guilty to the first count charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. The plea was conditioned upon County Court’s promise that should he appear for sentencing on August 17, 1992 and enter a plea of guilty under the second count to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony, he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to the statutory minimum of 3 to 6 years in prison and his guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree would be vacated. As a further condition of the plea, defendant also agreed to withdraw all motions previously filed.
On August 17, 1992, defendant appeared in County Court represented by new counsel who had filed a motion on defendant’s behalf to withdraw his guilty plea. The proceedings were adjourned to October 27, 1992. On October 27, 1992, County Court denied defendant’s motion to vacate and adjourned the matter to the following day to give defendant an opportunity to confer with his attorney in order to determine if he wished to proceed in accordance with the negotiated plea disposition of July 8, 1992. On October 28, 1992, in response to the court’s further inquiry as to how he wished to proceed, defendant stated that he was ""staying mute”. County Court then proceeded to sentence defendant to 4 Vi to 9 years in prison, the statutory minimum for a predicate felon convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see, Penal Law § 70.06). Defendant appeals.
Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that County Court abused its discretion by denying his application to withdraw his plea. Here, the record confirms that ""the plea was knowing and voluntary and was made without the protestation of innocence” (see, People v Collins, 186 AD2d 298; People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, 884-886, lv denied 75 NY2d 921). Furthermore, ""[a] sentencing court need not permit a defendant to withdraw a plea where, as here, the defendant himself has failed to fulfill an explicit condition underlying the sentence agreement” (People v McDaniels, 111 AD2d 876, 877; see, People v Scott, 196 AD2d 921; People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841). One of the clear and unequivocal conditions of the court’s promise to sentence defendant to 3 to 6 years was defendant’s entry of a plea to the lesser offense of attempted possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant’s failure to fulfill this condition, despite the court’s meticulous explanation of the sentencing consequences should he fail to enter a plea to the class C felony, left County Court with the discretion to impose whatever legal sentence it felt was appropriate under the circumstances (see, People v Scott, supra). As previously noted, defendant’s sentence was the minimum authorized by law.
Additionally, by agreeing to withdraw all outstanding motions and entering his guilty plea before a decision was rendered on his suppression motion, defendant forfeited appellate review of the suppression issues which he seeks to raise on this appeal (see, People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686; People v Clark, 197 AD2d 531, lv denied 82 NY2d 892).
We have considered the remaining contentions raised by defendant’s assigned counsel and by defendant’s supplementary brief and find them to be lacking in merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered October 9, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and, in so doing, expressly waived his right to appeal. Before County Court accepted the plea, however, it warned defendant that, in the event that he violated the conditions of the plea agreement, including the obligation to return to court on the sentencing date, it would not be bound by the agreed-upon prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. Defendant acknowledged that he understood the warning as explained to him. He nevertheless failed to appear for the scheduled sentencing hearing and was brought before the court in October 2003. County Court, finding that defendant had breached the terms of the plea agreement, sentenced him to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s argument that County Court erred in imposing a sentence greater than that which was contemplated by the plea agreement without allowing him the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea “falls squarely within the scope of his waiver of the right to appeal, which he failed to challenge by moving to vacate the plea or judgment” (People v Perham, 263 AD2d 766, 766 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1045 [1999] [citation omitted]; see People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 791 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 833 [2000]). In any event, defendant’s contention is unpersuasive inasmuch as he, without any valid excuse, breached the unequivocal requirement that he be present for sentencing, thereby justifying County Court’s determination to impose an enhanced sentence (see People v Perham, supra at 767).
We similarly conclude that defendant’s challenge to his sentence on the ground that it is harsh and excessive is not properly before us in light of his knowing waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Schryver, 306 AD2d 626, 626-627 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 598 [2003]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800 [2001]). Nevertheless, even if we were to consider this issue, there is no record evidence demonstrating an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court or the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence here (see People v Calkins, 6 AD3d 744, 746 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 671 [2004]).
We have reviewed defendant’s remaining contentions, including those contained in his pro se brief, and find each of them to be similarly encompassed by the waiver of his right to appeal.

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered May 22, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment containing 20 counts against defendant, he pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea bargain, County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to seven years in prison, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant failed to preserve his argument that County Court erred in granting the People’s application to amend the indictment, as he did not oppose that application (see People v Wimberly, 86 AD3d 806, 807 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 863 [2011]; People v Rivera, 22 AD3d 888, 889 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 780 [2006]). Defendant’s valid waiver of appeal forecloses his argument that the court erred in denying his motions (see People v Frasier, 105 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v Lewis, 95 AD3d 1442, 1443 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 998 [2012]), as well as his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that are not related to the plea process or the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Abdullah, 122 AD3d 958, 959 [2014]; People v Barton, 113 AD3d 927, 928 [2014]).
We reject defendant’s argument that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, inasmuch as the record belies his assertion that County Court coerced him into pleading guilty. The court’s statements regarding defendant’s sentencing exposure were informative, not coercive (see People v Ross, 117 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2014]; People v Seuffert, 104 AD3d 1021, 1022 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1009 [2013]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered February 27, 1997, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Convicted after a trial of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 8V3 to 25 years and a concurrent sentence of one year, respectively. We reject defendant’s contention that imposing the most severe sentence possible for selling a relatively small quantity of cocaine is harsh and excessive (see, e.g., People v Charron, 198 AD2d 722, 723, lv denied 83 NY2d 803). In imposing the sentence, the record demonstrates that County Court appropriately considered evidence tending to establish defendant’s involvement in drug trafficking as well as defendant’s failure to accept responsibility for his actions and his lack of remorse. Notwithstanding the fact that the sentence imposed was much more severe than that offered to defendant in a proposed pretrial plea agreement, defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was in retaliation for exercising his right to trial is not supported by the record (see, e.g., People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838). Finally, because defendant was convicted after a trial upon legally sufficient evidence, he is precluded from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence before the Grand Jury (see, People v Carey, 241 AD2d 748, 751, lv denied 90 NY2d 1010; People v Schulze, 224 AD2d 729, lv denied 88 NY2d 853).

"Lahtinen, J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 10, 2001, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and tampering, with physical evidence.
After allegedly being observed by police with numerous bags of crack cocaine, defendant was arrested and eventually indicted for the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and tampering with evidence. Defendant, a second felony offender, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a sentence of 6 to 16 years in prison. He appealed and we reversed since the prison sentence was not authorized by the controlling statutes (282 AD2d 834 [2001]). Defendant was then offered a sentence of 6 to 12 years, which he rejected, electing instead to proceed to trial. He was found guilty by a jury of the three crimes charged in the indictment and received concurrent sentences of incarceration, the longest of which was 12½ to 25 years. Defendant appeals.
We are not persuaded by defendant’s contention that the sentence was harsh and excessive or should be modified in the interest of justice. With respect to his argument that he was allegedly penalized for deciding to exercise his right to a jury trial, we have previously observed that “[t]he mere fact that a sentence imposed after trial is greater than that offered in connection with plea negotiations is not proof that defendant was punished for asserting his right to trial” (People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, 867 [1992], lvs denied 80 NY2d 838 [1992]; see People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 411-412 [1980], cert denied 449 US 1087 [1981]). Defendant had a lengthy criminal record, including numerous prior drug-related arrests and violent felony convictions. County Court stated that the sentence was in response to defendant’s recidivism, lack of remorse and previous failures at rehabilitation. Under such circumstances, the sentence was within County Court’s discretion (see People v Miles, 8 AD3d 758, 761 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 678 [2004]; People v Franklin, 288 AD2d 751, 756 [2001], lv denied, 97 NY2d 728 [2002]; People v Amadeo, 268 AD2d 672, 673-674 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 832 [2000]). There is no indication in the record that the sentence was motivated in any respect by retaliation or vindictiveness because defendant exercised his right to trial (see People v Simon, supra at 867). Nor are we persuaded by defendant’s further assertion that County Court imposed a lengthy sentence as a result of being “clearly impassioned” by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred one month before sentencing.
Defendant’s pro se argument that County Court improperly precluded him from impeaching the police officers was neither preserved for appeal nor is it supported by the record. We find no merit in defendant’s further pro se challenge to County Court’s determination that there was probable cause for his arrest. One of the officers, who was an experienced member of the narcotics unit, testified at the suppression hearing about watching from an unmarked car as defendant counted bags of crack cocaine. This evidence, which County Court found credible, established probable cause for the arrest (see People v Earley, 244 AD2d 769, 770-771 [1997]; see also People v Maldonado, 86 NY2d 631, 635-636 [1995]).

"Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered May 5, 2005, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, without a hearing.
In October 2002, defendant was convicted of robbery in the third degree. He was adjudicated a youthful offender and was sentenced to six months in jail with five years of probation. While on probation, he was charged with, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. He pleaded guilty to this crime and was sentenced to lVs to 4 years in prison. Shortly thereafter, he pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation. His probation was revoked and he was resentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years to run consecutive to the prison term imposed for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 2Vs to 7 years. Defendant thereafter moved, among other things, to set aside the sentence as illegal. County Court denied the motion and this Court granted him permission to appeal.
Defendant asserts that inasmuch as he was adjudicated a youthful offender, County Court’s imposition of a consecutive sentence upon resentencing is illegal because it results in an aggregate sentence which exceeds four years. We disagree and affirm. In a felony case, when youthful offender status is granted, a sentence in excess of four years is not authorized (see CPL 720.20 [1] [a]; Penal Law § 60.02 [2]; § 70.00 [2] [e]). Thus, a defendant may not be sentenced as a youthful offender to two consecutive four-year terms (see People v Richard P., 12 AD3d 382 [2004]; People v Lucci, 193 AD2d 623 [1993]; People v David “H”, 70 AD2d 205 [1979]), even if those convictions occurred in different counties (see People v Vincent Z., 82 AD2d 165 [1981]). Moreover, if the only New York conviction is one in which a de fendant is sentenced to an indeterminate term of 1 to 3 years as a youthful offender, that sentence may not be imposed consecutively with an existing out-of-state determinate term of seven years (see People v Ralph W.C., 21 AD3d 904 [2005]). Here, defendant’s arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, these cases are inapposite. Defendant’s second New York conviction was as an adult. Because defendant is being sentenced for a violation of his youthful offender probation, there is no prohibition against running his youthful offender probation violation sentence consecutively to the sentence imposed upon his conviction as an adult (see People v Van Hoesen, 213 AD2d 944 [1995], lv denied 85 NY2d 981 [1995]; see also People v Simmons, 188 AD2d 668 [1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 893 [1993]).

Although our decision in People v Vincent Z. (supra) does not specifically state that the defendant was granted youthful offender status when he pleaded guilty in Saratoga County, we note that he was thereafter granted youthful offender status in Warren County Had he been convicted as an adult in Saratoga County, he would not have been eligible for youthful offender treatment in Warren County (see CPL 720.10 [2] [b]).",,573,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered July 11, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that the concurrent prison sentences he received of 2 to 6 years upon his plea of guilty were harsh and excessive. The sentences were well within the statutory limits (Penal Law § 70.00 [2], [3]) and were imposed in accordance with the plea-bargain agreement. Other charges were also dismissed as a result of his pleading guilty. Under these circumstances, County Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal ""from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 16, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as a result of allegations that he sold cocaine to an undercover police investigator. On appeal, he contends that County Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the investigator’s identification of him and relatedly argues that such error tainted his subsequent guilty plea. We are unpersuaded.
Upon our review of the testimony at the Wade hearing, as well as the photographic array utilized by the police in this matter, we are satisfied that defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied. Testimony at that hearing revealed that approximately three weeks after the investigator purchased cocaine from defendant in a well-lit apartment in the middle of the afternoon, she immediately identified him in a photo array. The investigator testified that she was face to face with defendant that afternoon and was able to clearly observe his facial features. Moreover, the photo array consisted of six males of comparable age and with similar skin tones, facial characteristics and hair styles. In sum, contrary to defendant’s contention, the photo array was conducted according to proper police procedure and was not unduly suggestive (see People v McDonald, 306 AD2d 696, 697 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661 [2002]).
Finally, we are also unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that his sentence as a second felony offender to 7 to 14 years in prison is harsh and excessive. As part of the plea bargain in this case, the People agreed not to seek persistent felony offender status against him. Moreover, County Court stated on the record during sentencing that it had fully intended to impose the maximum sentence on defendant, but that it would accede to the People’s recommendation of 7 to 14 years. Given these factors, as well as defendant’s criminal history (see People v Fulford, supra), the record discloses no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed and we decline to disturb it.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered July 28, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On February 22, 2006, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in a superior court information. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as second felony offender to six years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Although defendant was initially to be sentenced on April 20, 2006, sentencing was adjourned until August 25, 2006 to provide him the opportunity to care for his wife during her high risk pregnancy. On July 26, 2006, however, following a report of domestic violence, County Court reconvened the proceedings. During the proceedings, it was revealed that defendant’s wife had given birth 11 days earlier and that she and the baby were residing in a domestic violence shelter. Consequently, County Court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant appeals.
The adjournment of sentencing is a matter left to the discretion of the trial court (see People v Schnackenberg, 269 AD2d 618, 619 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 925 [2000]; People v Alpern, 217 AD2d 853, 855 [1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 897 [1995]; see also CPL 380.30 [3]). We find no merit to defendant’s contention that County Court abused its discretion in accelerating his sentencing date given that the reason for the adjournment no longer existed at the time the proceedings were reconvened. Inasmuch as defendant received the sentence agreed to as part of the plea, we find no reason to disturb the judgment of conviction.

"Malone Jr., J.
Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), entered April 9, 2007, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 and 440.20 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and to set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
In satisfaction of two indictments charging him with numerous drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal, agreed to be sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison and signed a written “cooperation” agreement requiring him to assist law enforcement officials in certain investigations. At sentencing, defendant admitted that he did not fulfill the terms of the cooperation agreement and, as result, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of 4 to 12 years in prison. No direct appeal followed, but defendant eventually brought the present CPL article 440 motion seeking to vacate the judgment of conviction or, alternatively, to set aside the sentence. County Court denied the motion and this Court granted permission to appeal.
Initially, defendant claims that the written cooperation agreement cannot be considered part of the plea agreement because it was not referred to by that name at the plea hearing and that, therefore, the enhancement of his sentence based upon his failure to comply with it was improper. Preliminarily, we note that defendant is not precluded by his waiver of appeal from raising this claim (see People v Terrell, 41 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2007]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]). Nevertheless, we find it to be without merit. Viewed in the context of the plea proceedings, the cooperation agreement was signed by defendant and his counsel the same day that defendant entered his guilty plea and it is clearly the agreement referenced at the plea hearing. The fact that it was not identified as such in open court is understandable given the sensitive nature of the subject matter and the need for confidentiality. Significantly, prior to defendant’s entry of his guilty plea, County Court expressly stated that the execution of the written agreement was one of the terms of the plea agreement, and defendant communicated his understanding on the record. County Court informed defendant that if he failed to comply with the terms of the plea agreement, it would not be obligated to impose the promised sentence. In view of the foregoing, we find no error in County Court’s imposition of an enhanced sentence based upon defendant’s failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement (see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 894-895 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]).
Defendant further contends that he was deprived of the effec tive assistance of counsel. This claim, however, survives defendant’s waiver of appeal only to the extent that it impacts the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Hall, 16 AD3d 848 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 887 [2005]; People v White, 300 AD2d 830, 832 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 586, 633 [2003]). Of the many assertions advanced by defendant in this regard, the only one that arguably does so is his claim that counsel erroneously failed to make a motion to withdraw the plea after the sentence was enhanced based upon a condition that was allegedly not a part of the plea agreement. However, inasmuch as this argument could have been raised on direct appeal, it is not the proper subject of a CPL 440.10 motion (see CPL 440.10 [2] [c]; People v Hickey, 277 AD2d 511, 511 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 964 [2000]). In any event, given defendant’s admitted failure to comply with the cooperation agreement that was an integral part of the plea agreement, counsel’s failure to make a motion to withdraw did not deprive defendant of meaningful representation (see People v Rose, 41 AD3d 1033, 1035 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 926 [2007]; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 798 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 980 [1999]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 31/s to 10 years. His appellate counsel argues that the sentence imposed upon defendant by County Court is harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal as part of his guilty plea, the sentence may not now be challenged (see, People v Holder, 191 AD2d 910). Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits, we would find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a prison term of 31h to 10 years given defendant’s extensive criminal record and the fact that the sentence imposed was actually less than the sentence agreed to by defendant as part of the plea bargain. We have considered the numerous contentions raised in defendant’s pro se supplemental brief and find that they are either unpreserved for our review or lacking in merit.

County Court fully advised defendant of the terms of the plea bargain and the consequences of the plea, including that he was waiving his right to appeal. He acknowledged his acceptance of the plea and his understanding that he was waiving his right to appeal (see, People v Li Castro, 179 AD2d 890, lv denied 79 NY2d 1003; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039). Thus, the waiver is fully enforceable and precludes appellate review (see, People v Marziale, 182 AD2d 1035, lv denied 80 NY2d 835).
Defendant further argues that the waiver was invalid because he was pressured to accept the plea bargain based on the Trial Judge’s refusal to recuse himself. He claims that he was forced to either accept the plea or face a trial before that Judge. This claim is in essence a challenge to the voluntariness of the plea itself. There is, however, no evidence that the plea was coerced. Defendant acknowledged that he had enough time to consider the terms of the plea, that he had consulted with his attorney and that he had not been pressured. Sufficient inquiry was made by County Court to defendant and thus the plea itself was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made (see, People v Ross, 182 AD2d 1022, appeal dismissed 80 NY2d 934).
Defendant also claims that the waiver of his right to appeal did not include a waiver of his right to challenge whether the sentence was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Under the circumstances of this case, defendant’s waiver extended to a waiver of his right to challenge his sentence. He negotiated for the sentence and it was promised to him as part of the plea agreement (see, People v Burk, 181 AD2d 74, lv denied 80 NY2d 927; see also, People v Moissett, 154 AD2d 786, affd 76 NY2d 909). In any event, the sentence of 5 to 15 years’ imprisonment was well within the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2], [3]), was in accordance with the plea bargain and was in full satisfaction of a 30-count indictment. We therefore can find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

"Kane, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (DiStefano, J.), rendered December 14, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After an extensive, multi-county investigation regarding an organized drug distribution network, defendant and several other individuals were indicted on multiple counts. In satisfaction of the charges in the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 9 years pursuant to the plea agreement, and now appeals.
Defendant argues that the indictment must be dismissed because it was not signed by the grand jury foreperson as required by statute (see CPL 200.50 [8]). Defendant did not move to dismiss the indictment on this ground and waived his right to appeal as part of his plea, so this unpreserved argument is reviewable as of right only if the missing signature renders the indictment jurisdictionally defective (see People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978]; People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 681 [2002]; People v Diaz, 233 AD2d 777, 777 [1996]; People v Webb, 177 AD2d 524 [1991], lv denied 79 NY2d 924 [1992]).
More than a century ago, the Court of Appeals held that where an indictment did not include the grand jury foreperson’s indorsement but the grand jury appeared in open court to duly present the indictment, it is assumed that it was presented according to law; the certification is not part of the indictment but merely statutory proof of authentication, and the record of personal appearance before the court evidences the authentication (see Brotherton v People, 75 NY 159, 162 [1878]). Similarly, here, the foreperson’s signature was absent from the indictment, but when it was handed up and unsealed, the foreperson was present in court and swore under oath that the indictment — described by caption, indictment number and counts — had been voted upon as a true bill by the required number of grand jurors. While a technical violation of the statute (see CPL 200.50 [8]), and not to be condoned as a routine practice, this procedure satisfied the purpose of authentication. Questions regarding the sufficiency of grand jury evidence were addressed by defendant through appropriate motions (see CPL 210.30). Hence, the indictment should not be dismissed, and complaints regarding this technical, nonjurisdictional defect were forfeited by defendant’s plea of guilty (see People v Cox, 275 AD2d 924, 925 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 962 [2000]).
Because we find the indictment valid, we reject defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument based on counsel’s failure to move to dismiss the indictment for lack of the foreperson’s signature. Finally, defendant’s waiver of appeal precludes his challenge to the severity of the sentence (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Ackerley, 297 AD2d 861, 862 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 554 [2002]; People v Wade, 297 AD2d 877, 877 [2002]), which, in any event, is meritless. The sentence was agreed upon as part of defendant’s plea to one of several counts of the indictment. Defendant’s remaining contentions have been reviewed and are unpersuasive.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered January 3, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In accordance with a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a five-count indictment, and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. Defendant appeals, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as evidenced by counsel’s failure to advise him of his right to challenge the credibility of the confidential informant by requesting an Aguilar /Spinelli hearing.
By his failure either to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, the issue of whether defendant received the effective assistance of counsel has not been preserved for our review (see People v Johnson, 288 AD2d 501, 502 [2001]). Were we to consider the issue, however, we would find it to be without merit. The failure of defense counsel to make a particular pretrial motion does not, by itself, establish ineffective legal assistance (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Garnsey, 288 AD2d 761, 762 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 754 [2002]). Our review of the record discloses that defense counsel made appropriate pretrial motions and provided defendant with competent representation as evidenced, in particular, by his negotiation of a most favorable plea (see People v Powell, 299 AD2d 574, 575 [2002]).
Defendant’s challenge to his guilty plea is similarly not preserved for our review, given the failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685 [1993]; People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]). The issue is, in any event, clearly meritless as are the remaining issues raised herein.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), rendered May 5, 1986, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree.
As a result of an investigation undertaken by the Town of Colonie Police Department in Albany County, defendant was indicted for numerous crimes by a Grand Jury. A jury trial ensued and, after the jury had commenced their deliberations, County Court was advised that a juror was experiencing some health problems. With the consent of the parties, County Court waived the sequestration requirements of CPL 310.10 and the jury was permitted to go home during a recess, separately and unsupervised. Eventually, defendant was found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 22Vz years to life and 12½ to 25 years, respectively. This appeal followed.
Defendant contends that County Court erred in failing to keep the deliberating jury continuously together under supervision as required by CPL 310.10. We agree. Although this court has held that the provisions of CPL 310.10 could be waived (People v Silvernail, 55 AD2d 72, 75; cf., People v Thomas, 91 AD2d 857; People v Clayborn, 50 AD2d 952), the Court of Appeals has now made it clear that a defendant cannot, consonant with his right to a trial by jury, consent to a procedure at variance with the statute’s mandate that the jury be kept secluded during deliberations (People v Coons, 75 NY2d 796, 797; see, People v Ahmed, 66 NY2d 307, 310-311). Moreover, because the error affects the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings prescribed by law (see, People v Ahmed, supra, at 310; People v Patterson, 39 NY2d 288, 295, affd 432 US 197; see also, People v Coons, supra), it presents a question of law for our review even if acceded to.
Because there must be a new trial, we deem it appropriate to note that we find defendant’s remaining contentions on appeal to be without merit, with two exceptions. First, we agree with defendant that his arrest did not justify a search of his entire residence. The police had probable cause to arrest defendant and exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into his residence (see, People v Dominquez, 141 AD2d 833, 834). Thus, the search and seizure of the tangible property in the bathroom was proper, either as a search incident to arrest or under the plain view doctrine (see, People v Knapp, 52 NY2d 689, 694-695, 697). However, once defendant had been apprehended, the urgency had dissipated and the police had time to secure a search warrant (see, supra, at 696). Therefore, any evidence seized outside of the bathroom should have been suppressed.
Finally, we also note that the admission of testimony that at the time of defendant’s arrest he was found to have $700 in cash on his person, including no part of the ""buy money”, was improper. The Fourth Department has held, and we agree, that ""[i]f a defendant is charged * * * with one isolated drug sale * * * any evidence that [the] defendant was possessed of a large sum of money, either at the time of his arrest or at the time of the sale, is inadmissible” (People v Whitfield, 144 AD2d 915; see, People v Jones, 62 AD2d 356, 357; compare, People v Wells, 159 AD2d 799; People v Jones, 138 AD2d 405, 406, lv denied 71 NY2d 1028).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Halloran, J.), rendered September 20, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant was arrested after a search of his vehicle at a United States Border Patrol checkpoint uncovered 100 pounds of marihuana. Defendant subsequently waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime charged in exchange for the People’s promise to recommend a term of imprisonment of two years. Prior to accepting his plea, County Court advised defendant that a period of postrelease supervision of one to two years would be imposed and that no promises or commitments were otherwise being made regarding sentencing. Subsequently, although the People recommended a two-year prison term, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant contends that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea based on his sentence exceeding the term the People agreed to recommend pursuant to the plea agreement. While defendant did move to vacate his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20, his failure to make a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment renders this issue unpreserved for review (see People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]; People v Hartford, 217 AD2d 798, 800 [1995]). Moreover, reversal in the interest of justice is unwarranted. While a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea when the plea was induced by a court’s sentencing promise and the court subsequently finds that sentence to be inappropriate (see People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340, 346 [1980]; People v Martin, 17 AD3d 775, 776 [2005]), County Court explicitly informed defendant during the plea allocution that there were no promises being made regarding his sentence and advised him of the potential maximum sentence that he faced, which he indicated that he understood. Absent a commitment by the court to sentence defendant pursuant to the People’s recommendation, the imposition of a harsher sentence did not entitle him to withdraw his plea (see People v Bunce, 45 AD3d 982, 984 [2007]; People v McKenzie, 28 AD3d 942, 943 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Hartford, 217 AD2d at 799-800). Finally, while we agree with the People that County Court’s remarks regarding the “Indian Nation” were “intemperate” and would have been better left unsaid, the sentence imposed was not harsh and excessive given the enormous amount of contraband involved herein.

Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal impersonation in the second degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, which was conditioned upon defendant’s right to pursue appellate review of his statutory speedy trial claim, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of two years followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision and executed a written waiver of appeal.
By pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his right to appellate review of his claim that his statutory right to a speedy trial (see CPL 30.30) was violated (see People v Di Donato, 87 NY2d 992, 993 [1996]; People v O’Brien, 56 NY2d 1009, 1010 [1982]). However, at the time of the plea allocution, County Court not only failed to advise defendant of this direct consequence of his plea, it specifically advised defendant that “you still retain your right to appeal the 30.30 decision.” Consequently, we agree with defendant that his plea of guilty was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary. To the extent that defendant failed to properly preserve this issue, we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to reverse and vacate the plea (see People v Hill, 9 NY3d 189, 191 [2007], cert denied 553 US —, 128 S Ct 2430 [2008]; People v Morbillo, 56 AD3d 694, 694-695 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 786 [2009]; cf People v Jackson, 64 AD3d 1248, 1249-1250 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 745 [2009]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered August 7, 1995, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was arrested after selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant contends that her sentence is harsh and excessive and constitutes an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court. We disagree. The sentence was within the statutory guidelines and was the agreed-upon result of a plea bargain. While this is defendant’s first criminal conviction, she has nonetheless been found guilty of a serious crime. Hence, the sentence imposed by County Court cannot be characterized as an abuse of discretion and we decline to disturb it (see, People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893, 894; People v Willis, 200 AD2d 903, 904).

Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based upon her sale of the narcotics oxycodone and oxymorphone to an undercover police officer. Pursuant to an agreement reached with County Court, defendant entered an Alford plea to the charges and began serving a one-year term of interim probation. If defendant successfully completed the interim probation, County Court would sentence her to five years of probation. However, if defendant failed to comply with the terms of the interim proba tion, she could be sentenced to any legally permissible sentence that County Court deemed appropriate. Defendant did not comply with the interim probation and was sentenced to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision.
Defendant’s contention that County Court erred in accepting her plea without first holding a competency hearing pursuant to CPL 730.30 is not preserved for our review as the record before us indicates that she has failed to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rought, 90 AD3d 1247, 1248 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 962 [2012]; People v Klages, 90 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 925 [2012]). The narrow exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or cast doubt upon the voluntariness of her plea (see id.). Although defendant was taking several prescription medications, the transcripts of her plea and other proceedings reflect that they did not affect her ability to understand the proceedings or make an intelligent choice from among the alternatives available to her (see People v Amidon, 79 AD3d 1158, 1159 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 741 [2011]; People v Gomez, 72 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2010]).
Defendant also claims that her sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant was afforded the opportunity to avoid prison. However, she failed to comply with the terms of her interim probation and did not take responsibility for these crimes or her conduct underlying the probation violation. We perceive no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the sentence imposed, which falls within the authorized sentencing range (see Penal Law §§ 70.45 [2] [b]; 70.70 [2] [a] [i]; 220.39; People v Dowling, 92 AD3d at 1035; People v Smurphat, 91 AD3d 980, 981 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 962 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered June 24, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a superior court information, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that County Court would sentence him to 3 to 9 years in prison. After accepting the plea, the court admonished defendant that if he failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing the court would be authorized to impose an enhanced sentence of up to SVs to 25 years in prison. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing and was returned to court on a bench warrant several months later and sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. On defendant’s appeal, defense counsel — following the appropriate procedure — submitted a brief seeking to be relieved of his assignment as counsel on the ground that no nonfrivolous appealable issues exist (see, People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see also, Anders v California, 386 US 738). The People submitted a letter agreeing with defense counsel’s position. Defendant submitted a pro se letter to this Court arguing that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]) and requesting that new appellate counsel be assigned. For reasons to be explained, we conclude that a decision on this appeal should be withheld, defense counsel’s motion to be relieved of counsel should be granted and new appellate counsel should be assigned.
Where, as here, a defendant pleads guilty but did not waive his right to appeal and an enhanced sentence is imposed based upon the trial court’s determination that he or she violated a term of the plea agreement, the defendant has a statutory right to argue on appeal to the Appellate Division that the enhanced sentence imposed — though lawful — was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]; 450.10 [2]; People v Thompson, 60 NY2d 513, 518-520; People v Coleman, 30 NY2d 582; see, e.g., People v Morton, 275 AD2d 865; People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713; People v Ramsey, 269 AD2d 616, lv denied 94 NY2d 951; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, lv denied 94 NY2d 879; People v Rogers, 166 AD2d 679; People v Jackson [Everett], 130 AD2d 510; see also, People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780; People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264, 268; People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606).
To be distinguished, we have repeatedly adhered to the rule that a defendant’s valid waiver of appeal executed pursuant to a plea agreement generally precludes our review of a claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive, although the legality of a sentence is never waived (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7-10; People v Etkin, 277 AD2d 599; People v Smith, 272 AD2d 782, 783, lv denied 95 NY2d 871; People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 790-791, lv denied 95 NY2d 833; People v Johns, 267 AD2d 718, lv denied 94 NY2d 949; People v Young, 253 AD2d 982, lv denied 92 NY2d 1055; see also, People v Ross, 276 AD2d 649; People v lorio, 276 AD2d 564). Thus, in a plethora of appeals wherein the defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently pleaded guilty, waived all appeal rights and received the lawful, negotiated sentence, we affirmed the judgment of conviction and granted defense counsel’s application pursuant to People v Cruwys (113 AD2d 979, supra) and Anders v California (386 US 738, supra) to withdraw (see, People v Carney, 276 AD2d 920; People v Mochrie, 276 AD2d 831; People v Villaronga, 272 AD2d 641; People v Carter, 271 AD2d 708, lv denied 95 NY2d 794; People v Haennel, 269 AD2d 698; People v Kwiatkowski, 268 AD2d 681, lv denied 94 NY2d 949; People v Gage, 261 AD2d 660; cf., People v Cobbs, 276 AD2d 917). We have also affirmed convictions and granted defense counsel’s Anders motions to withdraw in appeals involving defendants who pleaded guilty and were sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement but who did not waive their right to appeal (see, People v Jandreau, 276 AD2d 925; People v Goodrich, 276 AD2d 832; People v Cook, 273 AD2d 543; People v Waddell, 272 AD2d 639; People v Roundtree, 261 AD2d 715).
Likewise, we have held that where a defendant, who concomitantly validly pleaded guilty and waived all appeal rights receives an enhanced sentence based upon a violation of the terms of the plea agreement, any claim addressed to the harshness or excessiveness of the enhanced sentence falls within the scope of the waiver of the right to appeal, provided the defendant is informed of the maximum potential sentence for noncompliance with the plea agreement (see, People v Perham, 263 AD2d 766, lv denied 93 NY2d 1045; see also, People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, supra; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, supra [upheld waiver on appeal where no sentence promised at plea]; People v Burnice, 272 AD2d 882, lv denied 95 NY2d 863; People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 790-791, supra; People v Miles, 268 AD2d 489, lv denied 95 NY2d 800; cf., People v Covell, 276 AD2d 824 [conditions of plea not clear, therefore appeal waiver did not preclude review of enhanced sentence]; People v Parker, 271 AD2d 63 [defendants entitled to challenge enhancements because waiver of appeal did not encompass plea terms which failed to comport with due process]).
However, where, as here, defendant did not waive his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement and an enhanced sentence was imposed, we cannot conclude that an appeal raising the issue of the harshness and excessiveness of the enhanced sentence would be “wholly frivolous” although, by distinction, it may ultimately be determined to be without merit (see, People v Vasquez, 70 NY2d 1, 3; People v Saunders, 52 AD2d 833, 834; see also, Anders v California, 386 US 738, 744, supra; People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606, 611, supra; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980, supra). Accordingly, since this issue is arguable on its merits, defendant is entitled to assignment of new counsel to argue the appeal (see, People v Cruwys, supra, at 980; People v Saunders, supra, at 834), with the Court taking no position on the merits of the appeal.
In withholding a decision and assigning new counsel, we decline to decide the appeal on the record and Anders brief before us, as no immediate decision appears justified or necessary (see, People v Cruwys, supra, at 980; People v Crawford, 71 AD2d 38, 39; People v Saunders, supra, at 834; cf., People v Wasson, 266 AD2d 701, 702, n). Although we have on occasion commented that a particular sentence was not harsh and excessive in the context of affirming a conviction and granting defense counsel’s application pursuant to Anders to withdraw (see, e.g., People v Snow, 273 AD2d 549; People v Phillips, 271 AD2d 760; People v Hastings, 271 AD2d 707; People v Deanne, 270 AD2d 515; People v Ben-Levi, 269 AD2d 697), acceptance of an Anders brief and granting defense counsel’s motion to be relieved more correctly indicate that the issues are “wholly frivolous” and lack any arguable merit and do not result in a determination on the merits of arguable issues (see, Anders v California, supra, at 744; People v Vasquez, supra, at 3; People v Saunders, supra, at 834). Deciding an arguable issue — such as the fairness of an enhanced sentence — which a defendant is statutorily permitted to raise in this Court in the absence of the “single-minded” advocacy of appellate counsel may, in particular cases, work to deprive a defendant of effective assistance of counsel to which he or she is entitled (see, People v Casiano, 67 NY2d 906; People v Gonzalez, supra, at 609-611; People v Emmett, 25 NY2d 354, 356; see also, Anders v California, supra, at 743-744).
Recognizing that the courts, prosecutors and the defense bar are increasingly grappling with the burden of frivolous appeals and that there has been an increase in the use of Anders briefs, we take this opportunity to offer some guidance. Where a defendant who pleads guilty but does not execute a waiver of appeal receives an enhanced sentence due to noncompliance with terms of the plea agreement and requests assigned counsel to challenge the severity of the sentence or to raise other arguably meritorious issues on appeal, the proper course is to submit a brief addressing these issues as an advocate rather than to submit an Anders brief. We believe that this practice will most effectively “assure that an indigent criminal appellant receives substantially the same assistance of counsel as one who can afford to retain an attorney of his [or her] choice” (People v Gonzalez, supra, at 610; see, Douglas v California, 372 US 353).
Cardona, P. J., Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is withheld, application to be relieved of assignment granted and new counsel to be assigned.
However, if a defendant is not advised at the time of the plea of the maximum sentence he or she could face, the appeal waiver does not encompass the right to challenge the sentence as harsh and excessive (see, People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513; cf., People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825).",,1609,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"— Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the County Court, Orange County (Charde, J.), imposed July 25, 1986, upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, the sentence being an indeterminate term of 8V3 years’ to life imprisonment.
Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.
The defendant claims that it was error to pronounce sentence in the absence of a presentence report prepared by the Orange County Department of Probation. He acknowledges that prior to sentencing the court had before it a presentence report prepared by the Ulster County Department of Probation and a supplemental presentence report prepared by the Greene County Department of Probation with respect to two separate convictions arising from the same investigation which led to the instant conviction. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that a separate report specifically relating to the Orange County indictment was required.
Assuming, in the first instance, that a separate report as to the present incident was required, we find upon this record that any violation of CPL 390.20 was waived. The sentence was the result of a negotiated plea and the defense counsel specifically agreed, on the defendant’s behalf, to proceed to sentence on the basis of the Ulster County and Greene County presentence reports which were prepared shortly before the instant sentence was imposed (see, People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93, 98; People v Dowdell, 72 AD2d 622; People ex rel. Seaman v Warden, 53 AD2d 848; cf., People v Andujar, 110 AD2d 606).
In any event, we are of the opinion that the court was sufficiently apprised of the information relevant to sentencing as to be capable of imposing the appropriate and agreed-upon term of imprisonment (see generally, People v Sanchez, 143 AD2d 377; People v Goon, 124 AD2d 347; cf., People v Jackson, supra). The Ulster County and Greene County reports provided a detailed account of the defendant’s family, employment, educational and criminal background and history and the basis for the ongoing narcotics investigation of the defendant by the New York State Police.
Nor do we find the sentence imposed to be excessive. The sentence was the result of a negotiated plea bargain which substantially reduced the defendant’s sentencing exposure. The defendant was sentenced as promised and, thus, he will not now be heard to complain that his sentence was excessive. Mollen, P.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Teresi, J.), rendered November 17, 2005 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Supreme Court thereafter sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement as a predicate felon to IV2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s assertions that his guilty plea was involuntary and he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Myricks, 36 AD3d 1006, 1006 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 948 [2007]). In any event, defendant’s claims are without merit. During the plea colloquy, defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to speak with his attorney and was satisfied with his services. He also acknowledged that he understood his rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty and freely admitted the facts underlying the crime. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant entered his plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see People v Means, 35 AD3d 975, 976 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 948 [2007]) and, noting the favorable plea agreement which reduced his sentence exposure, received meaningful representation (see People v Lewis, 39 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2007]).
Finally, we have considered defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive, yet find it to be unavailing. Nothing in the record convinces us that Supreme Court abused its discretion nor are there any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the negotiated sentence (see People v Qasem, 39 AD3d 960, 961 [2007]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 8, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered January 8, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was originally charged in an indictment with promoting prison contraband in the first degree. Although County Court dismissed the indictment on the basis that defendant had not received proper grand jury notice, this Court reversed that order and ordered that the indictment be reinstated (94 AD3d 1334, 1334-1335 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 968 [2012]). Following reinstatement of the indictment, but prior to its resolution, police officers responding to a domestic dispute at defendant’s apartment found over 500 milligrams of cocaine. Defendant ultimately waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree by superior court information.
Defendant then pleaded guilty to attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the indictment and superior court information and waived his right to appeal both convictions. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of IV2 to 3 years for the prison contraband charge and IV2 years for the controlled substance charge, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He was released prior to sentencing and, while on release, he was arrested in Orange County. County Court thereafter found defendant in violation of a condition of his release and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an enhanced prison term of 2 to 4 years on the prison contraband conviction and four years in prison on the criminal possession of a controlled substance conviction, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, with the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, although County Court should have more thoroughly distinguished the right to appeal from the rights forfeited upon pleading guilty, the detailed written waivers of the right to appeal executed by defendant and his counsel acknowledged defendant’s separate and distinct right to appeal, confirmed that he had discussed the waivers and their consequences with counsel and affirmed that he was voluntarily waiving the right. County Court confirmed that defendant understood the waivers and that he did not need any further time to discuss them with counsel. Under these circumstances, the record reflects that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal his convictions and sentences was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1290-1291 [2010]). In light of his valid appeal waiver, defendant’s challenge to County Court’s suppression ruling is precluded (see People v Morrison, 106 AD3d 1201, 1202 [2013]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094 [2013]).
Defendant’s contention that his guilty plea to attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary — which survives his appeal waiver — is nonetheless unpreserved as the record does not reveal that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]; People v Hare, 110 AD3d 1117, 1117 [2013]). Further, while we agree that defendant’s statements prior to the plea colloquy that the cell phone in question was not “dangerous contraband” reveal some equivocation as to an essential element of the crime to which he later pleaded guilty (see Penal Law § 205.25 [2]; People v Pagan, 36 AD3d 1163, 1164-1165 [2007]), we are satisfied that, during the ensuing discussion with County Court, defendant was properly informed and understood that, if he went to trial, it would be up to the jury to determine whether or not the cell phone was dangerous contraband (see People v Green, 119 AD3d 23, 26-27 [2014]). Defendant did not raise the issue thereafter, including during the plea colloquy itself, and the record reflects that, following this discussion, defendant knowingly chose to accept a favorable plea deal rather than risk conviction following a trial. Accordingly, inasmuch as the record demonstrates that defendant’s concerns were clarified and his plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Goodell, 104 AD3d 1026, 1026 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1138 [2014]; People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).
Finally, defendant argues that County Court erred in impos ing an enhanced sentence. We agree. Although this issue is not precluded by his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved inasmuch as he failed to object to the enhanced sentence or make an appropriate motion (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d 1186, 1186 [2012]; People v Lindsey, 80 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2011]; People v Donnelly, 80 AD3d 797, 798 [2011]; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d 1453, 1454 [2009]). Despite this failure to preserve the issue, we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action.
A sentencing court may not impose an enhanced sentence unless it has informed the defendant of specific conditions that the defendant must abide by or risk such enhancement, or give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his or her plea before the enhanced sentence is imposed (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1186; People v Lindsey, 80 AD3d at 1006; People v Becker, 80 AD3d 795, 796 [2011]; People v Fisher, 76 AD3d 1122, 1122 [2010]; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d at 1454). Here, County Court enhanced defendant’s sentence due to defendant’s arrest while on release pending sentencing. However, the record reflects that defendant was never warned that County Court would not be bound by its sentencing commitment if he were arrested while out on release. Consequently, County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence without first providing defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1186-1187; People v Becker, 80 AD3d at 796-797; People v McDermott, 68 AD3d at 1454; People v Armstead, 52 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]). Accordingly, we vacate defendant’s sentence and remit the matter to County Court to impose the agreed-upon sentence or give defendant the option of withdrawing his plea before imposing the enhanced sentence (see People v Lewis, 98 AD3d at 1187; People v Fisher, 76 AD3d at 1122).

Contrary to the People’s contention, defendant’s promise to County Court that he would not “get in trouble” if he were released is not “an explicit and objective” condition that could provide a basis for the enhancement of defendant’s sentence (People v Becker, 80 AD3d at 796).","Peters, EJ., Lahtinen, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur.",1221,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J), rendered December 19, 2006, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, based upon her sale of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, as well as in satisfaction of certain outstanding charges and an ongoing investigation concerning defendant’s unauthorized use of her mother’s credit card. Sentencing was adjourned for one year with the understanding that defendant was to complete a long-term residential drug and alcohol treatment program. After completing this program, defendant was to be sentenced to time served plus five years of probation. However, it was also understood that if defendant failed to complete the rehabilitation program, she may be sentenced to a prison term of up to 5½ years.
Three months after entering the rehabilitation program, defendant was discharged for violating program rules. Based on defendant’s failure to complete the rehabilitation program, County Court found her in violation of her plea agreement and sentenced her to a term of 5½ years in prison, with two years of postrelease supervision, and ordered her to pay restitution of $848.33 based on her unauthorized use of her mother’s credit card. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant initially contends that there was insufficient evidence that she violated the plea agreement. We disagree. County Court held a hearing where evidence was presented that defendant had violated program rules, including, among other things, testing positive for opiates and having beer hidden in her luggage. Therefore, we find that County Court’s inquiry was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant had failed to successfully complete the long-term rehabilitation program and had violated the plea agreement (see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]; People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712 [1993]).
However, defendant’s plea agreement, which satisfied outstanding charges and ongoing investigations against her, including the investigation concerning the unauthorized use of her mother’s credit card, did not include the payment of restitution. As the plea agreement did not include restitution or the possibility that restitution might be imposed, this matter must be remitted to County Court to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw her plea or accept the enhanced sentence. Alternatively, the court may resentence defendant as promised in the plea agreement (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 978 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 925 [2007]; People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708-709 [2005]).
Finally, as defendant validly waived her right to appeal, she is precluded from contending that her sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Cross, 42 AD3d 586, 587 [2007]; People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).

"Kane, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, Jr., J.), rendered July 14, 2004, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Defendant was indicted for several crimes related to her sale and possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia. When County Court arraigned her on the indictment on January 14, 2004, she was represented by counsel who had apparently been assigned by City Court after defendant’s arrest. After defendant expressed her desire to hire a different attorney, County Court informed her that she and her attorney needed to be aware of the 45-day time limit to file motions. Assigned counsel appeared with defendant at a January 29, 2004 conference, where she rejected an offer to plead to a reduced charge and receive a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. Defendant apparently attempted to retain private counsel, but was unsuccessful. On March 22, 2004, assigned counsel filed demands for a bill of particulars and discovery, but he did not file an omnibus motion until May 28, 2004. The court denied the motion as untimely and adhered to that decision upon reargument. After the jury convicted defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, the court imposed a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years on the felony count and concurrent one-year sentences on the misdemeanor counts. Defendant appeals.
County Court did not err in denying defendant’s omnibus motion as untimely. All pretrial motions must be filed within 45 days of arraignment, unless the defendant is not represented by counsel and has requested an adjournment to obtain counsel or have counsel assigned, in which case the 45-day period will begin when counsel appears on defendant’s behalf (see CPL 255.20 [1]). The statutory exception does not apply to defendant because she was represented by assigned counsel and never requested an adjournment to retain private counsel. Although defendant argues that assigned counsel did not represent her for a period while she made inquiries regarding retaining new counsel, assigned counsel remained counsel of record since neither defendant nor assigned counsel moved to have assigned counsel relieved by the court. Even if we accepted defendant’s contention that she was unrepresented for a period of time, assigned counsel certainly represented her when he filed demands for discovery and a bill of particulars and when he filed the omnibus motion more than 45 days following those demands. Hence, the omnibus motion was untimely and the court was authorized to summarily deny it (see CPL 255.20 [3]; People v Augustine, 235 AD2d 915, 916 [1997], appeal dismissed 89 NY2d 1072 [1997], lv denied 89 NY2d 1088 [1997]).
A court may summarily deny any pretrial motions filed after the 45-day period, although the court, in the interest of justice and for good cause shown, has the discretion to entertain untimely motions on the merits (see CPL 255.20 [3]; People v Davidson, 98 NY2d 738, 739 [2002]). We cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to entertain the omnibus motion on its merits where, as here, defendant failed to show good cause for her delay in filing the motion (see People v Augustine, supra at 916-917), and counsel made the motion returnable on the day fixed for jury selection.
Finally, defendant’s sentence was not harsh or excessive. She was on probation for a similar charge at the time that she committed these crimes and County Court imposed less than half the maximum permissible sentence. We are unpersuaded by defendant’s argument that the court unfairly punished her by imposing a longer sentence than the one offered as part of a plea bargain (see People v Castle, 251 AD2d 891, 893 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 923 [1998]). The offer was to plead guilty to a class D felony as a reduced charge. A longer sentence is justified by her conviction of a class B felony and two misdemeanors. The lesser offer prior to trial also reflected the People’s acknowledgment of their risk in going to trial with a drug addict as a primary prosecution witness, a circumstance that was not a factor after trial (compare People v Morton, 288 AD2d 557, 559 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 758 [2002], cert denied 537 US 860 [2002]).

"Lynch, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered July 16, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In October 2013, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts). He thereafter pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal in open court. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to five years of probation, imposed 100 hours of community service and ordered him to pay restitution. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant maintains that he was deprived of meaningful representation concerning his plea because defense counsel misinformed him that he could still appeal a claim of juror bias. This issue came to light at sentencing. When asked by County Court if he wished to be heard, defendant responded, “I guess the only thing I wanted to say is that I wanted to make sure — I know you can’t appeal this, but I wanted to appeal the things that — [defense counsel] said I can go to the [a]ppellate [c]ourt, because the member of the grand jury was a friend of mine for six years, a neighbor.” Defense counsel directly responded that “[h]e certainly can appeal it” and added, “I’ve explained it to him probably 20 times” — leaving little question that “it” refers to the juror bias claim. Defendant countered, “No, today was the first time you ever explained that to me.” County Court left the issue unresolved, simply responding that “if you feel you have an appealable issue that the Appellate Division can hear you certainly have the right to appeal.”
While defendant couches his claim in terms of an invalid appeal waiver, we find that defendant’s claim actually presents a threshold question of forfeiture, i.e., whether a claim of potential juror bias in the grand jury survives a plea. Notably, defendant made no such specific claim in his preplea motion to dismiss the indictment, contending only generally that the proceedings were impaired by irregularities (see CPL 210.35 [5]; compare People v Washington, 82 AD3d 1675, 1676 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 1106 [2012]). County Court denied the motion, finding no infirmities in the grand jury minutes that would warrant a dismissal. Since we do not perceive the claim to be jurisdictional or to implicate “rights of a constitutional dimension that go to the very heart of the process” (People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]), we conclude that a claim of juror bias would actually be forfeited upon a guilty plea (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d at 231).
Inasmuch as defendant’s misunderstanding as to his ability to appeal the juror bias issue was brought to County Court’s attention at sentencing, we find that defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea has been sufficiently preserved for our review (see generally CPL 470.05 [2]; compare People v Garay, 25 NY3d 62, 67 [2015], cert denied 577 US —, 136 S Ct 501 [2015]; People v Green, 54 NY2d 878, 880 [1981]), notwithstanding the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion. Once County Court learned that defendant had been given erroneous advice by counsel, the court should have conducted a further inquiry to ascertain whether defendant wished to go forward with the plea (cf. People v Bendross, 153 AD2d 75, 76-77 [1989]). Absent such inquiry by County Court, and in light of the fact that the record otherwise presents “a genuine issue of fact as to the knowing, intelligent and voluntary nature of defendant’s guilty plea” (People v Bass, 118 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 24 NY3d 959 [2014]; compare People v Santiago, 121 AD3d 528, 528 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]), this matter must be remitted to County Court to afford defendant an opportunity to either accept the plea that was offered or move to withdraw his plea (cf. People v Denegar, 130 AD3d 1140, 1141-1142 [2015]). By so concluding, we are not resolving the question as to whether defendant was deprived of meaningful representation — only referring that question to County Court for resolution in the first instance.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Aison, J.), rendered February 20, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant, in a negotiated reduced plea, agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of all charges against him. In return, defendant was offered a prison sentence of 2 to 4 years, with the court making the sentence contingent on defendant’s not being arrested or convicted of any crime between the plea and sentence. In the event of such a happenstance, defendant could receive a harsher sentence with the option of withdrawing his plea.
Defendant was in fact charged with the commission of a felony before sentence. On February 20, 1992, he appeared before County Court and was offered the option of withdrawing his plea of guilty, having a hearing to determine whether he had actually committed a crime between his plea and sentencing, or proceeding with the plea agreement but with an enhanced prison sentence of 2 Vi to 5 years. Defendant, after consultation with his attorney, agreed to continue with the plea agreement and was sentenced to 2 Vi to 5 years.
On this appeal, defendant argues that his waiver of appeal executed on October 15, 1991 was not an effective waiver of his right to appeal the sentence rendered February 20, 1992. Defendant contends that in failing to demand of him the execution of a second waiver of appeal, there is no bar to an appeal by him of his February 20, 1992 sentence. We disagree. The record indicated that the plea and proceedings before County Court on October 15, 1991 and continued on February 20, 1992 are part of a single plea agreement. We thus hold that defendant waived his right to appeal as a condition of his plea bargain. Defendant’s right to appeal is relegated only as to the question of illegality of sentence or lack of voluntariness of the plea, issues he does not raise (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY 1, 10).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Breslin, J.), rendered August 29, 2012 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to a 5V2-year prison term followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Following entry of his plea and during the course of his presentencing interview, defendant made remarks to the probation officer denying that he had been aware of possessing the drugs underlying his conviction. Thereafter, at sentencing, Supreme Court specifically questioned defendant regarding these statements, asking repeatedly whether he wished to either make any statement to the court or withdraw his guilty plea, and he consistently answered “no.” As there is no indication in the record that defendant moved at any time thereafter to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim that the court erred in proceeding to sentence defendant in accord with his plea agreement is not preserved for our review (see People v Colon, 106 AD3d 1367, 1368 [2013]). Nor does the record reveal that the narrow exception to the preservation rule is applicable (see People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).
Supreme Court took the necessary precautionary steps throughout the course of the proceedings to ensure that defendant’s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. The court
thoroughly explained the rights that defendant was forfeiting and the consequences of the plea, making a series of pertinent inquiries. The record thus fully demonstrates that defendant, who was represented by counsel, voluntarily entered the plea with knowledge and understanding (see People v Youngblood, 107 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1078 [2013]; People v Ramires, 264 AD2d 948, 949 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 906 [2000]).
Supreme Court further advised defendant as to the effect of the waiver of appeal and inquired as to whether he had questions with respect to that separate issue for either his counsel or the court. Defendant thereafter waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence both orally on the record and by a written waiver executed before the court. We find this record adequate to demonstrate his voluntary and knowledgeable waiver (see People v Johnson, 106 AD3d 1331, 1332 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1016 [2013]; People v Foote, 102 AD3d 1056, 1057 [2013], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]; People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]). As Supreme Court advised, defendant’s valid waiver of appeal forecloses the evidentiary challenges he now seeks to raise (see People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1094 [2013]; People v Frierson, 21 AD3d 1211, 1212 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 753 [2005]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered May 30, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of subdivision 1 of section 220.39 of the Penal Law. On appeal defendant claims that the sentence to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum of not less than four years and a maximum of natural life, as mandated by section 70.00 of the Penal Law for violation of subdivision 1 of section 220.39 of the Penal Law, violates his constitutional rights under the United States and New York Constitutions as cruel and unusual punishment and in violation of due process and the equal protection of the law; that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel; that prosecution witnesses gave inadmissible evidence and that the Assistant District Attorney made unwarranted and prejudicial statements in his summation. This court recently decided in People v Venable (46 AD2d 73) that the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under section 70.00 of the Penal Law for the criminal sale of narcotic substances does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions. The defendant was represented on the trial by counsel retained by him. The record discloses a vigorous defense. Counsel made motions to inspect the Grand Jury minutes, to suppress identification testimony and to suppress oral statements and real evidence. The transcript demonstrates lengthy and penetrating cross-examination by defendant’s counsel. Defendant was adequately represented (People v Tomaselli, 7 NY2d 350). The court finds no reversible error in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses concerning the statements made by the defendant at the time of the transaction or in the summation of the Assistant District Attorney. The defendant is entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect trial (People v Kingston, 8 NY2d 384). Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J.

"Crew III, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered December 23, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In December 1993, defendant was the subject of a six-count indictment, charging him with three counts of assault in the second degree and one count each of the crimes of resisting arrest and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. Prior to sentencing, defendant made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which County Court denied and defendant was sentenced to the previously agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years. Defendant appeals on the ground that his guilty plea was involuntary.
Defendant argues in essence that the ineffective assistance of counsel rendered by the Public Defenders assigned to his case compelled him to plead guilty, thereby rendering his plea involuntary. It should be noted that while defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude judicial review of the voluntariness of his guilty plea (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10; People v Marziale, 182 AD2d 1035, 1036, lv denied 80 NY2d 835), it does preclude review of his claimed denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel except insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea (see, People v Wood, 207 AD2d 1001; People v Hayes, 194 AD2d 998). To the extent that this issue has been preserved for our review, there is nothing in the record to support defendant’s claim that his plea was rendered involuntary by defense counsel’s conduct.
To the contrary, the record discloses that defendant made it impossible for the Assistant Public Defender to prepare a defense by reason of defendant’s refusal to communicate with him. When County Court substituted the Public Defender as defense counsel, defendant expressed dissatisfaction with her services as well, electing to plead guilty after a trial date had been set and voir dire was under way. There is no indication that either of the attorneys assigned to defendant’s case would have been other than competent and effective had the case gone to trial. Indeed, the record reflects that the Assistant Public Defender was instrumental in procuring a favorable plea bargain on defendant’s behalf (see, People v Reid, 224 AD2d 728). It is apparent that defendant’s perceived difficulties in preparing a defense were not caused by shortcomings on the part of defense counsel but were instead self-imposed. We conclude that defendant’s plea was voluntary and that County Court correctly exercised its discretion by denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

In satisfaction of a five-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced as a predicate felon to a prison term of 21/2 to 5 years. He argues that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has a lengthy record of drug-related crimes and was charged with five such crimes in the present indictment. In view of this, as well as the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 9, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. He was sentenced to two years in prison, followed by two years of postrelease supervision.
Initially, defendant’s assertion that his guilty plea was involuntarily entered is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Vanguilder, 32 AD3d 1110 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 904 [2006]). In any event, were we to consider this contention, we would find that County Court fully advised defendant of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and it discussed the terms of the plea agreement, which included no sentencing commitment by the court other than that the sentence imposed would not exceed two years in prison. Defendant acknowledged that he understood these rights as well as the consequences of pleading guilty. Defendant then confirmed that he was entering the plea freely and admitted to having committed the crime. Under these circumstances, the record establishes that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and received the benefit of the plea bargain (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Schwing, 13 AD3d 725 [2004]).
With regard to defendant’s challenge to the validity of his verbal appeal waiver, we agree that the waiver was insufficient inasmuch as it failed to comply with the requirements set forth in People v Lopez (6 NY3d 248 [2006]). Given this conclusion, we have considered defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive and find it to be unpersuasive. There is no indication in the record that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence, nor are there any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the' interest of justice (see People v Smith, 32 AD3d 1082, 1082 [2006]).

Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, waiving his right to appeal.

Defendant has, however, failed to preserve this issue for our review (see, People v Wilson, 209 AD2d 792, lv denied 84 NY2d 1040) and it is, in any event, without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered February 2, 2009, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of forgery in the second degree.
In satisfaction of the charges contained in a superior court information, defendant pleaded guilty to forgery in the second degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to enter a drug treatment program. The agreement provided that, if defendant successfully completed the program, she would be permitted to withdraw her plea, plead guilty to forgery in the third degree and receive three years of probation. If she did not, she would be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison upon her original plea of guilty to forgery in the second degree. Defendant entered the program, but did not successfully complete it, resulting in the imposition of a sentence of 2V2 to 5 years in prison. She now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record characterized by numerous drug-related offenses and was given ample opportunity to undergo treatment to address her drug problem, all to no avail. In view of this, and given that the sentence imposed was specifically agreed to by defendant as part of the plea agreement, the sentence is not harsh and excessive (see People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 927 [1996]; see also People v Wilson, 219 AD2d 758 [1995], lv denied 86 NY2d 875 [1995]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered February 11, 2010, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of, among other things, the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In April 2002, he was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of 12V2 to 25 years. In July 2002, following defendant’s guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, he was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 8 years, with the sentence to run consecutively to the prison term he was already serving. In January 2009, defendant applied for resentencing pursuant to CPL 440.46 on his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following a hearing, County Court vacated the April 2002 sentence as to this crime and resentenced defendant to nine years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, with the sentence to run consecutively to his July 2002 sentence. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that his resentence of nine years is harsh and excessive. We disagree.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Williams, J.), rendered March 8, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of third degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine), a class B felony, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement. The plea was taken in full satisfaction of charges brought and which could be brought against defendant stemming from a narcotics trafficking investigation conducted in Sullivan and Delaware Counties. In exchange for his plea, defendant was to receive concurrent prison sentences of 4 to 12 years. The agreement included a protection order prohibiting defendant from any interaction with others involved in the narcotics investigations, whether they be informants or potential defendants. Following the plea allocution, defendant was released on a $125,000 property bond, purportedly to allow him to cooperate in prosecuting other criminals and, in the event he did so, the possibility of receiving a shorter term, as well as the opportunity to put his affairs in order. When defendant twice failed to appear for sentencing, his bail was forfeited, he was indicted for bail jumping in the first degree and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued. Several months later he was arrested, operating under an assumed name. At sentencing, the People asked for concurrent sentences of 8V3 to 25 years, arguing that defendant had breached his part of the plea bargain by failing to appear for sentencing. County Court sentenced defendant accordingly and defendant appeals.
At the outset it is noted that the issue raised on appeal, viz., conformity of the sentence to defendant’s plea agreement, was put forth and ruled upon immediately following sentencing and thus is reviewable despite the absence of a formal CPL 440.10 or 440.20 motion (cf., People v Martinez, 125 AD2d 829).
On the merits, it is fundamental that a bargained-for sentence may not be exceeded simply because a defendant failed to appear for sentencing as scheduled unless his timely appearance was an explicit or implied condition of the sentencing agreement (People v Sumner, 137 AD2d 891, 892). During defendant’s plea allocution the District Attorney and, even more so, County Court stressed that the slightest infraction of the protection order would free the court to impose a harsher sentence than that agreed upon. By contrast, the only penalty apparently contemplated for failure to appear at sentencing was forfeiture of the bail bond and, necessarily, any criminal prosecution that conduct generated. Since defendant did not breach any of the provisions of the sentencing agreement, County Court erred by exceeding its terms. Under the circumstances, defendant was entitled to have the court adhere to the agreement or offer him an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757). However, since defendant’s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and we do not find the sentence bargained for inappropriate, there is no reason not to adhere to it.
Judgment modified, on the law and the facts, by reducing defendant’s sentence to an indeterminate term of 4 to 12 years’ imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, and, as so modified, affirmed.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Mullen, J.), rendered November 16,1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged in two separate indictments with the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third and fifth degrees and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth, fifth and seventh degrees. Initially, he entered a plea of not guilty. However, on August 22,1983, the day his trial was scheduled to begin, defendant withdrew the not guilty plea and, pursuant to a plea-bargaining agreement, pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
On September 9,1983, defense counsel notified the trial court that defendant wished to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it was the product of duress. Defendant alleged that his guilty plea had been coerced by a threat which he had received in jail on the eve of trial, when a fellow inmate warned him that he would be seriously injured or killed if he took the stand and mentioned the name of a certain defendant in another drug case.
Following a hearing on September 20, 1983, defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea was denied. He was subsequently sentenced as a predicate felony offender, pursuant to the plea bargain, to a term of two to four years’ imprisonment.
On this appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We disagree. At the guilty plea withdrawal hearing and in his subsequent appearances before the court, defendant raised his allegations of duress but failed to substantiate them with any supporting evidence. Accordingly, the trial court was faced only with the issue of defendant’s credibility, which it resolved against him. It has been held that a defendant is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea based solely on subsequent unsupported allegations of innocence (People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55, 56-57; cf. People v Flowers, 30 NY2d 315, 317). This is especially true where, as here, the transcript of the plea hearing reveals that defendant’s plea was voluntarily and knowingly made. In the instant matter, defendant was ably represented by an attorney with whom he stated that he had fully discussed the advisability of his guilty plea. Further, defendant admitted in his allocution the necessary elements of the crimes charged, and stated that he entered the plea voluntarily and understood the terms of the plea bargain. In turn, the trial court fully apprised defendant of the consequences of his plea (see People v Eagan, 90 AD2d 909; People v Brockway, 88 AD2d 1039, 1040). Given this exhaustive colloquy, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in subsequently denying defendant permission to withdraw his plea (see id.).
We are similarly unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the trial court erred in not holding a full blown evidentiary hearing on this issue. Only in rare instances will such a hearing be necessary (see People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926). However, in this case, the record discloses that defendant and defense counsel were afforded ample opportunity to present evidence of defendant’s allegations before the court and that they failed to do so. Accordingly, there is no indication that the court abused its discretion in failing to hold a full evidentiary hearing (see People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940, 941).
Finally, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s contentions that the trial court erred in not permitting him to proceed pro se and in not considering his pro se motions. The record reveals, first, that defendant at no time requested permission to proceed pro se. Second, defendant’s counsel informed the trial court that the arguments made in defendant’s handwritten pro se motion papers (which the court found illegible) had been incorporated in defense counsel’s own motion papers. Accordingly, there was no need for the trial court to render separate decisions on each of defendant’s pro se motions.

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered May 2, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
The record demonstrates that, in full satisfaction of various drug-related charges, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant contends that his guilty plea was not voluntarily made and the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive.
Initially, we note that, while defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives a waiver of his right to appeal, his failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment renders it unpreserved for our review (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662). In any event, the transcript of the plea proceedings demonstrates that County Court fully explained the rights being surrendered by his guilty plea and defendant acknowledged the relinquishment of those rights. He stated that his mind was clear and he had not consumed any alcohol or taken medication. At that same time, defendant also indicated that he was not being coerced to enter the plea and had, in fact, sold cocaine. Accordingly, were we to reach the merits, we would find that defendant’s plea was voluntary (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814; People v Richardson, 295 AD2d 763, 764).
Furthermore, since defendant waived his right to appeal as part of his guilty plea, his assertion that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive is also unpreserved for our review (see People v Wyche, 289 AD2d 870, 870; People v Church, 287 AD2d 788, 788-789, lv denied 97 NY2d 680). Nevertheless, were the merits before us, given defendant’s past involvement in drug activity, the fact that the agreed-upon sentence was the result of a beneficial plea bargain and the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of judicial discretion, we would find a modification in the sentence is not warranted (see People v Bell, 290 AD2d 729, 730; People v David, 263 AD2d 615, 615).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), rendered September 6, 2011, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant contends that his plea of guilty was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered because the County Court allegedly misinformed him of the potential sentence that he would receive if he pleaded guilty. The plea minutes reveal that the defendant was advised by the County Court that the promised prison term would be capped at nine years, with three years of postrelease supervision, provided that the defendant complied with the conditions of his plea agreement. The defendant acknowledged that he understood the terms of the promised sentence and the conditions of his plea agreement. At sentencing, after defense counsel spoke on the defendant’s behalf and the defendant made a statement on his own behalf, the County Court imposed a sentence of nine years of imprisonment plus a period of three years of postrelease supervision. Contrary to the defendant’s contention, an objective reading of the plea agreement demonstrates that its terms were complied with, and the defendant’s misinterpretation of the agreement or his disappointment with his sentence does not suffice as a reason for vacating his plea of guilty (see People v Cataldo, 39 NY2d 578, 579-580 [1976]; People v Hulsey, 244 AD2d 358, 359 [1997]; People v Martin, 235 AD2d 551 [1997]; People v Davis, 161 AD2d 787, 788 [1990]; People v Welch, 129 AD2d 752 [1987]).
The defendant’s contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed, at sentencing, to argue for a lesser sentence than that imposed is belied by the record. Furthermore, the defendant is deemed to have been furnished meaningful representation, since he received an advantageous plea and the record does not cast doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see People v Henry, 95 NY2d 563, 566 [2000]; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Moss, 74 AD3d 1360 [2010]; People v Garrett, 68 AD3d 781, 782 [2009]; People v Boodhoo, 191 AD2d 448, 449 [1993]).

"Weiss, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered May 28, 1985, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On September 7, 1984, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based on his sale of cocaine to an undercover City of Albany police officer on October 26, 1983. On April 22, 1985, the morning of the scheduled trial, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. No promises as to sentencing were made except for County Court’s agreement not to sentence defendant as a persistent felon. At sentencing, defendant requested leave to withdraw his plea, contending that the late disclosure of a tape recording between defendant and an undercover police officer, coupled with the prosecutor’s ostensible misrepresentation of the sentence during plea negotiations, deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel and coerced his plea. The prosecutor responded that the tape recording was to be used only to rebut the agency defense, if needed, and that the plea bargain proposed on April 19, 1985, which included a sentence of 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment, was made subject to the court’s approval. Defense counsel acknowledged that he misunderstood this qualification of the proposed plea. County Court denied the application and sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of IVi to 15 years. This appeal ensued.
Defendant’s assertion that he was deprived of an opportunity for a fair trial by the People’s failure to timely disclose the tape recording was effectively waived by his plea of guilty (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, cert denied 475 US 1150; People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1). In any event, since defendant concededly had an opportunity to hear the tape in its entirety prior to pleading guilty, no prejudice has been demonstrated.
We further find no abuse of discretion in County Court’s refusal to vacate the plea. This is not an instance where the plea was induced by a sentencing promise which the court was subsequently unwilling or unable to fulfill (see, e.g., People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). Any misunderstanding as to the sentence to be received was clarified by the court prior to the entry of defendant’s plea of guilty, when the purported prison term of 3 to 6 years was rejected. Moreover, a review of the plea allocution confirms that defendant was thoroughly apprised of the consequence of his plea, that he acknowledged that he had been given a full opportunity to discuss the matter with his attorney, that the plea was of his own free will and that he was pleading guilty to avoid a potential persistent felony offender sentence. Accordingly, County Court could readily determine that defendant’s plea was not coerced and thus refuse his request for withdrawal (see, People v Austin, 117 AD2d 835; People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677; People v Cooke, 61 AD2d 1060).
Nor can we agree with defendant’s assertion that the confusion attendant the plea negotiations deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. Not only is this contention belied by the plea minutes, but the record confirms that meaningful representation was provided (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137). Once retained, counsel made appropriate motions for disclosure of the tape and, since defendant faced a potential persistent felony offender sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment (see, Penal Law § 70.10 [2]), he also secured a favorable plea bargain (see, People v Kelsch, supra, at 678). By defendant’s own account, counsel ceased trial preparation in reliance on the proposed plea bargain just two days before the scheduled trial date. Given this time frame, the fact that counsel again heard the tape recording on the morning of the trial and the voluntary nature of the plea, we perceive no undue prejudice to defendant.
Defendant’s assertion that the second felony offender statute (Penal Law § 70.06) is unconstitutional, in that the 10-year qualifying period is measured from the date of the sentencing to the commission of the offense under review, is without merit (Penal Law § 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]; People v McGill, 132 AD2d 846). Finally, County Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the terms of the plea bargain and the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] M).

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Lehmann, J.), rendered February 25, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Thereafter, he pleaded guilty in September 2003 to the criminal sale count in full satisfaction of all charges and, in return, it was agreed that defendant’s sentencing would be adjourned in order for him to complete the “Road to Recovery Program,” a substance abuse treatment program. According to the terms of the agreement, upon successful completion of the program, defendant would be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea and request dismissal of the superior court information. In signing the agreement, defendant specifically acknowledged that if he failed to complete any aspect of the program, he would receive a sentence within the range of dVa to 9 years to 121/2 to 25 years. Subsequently, defendant absconded from the program without completing his obligations. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest and he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison.
Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s various claims challenging the terms of the agreement. Significantly, “[c]onditions imposed as part of a plea arrangement are valid if the parties agree to them and they do not violate any statute or contravene public policy” (People v Avery, 85 NY2d 503, 507 [1995]). Here, the record establishes that defendant entered an intelligent, knowing and voluntary plea of guilty and there is no support for the argument that his planned participation in the Road to Recovery Frogram was coerced (see People v Juckett, 17 AD3d 867, 868 [2005]). Instead, the record reveals that defendant failed to abide by an explicit condition of his plea agreement, therefore, County Court was free to impose a sentence in accordance with its terms (see generally People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841, 842 [1993]).
We also do not agree with defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed by County Court was unduly harsh. Despite his argument that the court did not take into consideration his request for leniency, it is notable that the court did impose the minimum sentence contemplated under the plea agreement, namely 4V2 to 9 years. Furthermore, although defendant claims that County Court erred in not reducing his sentence in accordance with the Drug Law Reform Act, we note that his crimes were committed prior to that law’s effective date and, therefore, said statute was not applicable (see People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676, 677 [2006]).
We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Lynch, J.), rendered May 22, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The agreement included a waiver of appeal and provided that defendant would be sentenced to a prison term not to exceed four years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He was released under supervision pending sentencing and, while released, allegedly violated the condition of his release that he refrain from committing additional crimes or illegal activity by being arrested on drug sale charges. Following several adjournments, the parties reached a renegotiated agreement providing for defendant to receive a prison sentence of seven years followed by three years of postrelease supervision, in full satisfaction of the original plea as well as the new charges. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence, and defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that County Court erred in imposing what he characterizes as an “enhanced” sentence because he was not warned on the record at the time of his guilty plea of the consequences of being arrested or committing additional crimes while released pending sentencing, and he was not offered an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. While this issue is not precluded by defendant’s earlier appeal waiver, it was not preserved for our review due to his failure to object on this ground at sentencing or move to withdraw his guilty plea on this basis (see People v Nesbitt, 144 AD3d 1329, 1329 [2016]). In any event, the record reflects that the parties renegotiated the terms of the plea agreement to provide that the plea would satisfy all of the new charges in exchange for a higher prison sentence of seven years with three years of postrelease supervi sion. As the higher sentence was not an “enhancement,” but rather the product of a renegotiated agreement to which all parties consented, the court was obligated neither to impose the original agreed-upon sentence nor offer defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea (see People v Dunsmore, 275 AD2d 861, 862-863 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 934 [2000]). Defendant’s remaining claims also lack merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County, rendered June 25, 1975, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant raises two issues on this appeal neither of which has merit. The periods of delay between the time of defendant’s arrest on November 4, 1974 and his plea on June 17, 1975 which are the basis of his first argument were not significant in extent and there is no allegation that any delay alleged herein was the result of the failure of the People to be ready for trial (CPL 30.30). Additionally, there has been no demonstration that he has been prejudiced by the alleged delays (see People v Imbesi, 38 NY2d 629). We find no basis for defendant’s remaining contention, based upon the claimed involuntariness of the plea. Defendant’s plea was in satisfaction of a three-count indictment. At the time the plea was entered, defendant responded to the inquiry of the court by stating that the only promise made to him in connection with the plea was the agreement of the People to recommend the minimum sentence. He also admitted selling a narcotic drug for the sum of $20. Defendant received the minimum sentence, just as promised.

"In satisfaction of three separate indictments charging him with a number of crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, driving while intoxicated and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Consistent with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of six years on the criminal sale conviction, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, lVa to 4 years on the driving while intoxicated conviction, and 21/2 years on the criminal possession conviction, to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record characterized by numerous drug and alcohol-related offenses. In view of this, and given that the agreed-upon sentence exposed defendant to significantly less prison time than he could have faced if convicted after trial, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Williams, 76 AD3d 1141, 1142 [2010]; People v McPherson, 76 AD3d 1117 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered July 14, 2003, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree after she attempted to smuggle heroin to a prison inmate during a visit at a correctional facility. Defendant was sentenced to 180 days in jail and five years’ probation. We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention on appeal that the condition of probation precluding any contact with the inmate to whom she tried to smuggle the drugs violates her constitutional right of freedom of association. A court has broad discretionary powers to set the conditions of probation which it “deems reasonably necessary to insure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him [or her] to do so” (Penal Law § 65.10 [1]) and which are “necessary or appropriate to ameliorate the conduct which gave rise to the offense” (Penal Law § 65.10 [5]). Defendant’s relationship with the inmate in question marked the onset of her criminal activity and the record establishes that defendant planned to continue the relationship despite the inmate’s manipulation and negative influence. Under these circumstances, it is our view that the no-contact condition of defendant’s probation was reasonably related to her rehabilitation (see People v Page, 266 AD2d 733, 735 [1999]; People v Griffith, 239 AD2d 705 [1997]; People v Howland, 145 AD2d 866 [1988]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered April 29, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment. Subsequently, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 5 to 10 years. On this appeal, defendant contends that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive. Our review of the record, however, discloses several factors that militate against this argument, including defendant’s extensive criminal history and the fact that he was on parole at the time that he committed the instant offense (see People v Ballinger, 299 AD2d 738, 739 [2002]). Notably, defendant was sentenced in accordance with his negotiated plea agreement which substantially reduced his sentencing exposure (see People v Munoz, 282 AD2d 775 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 922 [2001]; People v Sanchez, 143 AD2d 953 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 859 [1988]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Intemann, Jr., J.) rendered June 4, 1986, convicting defendant upon its plea of guilty of the crime of unlawful use of secret scientific material.
Defendant, through its president and vice-president, waived indictment and entered a plea to a superior court information. At the time, defendant was advised by County Court that ""in all probability in a plea of guilty * * * the court would sentence [defendant] to pay a fine” not to exceed $50,000. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine in that amount. However, no finding as to the amount of defendant’s gain from the crime was made by the court at the time of sentencing, nor was a hearing held on the issue prior to sentencing.
On this appeal, defendant complains, and the prosecution agrees, that there was no compliance with the provisions of Penal Law § 80.10 (1) (a) and (e), and where, as here, the fine imposed exceeded $10,000, there must be compliance with Penal Law § 80.00 (3) (see, Penal Law § 80.10 [3]) requiring a hearing to determine the amount of defendant’s gain.

"Appeal by the People from a judgment of the former County Court, Kings County, rendered September 1, 1961 on defendant’s plea of guilty, convicting her of attempted felonious possession of narcotic drugs (Penal Law, § 1751) and sentencing her, as a first felony offender, to serve a term of 3 years and 9 months to 7% years. Judgment reversed on the law, and action remitted to the Criminal Term, Supreme Court, Kings County for resentencing of the defendant as a second felony offender. The facts are affirmed. The court below, at the time of defendant’s sentencing, dismissed a second felony offender information in which it was alleged that defendant had been convicted of a prior felony in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York. Such prior conviction was based on defendant’s guilty plea to an indictment which charged that she did unlawfully “ sell, dispense and distribute ” a quantity of heroin in violation of subdivision (a) of section 4704 of title 26 of the United States Code. This statute provides that it shall be unlawful to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute narcotic drugs, except in or from the original stamped package. Defendant contends that the People have no right of appeal. In our opinion, the People may appeal from this judgment of conviction, pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 518 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (People v. Washington, 278 App. Div. 967; People v. Webster, 279 App. Div. 944, affd. 304 N. Y. 621; People v. Evans, 18 A D 2d 1018). This conclusion is predicated on the fact that, since the statute grants a right of appeal to the defendant, it accords a reciprocal right of appeal to the People. It is also our opinion that the defendant’s prior Federal conviction may properly be used to sentence her as a second felony offender. It is settled that a conviction, under this Federal statute, for a sale, alone, of a narcotic not in or from a tax stamped package, is to be counted a prior felony (People v. Gennaro, 261 App. Div. 533, affd. 287 N. Y. 657; People v. Lana, 10 A D 2d 646, permission to appeal to Court of Appeals den. April 25, 1960 by Judge Fuld, cert. den. 364 U. S. 832). In our opinion, the inclusion of the words “dispense or distribute” in the Federal indictment charged acts which would also be felonious in this State (Penal Law, § 1751, subd. 1; Public Health Law, § 3301, subds. 29, 30).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Ceresia, Jr., J.), rendered March 26, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends that his right to a speedy trial was violated; however, he forfeited his statutory speedy trial claim by his guilty plea (see, People v O’Brien, 56 NY2d 1009). Further, considering the factors set forth in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442, 445), we find no violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial in the nine-month delay between County Court’s order for an in camera inspection of the Grand Jury minutes and its decision based on that inspection. There is also no merit to defendant’s contention that his sentence of 3 to 6 years, the most lenient sentence possible in view of his criminal history and the crime to which he entered his guilty plea, is harsh and excessive or an abuse of discretion.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Keegan, J.), rendered January 19, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends on appeal that County Court exceeded its authority and abused its discretion in revoking his adjudication as a youthful offender at resentencing. First, the plea agreement did not include any guarantee that defendant would be adjudicated a youthful offender. In addition, County Court could not adjudicate defendant a youthful offender and at the same time impose a prison sentence of 2 to 6 years (see, CPL 720.20 [3]; Penal Law § 60.02). Having done so, the court had the power ""to correct its sentence, which was illegal as it stood, by immediately revoking the youthful offender adjudication” (People v Magee, 116 AD2d 742). Finally, given the fact that the sentence was within the plea bargain and County Court found it appropriate in view of the nature of the crime, there was no abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant to 2 to 6 years’ imprisonment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Catena, J.), rendered May 24, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged with various drug-related crimes following three incidents, one in which he sold heroin to a confidential informant and two in which he and another individual sold heroin to undercover police. Defendant was represented by the Public Defender’s office and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. Thereafter, by letter, the Public Defender’s office requested that County Court assign new counsel to represent defendant due to an unspecified conflict of interest but, following a letter from the District Attorney, County Court sent a letter to both sides reflecting that the request had been withdrawn. Defendant, represented by an Assistant Public Defender, proceeded to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and any charges which could be brought against him as of the date of the plea proceedings; he also waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 3V2 to 7 years in prison, and now appeals.
Initially, defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest is foreclosed by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, as this claim is not premised upon the alleged involuntariness of his plea (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003]; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]; compare People v Abar, 290 AD2d 592 [2002], affd 99 NY2d 406 [2003]). Moreover, “defendant’s failure to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction precludes him from raising it” (People v Camp, supra at 630; see People v King, supra at 662).
In any event, considering this claim, we find it to be without merit. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon a conflict of interest, the “defendant must demonstrate that ‘the conduct of his defense was in fact affected by the operation of the conflict of interest, or that the conflict ‘operated on’ counsel’s representation” (People v Longtin, 92 NY2d 640, 644 [1998], cert denied 526 US 1114 [1999], quoting People v Alicea, 61 NY2d 23, 31 [1983]; see People v Harris, 99 NY2d 202, 210 [2002]). Here, the basis for the Public Defender’s request for the assignment of new counsel is not in the record, although we can deduce that it was based upon a perceived conflict of interest arising from its representation of the individual with whom defendant allegedly acted in concert in selling heroin to undercover police. Following a letter from the District Attorney stating that this individual had not been charged and was represented by another attorney, the Public Defender’s office withdrew its request, evidently because it was not representing the other individual. The only development in the case at this point had been the entry of defendant’s not guilty plea. The record discloses that thereafter, the Public Defender’s office made appropriate motions, engaged in proper pretrial discovery and secured a favorable plea bargain. Therefore, although it would have been preferable if the issue had been addressed and resolved on the record, we conclude that no conflict is demonstrated, the conflict alleged did not inhibit counsel’s meaningful representation of defendant, and County Court was not required to conduct a further inquiry (see People v Harris, supra at 211-212).
Moreover, defendant’s waiver of appeal also precludes his challenge to the severity of the sentence (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 661 [2002]; People v Buckner, 274 AD2d 832, 833-834 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 904 [2000]). In any event, no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant modification of this negotiated sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Allen, 301 AD2d 874, 875-876 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]; People v Young, 301 AD2d 754, 755 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 634 [2003]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered August 25, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. On July 15, 1994, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the express understanding that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. At defendant’s request, sentencing was adjourned to permit him to enter into a substance abuse program. Although sentencing was to be adjourned to honor defendant’s request, it was expressly acknowledged by both defendant and his counsel that no promises were made by either the People or County Court that defendant would receive a more favorable sentence in the event he was successful in his rehabilitative endeavors (compare, People v Thompson, 193 AD2d 841).
Following defendant’s participation in several rehabilitation programs, he came before County Court on August 25, 1995 for sentencing. At this time, defense counsel opined that defendant had made good-faith efforts to rehabilitate himself and moved to withdraw the prior guilty plea. In opposing this request, the District Attorney questioned the success actually attained by defendant in the preceding 15-month period and reminded the court that no promises were made to defendant upon his guilty plea in any event. County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 3 to 6 years.
On appeal, defendant requests that this Court remit the matter to County Court for the purpose of conducting a hearing to determine the accuracy of the District Attorney’s statements at sentencing with respect to defendant’s success in rehabilitating himself. Noting that defendant’s participation in rehabilitation was not a condition imposed by County Court prior to sentencing, but rather was an accommodation for defendant’s benefit agreed to by the People and permitted by the court, and in consideration of the fact that defendant knew that even the most successful rehabilitation experience did not guarantee him a more lenient sentence, we find that County Court was free to impose the agreed-upon sentence without offering defendant a chance to prove that his treatment was successful (or disprove the District Attorney’s statements that it was not) or withdrawing his guilty plea. Consequently, the sentence should stand and we decline defendant’s request that we remit the matter in the interest of justice.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered June 17, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of robbery in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
On October 16, 1995, defendant was sentenced to six months in jail and five years’ probation as the result of his pleas of guilty to the crimes of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and robbery in the third degree. Subsequently, on May 3, 1996, defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with robbery in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree for crimes committed while he was on probation. At the same time, defendant pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation. On June 17, 1996, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of five years on the charge of robbery and 5 to 10 years on the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance. On the same date, defendant’s probation was revoked and he was resentenced to a concurrent prison term of 5 to 15 years for violating the terms of his probation. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s primary contention is that County Court erred in sentencing him as a second felony offender because on June 17, 1996, the date he was sentenced, he also was resentenced on the crimes for which he was serving a term of probation and, therefore, those crimes could not serve as predicate convictions for the purpose of sentencing him as a second felony offender. We disagree. We previously have held that “[o]nce a sentence of probation is revoked, the new sentence takes its place (see, CPL 410.70 [5]) * * * [and] can properly form the basis for a predicate felony conviction” (People v Knapp, 113 AD2d 154, 167, cert denied 479 US 844). Inasmuch as the crimes for which defendant was sentenced on October 16, 1995 may form the basis for a predicate felony conviction and, further, were final adjudications as of that date, we conclude that such crimes were properly considered by County Court in sentencing defendant as a second felony offender (see, Penal Law § 70,06 [1] [b] [ii]).
In view of this holding, we find no merit to defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon counsel’s failure to challenge defendant’s sentencing as a second felony offender. Likewise, given defendant’s criminal history and his commission of two crimes while on probation, we find no merit to his claim that the sentence imposed in connection with his viola tion of probation was harsh and excessive (see, People v Barrett, 221 AD2d 772, lv denied 87 NY2d 1017).

"—-Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered May 20, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Initially, defendant maintains that County Court erred when it failed to resolve the photographic identification issue raised by defendant at the start of the suppression hearing. Although the court rendered a decision on the suppression motion with regard to the other issues raised by defendant, it did not address the identification issue. This failure, however, was not brought to the court’s attention prior to when defendant entered his plea of guilty. By pleading guilty prior to a judicial resolution of this issue, defendant waived his right to appellate review of the question of the propriety of the photo identification procedure. As to the question of whether his warrantless arrest was improper, defendant never raised this issue at the suppression hearing; he is therefore also foreclosed from raising this issue on appeal. With respect to defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, the record reveals that he received meaningful and effective representation. Finally, we reject defendant’s claim that the indeterminate prison sentence he received of IV2 to AV2 years was harsh and excessive. It was in accordance with the plea agreement and defendant’s plea was in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered October 22, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to the negotiated prison term of four years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s claim of judicial bias is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Kilgore, 45 AD3d 886, 887 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 767 [2008]; People v McCafferty, 1 AD3d 799, 799 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 743 [2004]) and unpreserved for our review given his “failure to make a motion or otherwise request County Court to recuse itself from the case” (People v Rizzo, 5 AD3d 924, 925 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 646 [2004]; see People v Mao-Sheng Lin, 50 AD3d 1251, 1253 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 961 [2008]).

Defendant’s assertion that County Court erred by allowing the prosecution to participate in the plea allocution is also unpreserved since he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgement of conviction (see People v Montanez, 287 AD2d 407, 408 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 685 [2001]; People v Bonneau, 142 AD2d 890, 890 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 889 [1989]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Meyer, J.), rendered June 3, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was arrested after a substantial amount of cocaine was discovered in his car. He later waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information. Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced to a prison term of five years and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Defendant argues that his constitutional rights were violated by the Essex County Drug Court’s refusal to accept him into the program. As Drug Court is a “procedure! ] utilized in determining and imposing sentence” and has no impact upon the legality of the sentence itself, defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes our review of his argument that he should have been accepted into the program (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 281 [1992]; see People v Hooten, 34 AD3d 941 [2006]). Additionally, the issue is unpreserved due to defendant’s failure to raise it before County Court (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Iannelli, 69 NY2d 684, 685 [1986], cert denied 482 US 914 [1987]; People v Sander, 47 AD3d 1012, 1013 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 844 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Rowley, J.), rendered July 8, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In connection with defendant’s sale of cocaine to a confidential informant and separate possession of cocaine on the same date in November 2004, defendant pleaded guilty in June 2005 to one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In July 2005, after discussions regarding the potential retroactivity of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004, County Court sentenced defendant, pursuant to that new law, to two concurrent prison terms of three years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. The District Attorney appeals, contending that the court should have applied the prior sentencing law. We agree.
The Legislature addressed retroactivity of the new sentencing provisions by directing that the new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law § 70.70 “shall take effect on the thirtieth day [January 13, 2005] after [the Act] shall have become a law, and . . . shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof’ (L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]; see People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 597 n [2005]). While, in the absence of evidence of contrary intent, the general rule is to retroactively apply remedial or ameliorative amendments, explicit legislation setting forth a prospective effective date “is sufficient to overcome any presumption of retroactivity” (People v Sutton, 199 AD2d 878, 879 [1993]; see Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law § 60.04, 2006 Pocket Part, at 60-61). The Legislature’s language in the Drug Law Reform Act “expresses an intent to negate the amelioration doctrine,” thereby permitting the Act to apply only to class B felonies committed after its effective date (People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005]; see People v Fields, 25 AD3d 343 [2006]). Because defendant committed his crimes prior to that effective date, County Court should have sentenced him under the prior sentencing laws.

Defendant contends on this appeal that the sentence of 216 to 7 years’ imprisonment that he received upon his plea of guilty is harsh and excessive.

Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to 4 to 12 years’ imprisonment. Defendant now contends that County Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and failed to exercise discretion in sentencing, and that his sentence is harsh and excessive.
We affirm. There was no abuse of discretion in County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A review of the record reveals that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to confer with his attorney, was satisfied with his representation and admitted his guilt of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see, People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, lv denied 75 NY2d 921). Any reluctance on defendant’s part in entering his guilty plea is attributable not to ""threats or coercion but, rather, defendant’s mere unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation” (People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840, lv denied 79 NY2d 949). Further, given that defendant was afforded an opportunity to state the basis for his withdrawal application, we find no error in the failure of County Court to hold an evidentiary hearing (see, People v Ross, 182 AD2d 1022, lv dismissed 80 NY2d 934). Defendant also offers no evidence to support his allegation that County Court failed to consider the presentence report prior to sentencing (see, People v Carmello, 114 AD2d 965). Finally, in light of defendant’s advantageous plea bargain, by which defendant pleaded guilty to one count in satisfaction of a six-count indictment and received less than the harshest sentence possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4íá to 9 years for his convictions on the sale charges and 2 to 4 years for his conviction on the possession charge. An examination of the plea colloquy convinces us that the plea was voluntary, knowing and intelligent, and that defendant admitted facts sufficient to establish his guilt. We also conclude that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel, and find no error in County Court’s denial of defendant’s request to withdraw his plea based upon his conclusory allegations of coercion by defense counsel and other improprieties. Finally, given defendant’s prior criminal record and the fact that the sentence imposed is the most lenient possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J.), rendered September 13, 2005, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
During a search of the home that defendant shared with her husband, police found bags of heroin, a digital scale, computers, drug-related paperwork and over $47,000 in cash. Defendant was subsequently indicted for a class B drug felony and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class C felony. She was sentenced to five years of probation. Thereafter, she was charged with violating the terms of her probation and pleaded guilty to these charges. In exchange, sentencing was adjourned pending defendant’s completion of a detoxification program and entry into an inpatient rehabilitation facility. When defendant prematurely left the rehabilitation facility, a warrant was issued for her arrest. After she was apprehended, her probation was revoked and she was sentenced to four years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We find no merit to defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. The record discloses that defendant received the benefit of pleading to a reduced charge, as well as the benefit of the joint recommendation of the prosecution and defense that she be sentenced under the amendments to the Rockefeller Drug Laws (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [ii]), which exposed her to much less prison time than she would otherwise have faced upon being convicted of the indicted class B felony. In view of this, as well as her violation of a number of the conditions of her probation, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see generally People v Peterson, 7 AD3d 882, 883 [2004]; People v Carpenter, 278 AD2d 672, 672 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 798 [2001]; see also People v Dabbs, 178 AD2d 848, 849 [1991], lv denied 79 NY2d 946 [1992]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Loyola, J.), rendered July 22, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an eight-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
As an initial matter, we agree with defendant that his appeal waiver was invalid inasmuch as the record reveals that defendant was not advised that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1208 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d 1250, 1251 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). Defendant is therefore not precluded from challenging the severity of the imposed sentence (see People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]; People v Maxwell, 142 AD3d 739, 740 [2016]). We nevertheless find this challenge to be without merit. In view of defendant’s multiple prior drug-related convictions, we discern no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Slamp, 145 AD3d 1320, 1321 [2016]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d at 1251).

Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the period of postrelease supervision from a period of five years to a period of three years; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his convictions is unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484 [2008]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review of the evidence pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).
The defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137 [1981]).
The sentence of imprisonment imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). However, as the People correctly concede, the term of postrelease supervision imposed exceeds the statutorily authorized maximum, and it therefore must be reduced to the extent indicated herein (see Penal Law § 70.45 [2] [d]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered November 7, 2013, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In July 2012, defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging her with criminal nuisance in the first degree stemming from allegations that she allowed heroin to be sold from her apartment in exchange for free drugs and rent money. Defendant pleaded guilty as charged with the understanding that, if she were accepted into and successfully completed the Clinton County Drug Court program, she would be placed on probation for five years with a period of community service and she would be obligated to cooperate and provide truthful testimony against certain codefendants. Defendant was thereafter accepted into the drug court program. In May 2013, upon completion of, among other things, certain inpatient and intensive outpatient treatment, and, based on the availability of a supportive living program in Albany County, County Court agreed to administratively discharge defendant from the drug court program and sentenced her to a period of five years of probation and 100 hours of community service and imposed the requisite $375 in associated fines and surcharges. Four months later, defendant was returned to County Court on a bench warrant for a violation of probation stemming from, among other things, her discharge from the supportive living program. In November 2013, defendant admitted to violating her probation and County Court revoked her probation and resentenced her to a prison term of IV3 to 4 years. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. To the extent that defendant contends that County Court erred in resentencing her without an updated presentence investigation report, such claim is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to request an updated report, raise an objection during resentencing or move to vacate the resentence (see People v Dorfeuille, 127 AD3d 1414, 1414-1415 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 928 [2015]; People v Alexander, 110 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1154 [2014]). With respect to defendant’s claim that her resentence is harsh and excessive, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the resentence in the interest of justice (see People v Crowell, 119 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1083 [2014]; People v Fitzgerald, 100 AD3d 1268, 1269 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1011 [2013]).

In March 2010, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In April 2010, he was charged in a second indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. In two separate proceedings before two different courts, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree for each indictment and also waived his right to appeal. Consistent with the respective plea agreements, he was sentenced on the first conviction to a prison term of 3x/2 years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, and on the second conviction to a prison term of 4V2 years to be followed by three years of post-release supervision, which sentences were to run concurrently. He now appeals.
Defendant’s sole challenge is to the severity of the sentence. He is, however, precluded from making this claim by his valid waivers of the right to appeal (see People v Small, 82 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 801 [2011]; People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 864 [2011]).

Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years after pleading guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. She contends on this appeal that the sentence was harsh and excessive and that she should have been sentenced to a period of probation which would be more likely to result in her rehabilitation. We disagree. The record discloses that defendant has an extensive criminal history and that she was an absconder from parole at the time of the arrest that led to this conviction. In view of her background, defendant would appear to be an unlikely candidate for rehabilitation by a sanction that does not include a period of incarceration. The sentence falls within the permissible statutory ranges and there is no indication that the sentencing court abused its discretion by imposing it or that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered February 24, 2004 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
After refusing to accept several plea bargains, defendant pleaded guilty as charged to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree just prior to the commencement of jury selection for his trial. Supreme Court advised defendant that, because he was required to be sentenced as a second felony offender, a sentence of at least 4xh to 9 years in prison would have to be imposed. However, the court made a commitment to defendant that the longest sentence it would impose would be 6 to 12 years in prison. Ultimately, the court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 5 to 10 years. Defendant retained his right to appeal and now exercises that right.
Defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy which cast significant doubt upon his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see id.). Regardless, defendant’s affirmative answers to Supreme Court’s in quiries sufficiently established the elements of the crimes, that he had not been coerced into pleading guilty and that he understood the proceedings as well as the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty (see People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]).
The sentence imposed is not harsh and excessive under the circumstances. Indeed, despite defendant’s prior criminal history and pattern of substance abuse, Supreme Court sentenced him to less than the longest potential sentence agreed to upon his plea (see People v Coles, supra at 666; People v Butterfield, 9 AD3d 682, 682 [2004]). Furthermore, the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances warranting modification of the sentence imposed (see People v Jenkins, 19 AD3d 745, 745 [2005]; People v Mills, 17 AD3d 712, 713 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered November 21, 1985, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
A November 14, 1984 indictment charged defendant with four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. A later indictment on December 19, 1984 charged defendant with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession in the third degree. The indictments having been consolidated for trial, the People moved, on September 18, 1985, to sever counts Nos. 1 and 2 of the first indictment and to limit the trial on that indictment to the latter two counts, together with both counts of the second indictment. The motion was granted and, after trial, defendant was convicted of all four counts. They all stemmed from sales of cocaine to an undercover police officer. On November 21, 1985 defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 5 to 15 years on his conviction of the two counts charged in the second indictment and 2⅓ to 7 years on his conviction of both counts of the first indictment, all sentences to run concurrently.
On this appeal, defendant challenges only the sentence of 5 to 15 years as harsh and excessive. The sentence imposed was legal and below the maximum that could have been imposed. In the circumstances presented at trial and considering the nature and extent of defendant’s convictions, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court in respect to defendant’s sentencing (see, People v Halvorsen, 60 AD2d 927).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered August 13, 2010, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with various drug-related crimes after she sold cocaine to undercover officers on two separate occasions. In satisfaction thereof, she pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, she was to be sentenced to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that her sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has a history of drug-related offenses and, according to the presentence investigation report, she failed to take responsibility for the crime at issue despite pleading guilty to it. Moreover, defendant agreed to the sentence imposed as part of the plea agreement and, by doing so, avoided a significantly longer sentence than one that could have been imposed if she was convicted after trial. Consequently, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lasanta, 89 AD3d 1324 [2011]; People v Pryee, 36 AD3d 1165, 1165 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered January 8, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and purportedly waived his right to appeal. Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to 4V2 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Initially, we find that defendant’s waiver of appeal was not valid. During the plea allocution, County Court failed to adequately explain the nature of the right to appeal or the consequences of waiving that right, and a written waiver executed by defendant is not included in the record before us (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; cf. People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]). As defendant’s understanding of the waiver is not “evident on the face of the record,” it is not valid (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256).
Defendant’s argument that the agreed-upon sentence is harsh or excessive is properly before us as a result (see id. at 255-256); nevertheless, we reject it. The record reflects that defendant’s guilty plea was accepted only after two psychiatrists conducted CPL article 730 examinations, concluding that he was not incapacitated. In agreeing to a sentence that greatly reduced defendant’s potential sentencing exposure under the indictment, County Court took into consideration his mental health and substance abuse problems (see People v Eggsware, 90 AD3d 1231, 1234 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 923 [2012]). Given defendant’s serious criminal history, we do not find that the sentence imposed constituted an abuse of discretion or that extraordinary circumstances are present so as to warrant a reduction in the sentence (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Crump, 107 AD3d 1046, 1047 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1014 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered May 2, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Three days prior to the commencement of trial of an indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and four additional charges, defendant was permitted to dispose of the entire indictment with a plea of guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The plea was to be entered with the express understanding that defendant would receive the minimum legally permissible sentence, a prison term of three years to life, and accepted only upon condition that defendant waive his right to appeal. Having entered the plea, made a waiver of his right to appeal and received the sentence provided for in the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, contending that County Court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as the resxilt of an allegedly illegal stop and search of his vehicle.
We agree with the People that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made and should be enforced (see, People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, 830, cert denied 423 US 873; People v Dixon, 210 AD2d 532, 533). In our view, County Court’s statement on the record that defendant was waiving all of his appeal rights except those constitutional issues that survive a waiver of a right to appeal under People v Seaberg (74 NY2d 1) neither preserved defendant’s right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion (see, CPL 710.70 [2]) nor gave defendant any reason to believe that he was not waiving such right (see, People v Williams, supra, at 830).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered September 16, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was arraigned on July 12, 2002 on three misdemeanor informations and six felony complaints arising from his alleged possession and sale of cocaine on three separate occasions during October 2001 in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County. Thereafter, he waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the pending charges and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2½ to 5 years in prison.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to make a statutory speedy trial motion to dismiss the charges based upon the more than six-month delay between the filing of the criminal complaints and his arraignment. Inasmuch as the claimed ineffectiveness is not alleged to have impeded the voluntariness of his plea, it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lane 1 AD3d 801, 803 [2003]; People v Bier, 307 AD2d 649, 650 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]). Even if it were not, defendant is precluded from raising it by his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Shaw, 306 AD2d 697, 698 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 645 [2003]; People v Camp, supra at 630). “Where, as here, no pretrial motion or motion to withdraw the plea or to vacate the conviction has been made to the trial court, this issue is properly raised through a CPL article 440 motion, not on direct appeal” (People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 632 [2003] [citations omitted]; see People v Hemingway, 306 AD2d 689, 690 [2003]).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Breslin, J.), rendered December 10, 2012 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of various drug-related charges against him, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Supreme Court thereafter sentenced defendant, in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, to six years in prison to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, based upon our review of the plea colloquy and in consideration of his counseled written waiver of appeal, defendant was adequately informed that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea such that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v O’Keefe, 133 AD3d 1034, 1034-1035 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1148 [2016]; People v Oginski, 123 AD3d 1303, 1303 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 970 [2015]). Further, given defendant’s valid appeal waiver, he is precluded from challenging his sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Griffin, 134 AD3d 1228, 1231 [2015]; People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered November 30, 2010, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, after a hearing.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement and in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, defendant, a citizen of Guyana with permanent resident status in the United States, pleaded guilty in 2005 to the reduced crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony. He was sentenced to the agreed-upon term of six months in jail and five years of probation. He did not appeal that judgment. In 2010, after removal (i.e., deportation) proceedings were commenced against him reportedly based upon this 2005 conviction and a 2002 drug-related misdemeanor, defendant — aided by counsel — moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his 2005 judgment of conviction. Defendant contended that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because his trial counsel had ineffectively represented him by misinforming him that he would not be subject to removal as a consequence of that guilty plea. After a hearing at which defendant and his trial counsel testified, County Court denied defendant’s motion. Defendant now appeals.
It is not disputed that as a resident alien, defendant’s conviction, upon his guilty plea, to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree rendered him subject to deporta tion (see 8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]; People v Reynoso, 88 AD3d 1162, 1163 [2011]; see also People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 954 [2012]; People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]). In Padilla v Kentucky (559 US —, — n 1, —, 130 S Ct 1473, 1477 n 1, 1483 [2010]), the United States Supreme Court held that federal immigration laws governing deportation of resident aliens convicted of drug-related offenses are clear and explicit, making removal “presumptively mandatory,” and that trial counsel’s representation is constitutionally deficient if he or she fails to accurately advise or misadvises a defendant, prior to entering a guilty plea, of the deportation consequences of that plea (see Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 686, 688 [1984]).
To meet his burden of proving that he was deprived of meaningful representation related to his guilty plea, defendant was required to establish both “that counsel’s performance was deficient” and “that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense” (id. at 687; see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 113-114). At the hearing, defendant testified that he had been concerned about and discussed with counsel the immigration consequences of a guilty plea to the drug sale offense in the plea offer. While defendant admitted being aware at the time of this plea that a felony drug-related conviction subjected him to removal, which he learned during a prior plea to a reduced drug-related misdemeanor, he testified that counsel advised bim not to worry regarding the immigration consequences of this plea because he was a “small fish” and federal authorities have “bigger fishes to fry.” Defendant claimed he would not have accepted the plea offer if he knew that it would result in his removal.
Counsel testified that, although he could not recall his specific conversations with defendant, he was aware that defendant was not a citizen in 2005 and his general practice, as relevant here, is to advise all noncitizens that deportation is a possible consequence of any drug-related conviction. He also testified that, in his experience, the likelihood of removal proceedings being pursued by federal authorities may be diminished when a plea is to a reduced lower level felony, as here, or is served in local jail rather than state prison, and he may have shared that opinion with defendant. In denying defendant’s motion, County Court expressly credited counsel’s testimony — which contradicted that of defendant — that he would not have told defendant that he would not be deported as a result of the subject guilty plea, and we accord great deference to that credibility assessment (see People v Bodah, 67 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 838 [2010]).
Because defendant was advised that removal was a possible consequence of his guilty plea, and was not misinformed to the contrary, he did not establish that counsel failed to fulfill his obligations on this issue or that his advice was deficient so as to satisfy the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US at —, 130 S Ct at 1482-1483; People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 114-115; People v Diallo, 88 AD3d 1152, 1152-1153 [2011]). The fact that counsel, in advising defendant to accept the favorable plea deal, may have expressed his experience-based assessment of the likelihood that removal proceedings might or might not be initiated depending upon different factors was not misleading and did not undermine counsel’s accurate preplea advisement to defendant that the drug sale plea offer is a removable offense for a noncitizen (see People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d at 1029). As defendant did not establish that he was deprived of meaningful representation or any other ground to vacate the judgment of conviction, County Court properly denied his CPL 440.10 motion.

. Those papers are not in the record on appeal.
. We need not decide whether Padilla is to be applied retroactively to defendant’s collateral attack premised upon counsel’s alleged affirmative misadvice (see People v Pepper, 53 NY2d 213, 220-221 [1981], cert denied 454 US 967 [1981]). At the time of defendant’s 2005 plea, the New York Court of Appeals had established that counsel’s affirmative misrepresentation to a noncitizen regarding the deportation consequences of a contemplated guilty plea constituted deficient performance as required to establish the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109 [2003]).",,1025,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 9, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a superior court information with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree based upon his possession of cocaine with intent to sell in a controlled buy operation. He pleaded guilty as charged, was sentenced to five years of probation and was ordered to forfeit the vehicle that was seized at the time of his arrest. Subsequently, he was charged in an amended indictment with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree after police recovered additional drugs from his vehicle. Following County Court’s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, defendant admitted that he had possessed cocaine in an amount exceeding one half of an ounce, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and waived his right to appeal as part of the negotiated plea agreement. He was then sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison and now appeals.
Initially, defendant waived his constitutional double jeopardy claim by his express waiver of the right to appeal, which “evidence [d] the understanding that, by taking the plea, [he] knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently gave up the right to appeal from all waivable aspects of the case” (People v Muniz, 91 NY2d 570, 575 [1998]; see People v Almonte [Beano], 288 AD2d 632, 633 [2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 726, 727 [2002]). Even assuming that defendant’s claim is properly before us, the prohibition against double jeopardy “do[es] not prevent successive prosecution of two offenses arising out of the same transaction where, as here, ‘each of the offenses contains an element which the other does not’ ” (Matter of Kelly v Bruhn, 3 AD3d 783, 784 [2004], lv dismissed 2 NY3d 793 [2004], quoting People v Wood, 95 NY2d 509, 513 [2000]). While defendant’s previous conviction on his guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree required proof that he intended to sell the drugs (see Penal Law § 220.06 [1]), the instant charge required proof that the aggregate weight of the drugs are one half of an ounce or more (see Penal Law § 220.16 [12]). Accordingly, double jeopardy posed no constitutional bar to defendant’s current prosecution (see People v Lebron, 305 AD2d 799, 801 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 583 [2003]; People v Lanahan, 276 AD2d 906, 907-908 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 965 [2000]). Given defendant’s voluntary, knowing and intelligent plea and his valid waiver of the right to appeal, we decline to review his remaining challenge to the severity of the agreed-upon sentence (see People v Keebler, 15 AD3d 724, 727-728 [2005]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered May 2, 1994, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Shortly before the commencement of a trial on an indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and two other counts, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment. The plea was entered with the express understanding that defendant would receive the shortest legally permissible sentence, a prison term of six years to life, and accepted only upon condition that defendant waive her right to appeal. Having been sentenced pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, contending that County Court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle in which she was a passenger.
The record provides no basis for a finding that defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal was not knowingly and intelligently made (see, People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958) and we are not persuaded that a defendant’s right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress tangible evidence will survive a valid waiver of appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7; People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, cert denied 423 US 873; People v Scott, supra). Under the circumstances, the waiver of defendant’s right to appeal will be enforced.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered July 14, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
In May 2003, defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, both class D felonies. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the charges and waived his right to appeal. In exchange, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to prison terms of 2 to 4 years on the drug charge and 3 to 6 years on the weapons charge, to run consecutively, and was also ordered to pay restitution of $240 and a forfeiture of $270. The basis for sentencing defendant as a second felony offender was his conviction on September 4, 1991 of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, which he admitted. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea bargain and now appeals.
Defendant challenges the legality of the sentence, arguing that his 1991 conviction did not provide a valid basis for his classification as a second felony offender because it occurred more than 10 years prior to the crimes at issue and there are no applicable tolling periods (see Penal Law § 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]; People v Stanley, 12 AD3d 467 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 891 [2005]). Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant’s adjudication as a second felony offender resulted in a greater sentence than would have otherwise been imposed and, consequently, implicated his right to be sentenced according to law, it is not subject to the preservation requirement (see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52 [2000]; People v Stanley, supra at 467). Turning to the merits, it is clear from the predicate felony statement that the prior crime occurred outside the 10-year window and the People concede that there are no applicable tolling periods. In view of this, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing (see People v Wilsey, 301 AD2d 755, 756 [2003]). Given our disposition, we need not address defendant’s remaining claim.

Following an undercover drug investigation undertaken by the Kingston Police Department during the course of which defendant sold crack cocaine on two separate occasions to an undercover police investigator, defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following jury selection for defendant’s trial on these charges, defendant withdrew his previously entered plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. At the time of the plea, County Court made it clear that although a sentence of 2 to 6 years was discussed, the plea was unconditional and there was no commitment as to the sentence that would ultimately be imposed. Thereafter, defense counsel requested two adjournments and ultimately a bench warrant was issued for defendant’s arrest. Ultimately, after defendant could not be located, County Court made a finding that defendant’s absence was deliberate and proceeded to sentence defendant in absentia to the harshest allowable sentence of SUs to 25 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Although defendant maintains that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion. County Court specifically warned defendant at his plea allocution that if he failed to appear for the scheduled sentencing date and his failure was unexcused, the court would definitely impose the harshest sentence and would do so in defendant’s absence. Thus, defendant’s failure to appear despite this specific warning justified the imposition of the more severe sentence (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718).
Turning to the issues raised by defendant in his pro se brief, we are similarly unpersuaded that grounds for reversal have been presented. Defendant’s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the Grand Jury evidence was forfeited by his guilty plea (see, People v Freeman, 198 AD2d 725, lv denied 83 NY2d 804) and, in any event, the claim lacks merit. Finally, it was not improper for County Court to sentence defendant in absentia given the warnings administered and the circumstances presented (see, People v Santiago, 190 AD2d 700, lv denied 81 NY2d 976).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered April 24, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, the record clearly establishes that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal as part of a negotiated plea bargain and he fully understood the consequences of that waiver (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039, 1041). We do note, however, that County Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to a term of imprisonment of 3½ to 10½ years.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered August 16, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In March 2005, defendant was indicted on three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree based upon his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer during a three-month period ending in December 2004. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and, in accordance with defendant’s plea agreement, two concurrent prison terms of six years to life were to be imposed. At sentenc ing, however, County Court instead imposed two concurrent prison terms of six years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, inasmuch as he has failed to move either to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has not preserved his claim that his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Lopez, 52 AD3d 852, 853 [2008]; People v Jennings, 46 AD3d 1029, 1029 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 766 [2008]). Were we to consider his claim, we would conclude that his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Clapper, 51 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2008]). The plea allocution clearly indicates that defendant was advised by County Court that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, that the People had the obligation to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury’s verdict had to be unanimous. Defendant indicated that he understood those rights and acknowledged that he had not been forced, threatened or coerced into giving up these rights. Defendant stated that he was satisfied with counsel and proceeded to allocute the facts that constituted the crime to which he pleaded guilty.
Nor was there was any confusion surrounding the sentence that would be imposed if, in fact, defendant pleaded guilty. While defendant requested that he be sentenced to concurrent six-year prison terms in accordance with the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (hereinafter DLRA), he was aware at the time that he entered his plea that the plea agreement called for the imposition of two concurrent sentences of six years to life (see People v La Porte, 31 AD3d 800, 801 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]; People v Gorham, 18 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2005]).
However, defendant’s sentence as imposed by County Court must be modified. Rather than imposing the agreed-upon sentence of six years to life, County Court found that defendant qualified to be sentenced under the DLRA and, based upon that finding, imposed two six-year prison terms. Inasmuch as the crimes for which defendant pleaded guilty were committed prior to the effective date of the DLRA—and the DLRA sentencing guidelines cannot be imposed retrospectively (see People v Utsey, 7 NY3d 398, 403 [2006]; People v Warren, 41 AD3d 745, 746 [2007])—County Court was required to sentence defendant as a second felony offender convicted of a class A-II felony to an indeterminate period of imprisonment with a maximum term of life imprisonment (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [a]) and a minimum term of no less than six years (see Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [a]). Consequently, the sentences as imposed by County Court were illegal and “by operation of law they cannot stand” (People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941, 941 [1995]; see People v Tubbs, 157 AD2d 915, 916 [1990], lv denied 76 NY2d 744 [1990]). Defendant’s sentence is therefore vacated and the matter is remitted for County Court to impose the agreed-upon indeterminate prison term. Defendant’s remaining contentions lack merit.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered January 10, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 to 7 years. Defendant appeals, contending that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was permitted to plead to a lesser crime than that with which he was originally charged and he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Williams, 238 AD2d 633, lv denied 90 NY2d 866). Furthermore, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence should not be disturbed (see, id.).

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 8, 2014, (1) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In 2009, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to five years of probation. While on probation, defendant was ar rested after allegedly selling cocaine to a confidential informant and agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, as charged in a superior court information, and to violating the terms of his probation. As part of the agreement, which purportedly included that he waive the right to appeal, defendant was to receive, as a second felony offender, an aggregate sentence of 4V2 years in prison, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant failed to appear at sentencing and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was arrested on the warrant six months later. He thereafter agreed to admit to violating a Parker admonishment in exchange for not being charged with bail jumping, with the understanding that he would now be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court thereafter revoked defendant’s probation and imposed the agreed-upon aggregate sentence. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we agree with defendant that he did not validly waive the right to appeal. County Court failed to distinguish “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]). Moreover, although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, County Court did not “ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver” (People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], Iv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], Iv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]).
Defendant also contends that his guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and violating his probation was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because County Court failed to inform him of the constitutional rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. Although this contention is unpreserved for our review, inasmuch as he failed to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Bond, 146 AD3d 1155, 1156 [2017]), we find that the error warrants reversal of the judgment in the interest of justice (see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1210 [2017]; People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]).
“While there is no mandatory catechism required of a pleading defendant, there must be an affirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his or her constitutional rights” (People v Lowe, 133 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]; see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]). During the plea allocution, County Court merely asked whether defendant understood “what the attorneys have told me about you waiving your rights and entering pleas of guilty to a felony, violation of probation and all of that stuff” and whether defendant had “[a]ny questions at all regarding you giving up your rights to a jury trial, your rights to presumption of innocence, your rights to a violation of probation hearing, anything like that.” County Court further failed to ascertain whether defendant had discussed with counsel the trial-related rights being waived by a guilty plea or its constitutional consequences. Rather, County Court simply inquired whether defendant “[had] the time, and did you talk to [counsel] regarding this case, the disposition, and anything else that is important to you, with respect to these charges” (see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1210; People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245). Additionally, County Court did not advise defendant of his rights or the consequences regarding an admission to violating probation (see People v Bryant, 262 AD2d 791, 791 [1999]), including that he understood that he was entitled to a hearing on the issue and that he was waiving that right (compare People v Crowell, 119 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2014], Iv denied 24 NY3d 1083 [2014]; People v Diaz, 26 AD3d 644, 645 [2006], Iv denied 7 NY3d 755 [2006]). “With no affirmative showing on the record that defendant understood and waived his constitutional rights when he entered the guilty plea, the plea was invalid and must be vacated” (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1210 [citations omitted]; see People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245-1246). Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed. In light of the foregoing, defendant’s remaining contentions are academic.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered December 11, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.
Upon remittal from this Court, County Court conducted a hearing to determine the proper amount of restitution defendant should be required to make as well as the manner of payment (see, 221 AD2d 779). At the hearing, testimony was taken from a representative of the St. Lawrence County Department of Social Services as to the excess amounts received by defendant in public assistance and food stamps; the total amount calculated as being owed was $6,132. Defendant also testified as to his monthly expenses. County Court determined that defendant owed the sum of $6,132 and ordered him to pay it at the rate of $75 per month, with credit for what he had already paid.
On appeal, relying on People v Turco (130 AD2d 785, lv denied 70 NY2d 755) and similar cases, defendant contends that County Court erred in not considering any efforts by the Department of Social Services to collect moneys from his girlfriend and that any sums collected from her should have been subtracted from his restitution. Significantly, however, defendant’s girlfriend was not a codefendant. In People v Turco (supra) the Court held that an official designated to receive restitution payments from codefendants in a criminal case is required to report amounts paid by other defendants so as to avoid ""duplicative or inequitable apportionment of restitution payments” among codefendants (see, id., at 787). Here, County Court properly refused to consider evidence with respect to any obligations of the girlfriend or payments by her because she was not before the court and, unlike a codefendant, was not legally responsible for paying restitution. As for the amount of restitution ordered, the issue was explored at length at the hearing, as was the question of defendant’s ability to pay. On the record before us, it cannot be said that the amount or the method of payment was improper or unfair (see, People v Hendrickson, 227 AD2d 801).

"Spain, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Czajka, J.), rendered August 28, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant entered a plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of an 11-count indictment. At the plea colloquy defendant admitted that on February 5, 1998 he possessed heroin and cocaine weighing in excess of two ounces. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to four years to life in prison. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s primary contention is that count one of the indictment—the charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty—was duplicitous and/or jurisdictionally defective. That count alleged that on the date of his arrest, defendant “knowingly and unlawfully possessed one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing a narcotic drug, to wit, heroin and cocaine, and said preparations, compounds, mixtures and substances were of an aggregate weight of two ounces or more”. Defendant contends—as he did in a preplea motion to dismiss—that this count is defective because it specifies that he possessed more than one type of a controlled substance, i.e., heroin and cocaine, and thus it illegally aggregated the weight of two narcotic substances to satisfy the weight requirement for this crime.
It is well settled that a defendant’s entry of a guilty plea constitutes a forfeiture of challenges to nonjurisdictional defects in an accusatory instrument while jurisdictional defects therein are not waived (see, People v George, 261 AD2d 711, 712-713, lv denied 93 NY2d 1018; see also, People v Beattie, 80 NY2d 840, 842; People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600). A duplicitous indictment is not jurisdictionally defective (see, People v Caban, 129 AD2d 721, lv denied 70 NY2d 644). Thus, by pleading guilty defendant has waived any challenge to count one as being duplicitous (see, People v Aiello, 153 AD2d 988, 990-991, lv denied 74 NY2d 946; see also, People v Beattie, supra; People v Levin, 57 NY2d 1008, 1009).
In contrast to a failure to effectively charge a defendant with the commission of a particular crime, which is a jurisdictional defect (see, People v Iannone, supra, at 600; People v George, supra; People v Aiello, supra), a contention that an indictment is duplicitous is essentially a claim that a count of an indictment “effectively charges him with the commission of more than one crime” (People v Caban, supra, at 721; see, CPL 200.30). Here, count one alleges every element of the crime charged—including the requisite possession of at least two ounces of a narcotic drug—and recites the precise Penal Law provision violated (see, Penal Law § 220.18 [1]; People v George, supra, at 713; People v Aiello, supra, at 990-991). As in People v Aiello (supra), “[t]he allegations are consistent with such possession of either cocaine or heroin, or both [and,] [t]hus, the pleading defect * * * is more one of duplicity than the failure to state a crime” (People v Aiello, supra, at 990). Defendant’s contention that there existed an insufficient quantity of either drug alone is premised upon extrinsic evidence contained in the State Police report and does not constitute a jurisdictional defect in count one of the indictment (see, People v Aiello, supra; see also, People v Motley, 119 AD2d 57, 58-59, affd 69 NY2d 870). Accordingly, as defendant’s contention on appeal does not raise a jurisdictional defect, he forfeited review of that issue by his guilty plea (see, People v Levin, 57 NY2d 1008, 1009, supra; People v Beattie, 80 NY2d 840, 842, supra; People v George, supra; People v Aiello, supra).
Defendant’s remaining contention is that the sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice from four years to life to the most lenient permissible sentence of three years to life, which minimum sentence the People had originally conditionally agreed to recommend in exchange for defendant’s guilty plea. The record reflects that at the time defendant pleaded guilty the People agreed to recommend a sentence of four years to life, which bargain the People upheld at sentencing. Defendant had been reminded by County Court that the People would no longer recommend the most lenient sentence of three years to life once the suppression hearing began, and defendant did not agree to plead guilty until after the hearing was underway. At sentencing County Court, which had not previously committed to any sentence, imposed the agreed-upon sentence of four years to life. Accordingly, we perceive no basis in this record upon which to disturb the imposition of the agreed-upon, less than maximum sentence (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).

Appeal from an order of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), entered August 28, 2014, which denied defendant’s motion for resentencing pursuant to CPL 440.46.
In 2001, defendant was convicted of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender to four prison terms of 12V2 to 25 years on the criminal sale and third-degree criminal possession convictions and a prison term of 7V2 to 15 years on the fourth-degree criminal possession conviction, all sentences to run concurrently. His conviction was later affirmed on appeal (People v Lee, 303 AD2d 839 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 622 [2003]).
In 2009, defendant made a pro se motion pursuant to CPL 440.46 to be resentenced on these crimes. County Court denied the motion on the ground that a prior violent felony conviction rendered him ineligible for resentencing. This Court reversed and remitted the matter to County Court to reconsider defendant’s motion in light of the relevant factors (People v Lee, 110 AD3d 1346 [2013]). On remittal, County Court again denied defendant’s motion, finding that he was not entitled to resentencing on the fourth-degree criminal possession conviction, a class C felony, because the provisions of CPL 440.46 applied only to class B felonies. Nevertheless, the court proceeded to review defendant’s criminal history, the circumstances underlying his conviction, his prison disciplinary record and his accomplishments while in prison, and concluded that substantial justice would not be served by resentencing him. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, the People concede, and we agree, that County Court erred in finding that defendant was ineligible to be resentenced on the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree because it is a class C felony. The statute clearly provides for resentencing on a class C felony where, as here, the original sentence was imposed at the same time as the sentences on the class B felonies (see CPL 440.46 [2]). Accordingly, defendant was eligible to be resentenced on this crime.
Notwithstanding this error, County Court proceeded to consider the merits of defendant’s motion. Under CPL 440.46, an eligible defendant shall be resentenced “unless ‘substantial justice dictates that the application should be denied’ ” (People v Davis, 128 AD3d 1269, 1269 [2015], quoting L 2004, ch 738, § 23; see People v Carpenter, 86 AD3d 721, 721 [2011]). Here, County Court considered defendant’s lengthy criminal history, including a conviction for escape in the first degree arising from his escape from jail in 2001, his prison disciplinary record and his failure to take responsibility for his crimes. The court also took into account defendant’s accomplishments while in prison, but concluded that substantial justice would not be served by resentencing in light of the other factors. Under the circumstances presented, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion (see People v Davis, 128 AD3d at 1270; People v Allen, 118 AD3d 1048, 1049 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 958 [2014]; People v Buckery, 98 AD3d 1191 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1009 [2013]). We have considered the contentions raised in defendant’s pro se brief and find them to be unavailing.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered August 26, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged by felony complaint, and later by indictment, with attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. After County Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He now appeals, asserting that his statutory and constitutional speedy trial rights were denied.
We affirm. Defendant, by pleading guilty, waived his right to appellate review of his argument regarding his CPL 30.30 speedy trial right (see People v Cintron, 7 AD3d 827, 828 [2004]). Although defendant’s claim of denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial survives his guilty plea, considering the factors set forth in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442, 445 [1975]), defendant has not demonstrated that this right was violated (see People v Cintron, supra at 828). Even accepting defendant’s timeline, he committed a serious crime of selling almost an ounce of cocaine, the delay was not extensive, he was released on bail two days after his arrest and no prejudice has been demonstrated.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered December 1, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal contempt in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal contempt in the second degree in full satisfaction of four accusatory instruments, including indictment Nos. 1-83-2014 and 1-80-2014, and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to consecutive sentences of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, on the criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal sale of a controlled substance convictions, and ordered restitution in the amount of $300 for each conviction. The court also sentenced defendant to one year in jail for the criminal contempt conviction. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant contends that, by imposing the one-year sentence on the criminal contempt conviction, County Court improperly enhanced his sentence without offering him an opportunity to withdraw his plea. While this issue survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to object on this ground at sentencing or move to withdraw his plea on this basis (see People v Raleigh, 121 AD3d 1412, 1413 [2014]; People v DePalma, 99 AD3d 1116, 1116-1117 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1010 [2013]).
Defendant also contends that County Court improperly ordered $300 in restitution on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 1-80-2014. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the People requested and defendant agreed to pay $300 in restitution on his conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in satisfaction of indictment No. 1-83-2014, which represented funds used in a controlled buy. Although there was no similar agreement regarding the guilty plea to the criminal possession charge in satisfaction of indictment No. 1-80-2014, the People requested the restitution at sentencing, without offering any evidence in support of restitution under this charge. Although defendant’s challenge to the restitution ordered for the criminal possession conviction is unpreserved due to his failure to request a hearing or object at the time of sentencing (see People v Vasavada, 93 AD3d 893, 894 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 978 [2012]; People v Drayton, 79 AD3d 1529, 1530 [2010]), we find it appropriate to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment is modified by reversing the sentence only insofar as it directs defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $300 pursuant to his conviction under indictment No. 1-80-2014 and remit the matter for the sole purpose of a restitution hearing or a redetermination of restitution (see People v Morehouse, 140 AD3d 1202, 1204 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 934 [2016]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 970 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 1153 [2016]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered July 12, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In March 1997, defendant was charged in a superior court information with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Following plea negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime charged and waived his right to appeal. In exchange, defendant was to receive a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years’ probation. Approximately 2V2 years after defendant failed to appear for sentencing, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. In May 2000, defendant was returned to court. County Court denied his oral motion to vacate his plea on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over him and thereafter sentenced him to one year in jail. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, as well as by his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]). Contrary to defendant’s assertion, his oral motion to withdraw his plea preserves only the ground stated as the basis for the motion (see People v Spulka, 285 AD2d 840, 840 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 643 [2001]). Inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt, negated an essential element of the crime or cast significant doubt on his guilt, the exception to the preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Hermance, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]). Because defendant failed to appear for sentencing, we reject his argument that County Court lacked jurisdiction to impose sentence (see Matter of Root v Kapelman, 67 AD2d 131, 137 [1979], lv denied 47 NY2d 706 [1979]). Defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence will not be reviewed given his knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 935 [2004]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered December 8, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 15 years to life. Defendant now appeals, contending that his guilty plea was involuntarily obtained.
We affirm. Initially, in view of defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the validity of his plea 1ms not been preserved for our review (see, People v Santos, 247 AD2d 651, lv denied 92 NY2d 905). In any event, were we to consider the merits, our review of the record discloses that defendant’s plea was entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. County Court engaged in an extensive colloquy with defendant explaining the consequences of pleading guilty including the rights relinquished thereby (see, People v Toledo, 243 AD2d 925). Defendant related that he was pleading guilty voluntarily and without coercion, that he was afforded an adequate opportunity to discuss the matter with his counsel and fully understood the ramifications of his plea and the sentencing options available to the court (see, People v Victor, 262 AD2d 872; People v Johnson, 243 AD2d 997, lv denied 91 NY2d 927). Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will not be disturbed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered March 28, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class A-III felony. Defendant was charged with selling three bags of heroin to an undercover police officer. Upon his conviction after trial, he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum term of four years and a maximum term of his natural life (Penal Law, § 70.00, subds 2, 3). On this appeal, defendant questions the constitutionality of the sentencing provision of the Penal Law as it applies to him for he was barely 16 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime and a first felony offender (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 119). He also argues that the summation of the Assistant District Attorney exceeded the bounds of fair comment and was prejudicial. We reject both contentions. As to the constitutional issue, we find People v Broadie (supra) decisive and controlling. Nor do we regard the comments of the prosecutor as constituting anything other than a response to issues raised by the defendant in his own summation. Even if they could be considered error, it was indeed harmless in view of the proof offered by the People (People v Crimmins, 38 NY2d 407). Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered December 17, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In September 1999, defendant was indicted on two counts each of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, arising out of his alleged possession and sale of crack cocaine in the City of Hudson, Columbia County. At the time of the indictment, defendant was on parole from a 1995 conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant accepted a plea bargain pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, waiving his right to appeal. In exchange, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to two concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 10 to 20 years.
Defendant appeals, seeking modification of the sentences imposed by County Court on the ground that they are harsh and excessive. We disagree. The sentences were well within the permissible statutory range and no extraordinary circumstances exist that would warrant modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Daniels, 281 AD2d 651; People v Squire, 273 AD2d 706, 707). In sentencing defendant, County Court was mindful of his extensive criminal record that includes two prior convictions for selling a controlled substance. We conclude that there was no abuse of judicial discretion in imposing these sentences and, accordingly, we decline to disturb them (see, People v Graves, 251 AD2d 746, 747; People v Torres, 206 AD2d 579, 580, lv denied 84 NY2d 911).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered January 17, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.
Defendant was indicted on August 25, 1998 for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a class A misdemeanor. At his arraignment on August 27,. 1998, defendant, through his then attorney, acknowledged receiving a copy of the indictment and entered a plea of not guilty. On September 9, 1998 defendant pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment as part of a plea bargain that included an agreement by defendant to plead guilty to a superior court information (hereinafter SCI) charging him with criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, a class E. felony, in return for sentences of 1 to 3 years for the felony charges and 1 year for the misdemeanor charge, all to run concurrently. Defendant also agreed to cooperate with the authorities in a “debriefing” and the District Attorney agreed to dismiss all misdemeanors pending in the local courts of Columbia County as part of the plea bargain.
On October 14, 1998, defendant pleaded guilty to the SCI and expected to be sentenced according to the terms of the plea bargain on all charges to the agreed-upon sentence. Upon reviewing the presentence report, however, County Court noted a prior felony conviction which prevented it from imposing the recommended sentence. Sentencing was adjourned and there after defense counsel obtained an order to show cause seeking specific performance of the plea bargain or, in the alternative, withdrawal of defendant’s guilty plea and appointment of new defense counsel because of a potential conflict of interest. On November 18, 1998 County Court appointed new defense counsel and granted defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The case was then scheduled for trial. On January 7, 1999, after pretrial hearings were concluded, defendant again pleaded guilty to the charges set forth in the indictment and the SCI in exchange for the People’s recommendation for the minimum allowable indeterminate sentence (4V2 to 9 years) on the class B felony to run concurrently with an indeterminate sentence (2 to 4 years) on the class E felony and a 1-year definite sentence on the class A misdemeanor. The People agreed to forego prosecution of a second sale of narcotics charge and misdemeanor charges pending in Hudson City Court and defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. County Court sentenced defendant according to the terms of his plea bargain and he now appeals.
Defendant contends that County Court did not properly inform him of the charges against him at his arraignment on August 27, 1998 in violation of CPL 210.15 (1) and, therefore, never acquired jurisdiction over him. Defendant’s contention is without merit. The record reveals that defendant was arraigned on a valid accusatory instrument (see, People v Ford, 62 NY2d 275), was represented by counsel (see, CPL 210.15 [2]), was provided with a copy of the indictment (see, CPL 210.15 [1]) and waived a reading of the indictment prior to pleading not guilty to the charges. We find that County Court properly arraigned defendant on the charges in the indictment and obtained jurisdiction over his person. There is no indication in this record that any right of defendant, constitutional or statutory, was violated at his arraignment. Defendant makes no such jurisdictional argument with respect to the procedures leading to his plea of guilty to the charge set forth in the SCI.
Defendant next contends that this Court should reduce his sentence in the interest of justice. Defendant’s contention that his sentence is unfair is not preserved for our review because of his knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Kwiatkowski, 263 AD2d 552, lv denied 93 NY2d 1021; People v Shaw, 261 AD2d 648). In any event, such argument is groundless. County Court imposed the minimum sentence allowable for a second felony class B conviction despite defendant’s extensive criminal history. County Court did not abuse its discretion nor are any extraordinary circumstances present to warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Marcano, 265 AD2d 673, lv dismissed 95 NY2d 800; People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, lv denied 93 NY2d 968).
Defendant’s remaining arguments have been considered and found to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Dwyer, Jr., J.), rendered September 28, 1988, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging her with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree — specifically, cocaine. The terms of the plea agreement called for a sentence of 2 Vi to IV2 years’ imprisonment. At sentencing, however, defense counsel implored County Court to consider imposing a more lenient sentence, emphasizing that the presentence report recommended a term of probation. The court declined the request stating, in substance, that it was bound by the terms of the plea agreement. Defendant was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain.
On this appeal, defendant urges that we reduce the sentence in the interest of justice since this is her first offense, she is the 21-year-old mother of three children and she is the victim of a cocaine addiction. Instead, however, we are required to vacate the sentence imposed due to County Court’s failure to exercise its independent discretion at sentencing (see, People v Graybosch, 139 AD2d 664; People v Montoya, 138 AD2d 528). It is fundamental that a court retains discretion to impose an appropriate sentence notwithstanding the terms of a plea agreement and must exercise that authority (see, People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302). As such, the case must be remitted to County Court for resentencing. Given the procedural posture of this case, should County Court deem a more lenient sentence appropriate, the People must be accorded an opportunity to withdraw their consent to the waiver of indictment (see, CPL 195.10 [1] [c]; cf., People v Farrar, supra, at 307-308).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered July 19, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On April 13, 1995, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with various drug-related crimes. At his arraignment on May 1, 1995, defendant entered a plea of not guilty and the People announced their, readiness to proceed to trial. Subsequently, at a conference before County Court on May 19, 1995, the matter was adjourned until June 15, 1995 to allow defendant time to consider a plea offer. Following defendant’s rejection of the plea offer, the matter was adjourned again until late July 1995 to give defense counsel time to make certain pretrial motions. On August 10, 1995, County Court referred the matter to a Judicial Hearing Officer (hereinafter JHO) to conduct all pretrial hearings.
Following various adjournments, the hearings were conducted on December 12, 1995. The JHO subsequently rendered a recommendation which was adopted by County Court in April 1996. Although trial was scheduled for April 24, 1996, it was adjourned at defense counsel’s request until June 3, 1996. Before the matter proceeded, however, defense counsel made a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that defendant had been denied his right to a speedy trial. County Court denied the motion and rendered a judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree upon defendant’s subsequent plea of guilty. In July 1996, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison. He now appeals his conviction.
Defendant contends that the more than one-year delay between his indictment and sentencing deprived him of his statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial. Based upon the circumstances attending the delays in this case, we find defendant’s claims unavailing. Notably, all of the delay occurred after the People announced their readiness to proceed to trial. “Postreadiness delay may be chargeable to the People [only] where the causes of the delay directly implicate the People’s ability to proceed with trial” (People v Beckett, 215 AD2d 930, 932; see, People v Cortes, 80 NY2d 201, 210; People v Dushain, 239 AD2d 151, 153). Significantly, where the delay is attributable to adjournments requested by the defense (see, People v Dushain, supra, at 153), or occasioned by the necessity of pretrial proceedings (see, People v Reyes, 240 AD2d 165, 166, lv denied 90 NY2d 942) or the demands of the court calendar (see, People v Giordano, 56 NY2d 524, 525; People v Washington, 238 AD2d 263, lv denied 90 NY2d 944), the delay is not chargeable to the People.
In this case, the initial delay between the People’s announcement of readiness and County Court’s assignment of the JHO was due to adjournments requested to allow defendant to consider a plea offer and his counsel to file pretrial motions. The delay between the assignment of the JHO and County Court’s adoption of the JHO’s recommendation was a result of pretrial hearings. The adjournment of the April 1996 trial date was done at defense counsel’s request. Absent proof in the record that the People were responsible for any significant amount of postreadiness delay in this case, we conclude that defendant was not deprived of his statutory right to a speedy trial. We further find no merit to defendant’s claim that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. Therefore, we decline to disturb the judgment of conviction.

Upon pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that his sentence is excessive and should be reduced in light of the fact that he had no prior criminal record. Although defendant did not receive the most lenient sentence allowed by statute (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [b]), he also did not receive the harshest sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]). Even more significant, defendant entered his plea knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, and one other charge was dropped as a result of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Feldstein, J.), rendered June 3, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant initially pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment charging more serious crimes in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 4 years’ imprisonment. While being held pending sentencing, however, defendant was involved in an incident at the Schenectady County Jail which resulted in his pleading guilty to the crime of assault in the third degree. Consequently, County Court indicated at sentencing that it was no longer willing to impose the sentence agreed to and gave defendant an opportunity to either withdraw his plea or accept a sentence of 2Vz to 5 years’ imprisonment. Defendant ultimately agreed to the increased sentence and now appeals, contending that County Court erred in failing to abide by the terms of the original plea agreement and that the sentence is harsh and excessive.
We affirm. A sentencing court retains its discretion to impose an appropriate sentence until the time of sentencing (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757; People v Walker, 187 AD2d 909; People v Wade, 153 AD2d 969). Defendant’s additional criminal activity while awaiting sentencing clearly provided County Court with sufficient reason to depart from the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v Wade, supra). Given that defendant does not allege that he detrimentally relied upon the original sentencing agreement and was offered and rejected the opportunity to withdraw his plea, we cannot find that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant (see, People v Schultz, supra). Nor can we find any reason to disturb the sentence imposed in light of defendant’s plea agreement, his prior criminal record and his conduct while awaiting sentencing (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered June 19, 1975, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sales of a controlled substance in the third degree, possession of stolen property and possession of a weapon. On May 16, 1975, he pleaded guilty to one count of sale of a controlled substance in full satisfaction of the four-count indictment. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one year to life, the minimum sentence available. This appeal ensued and defendant urges reversal on the grounds (1) that his plea of guilty was improperly received; (2) a hearing should have been conducted to determine whether he was entitled to be sentenced to probation; and (3) the first two counts of the indictment should be dismissed because the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under the statutes is unconstitutional. This latter issue has already been passed upon by our courts and the statutes held constitutional. (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). The remaining issues have been examined by us and found unpersuasive. The record reveals that the court carefully questioned the defendant about the facts and circumstances surrounding the count of the indictment to which defendant pleaded guilty. The record further reveals that the court fully advised defendant of his rights and he understood what he was doing when he entered his plea of guilty. Finally, the record clearly demonstrates that the court informed defendant prior to sentence that the minimum sentence would be imposed unless the District Attorney recommended special treatment pursuant to section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law.

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4Vi to 9 years. Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed. As a part of the plea bargain, the People agreed not to prosecute defendant on another charge.

Defendant was sentenced to six concurrent prison terms of 5 to 15 years upon his plea of guilty to six drug-related class B felony charges, contained in two indictments filed against him. He was also sentenced to one-year jail terms upon his plea of guilty to three class A misdemeanor drug charges and a jail term of six months to a class B misdemeanor drug charge. These sentences were to run concurrently with the 5 to 15-year sentences. Defendant now claims that the sentences were harsh and excessive. In rejecting this claim, we note that the class B felony sentences were imposed in accordance with the plea agreement and were well within the statutory parameters. As to the remaining sentences, with the exception of the sentence imposed for the class B misdemeanor crime, we find nothing in the record to warrant disturbing the disposition rendered by County Court. As to the class B misdemeanor crime, the People concede that defendant could not legally be sentenced to more than three months. Therefore, the sentence for this crime should not have been imposed. Because it was concurrent with the other sentences, however, we find no reason to vacate the sentence or remit the matter and instead reduce it to a jail term of three months.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered March 5, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, with County Court making no sentencing commitment. He was accepted into the drug treatment court program in August 2012 and, as such, was placed on interim probation supervision. Defendant was sanctioned for failing to comply with the provisions of the treatment contract, and further violated the terms of his interim probation on two occasions. The second of those probation violations, in January 2013, arose when he absconded from the halfway house where he was residing and failed to report to his probation officer. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years, to be followed by postrelease supervision of two years.
Defendant now appeals, arguing that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Considering defendant’s prior criminal history and poor conduct while on interim probation, as well as the fact that he could have received a much more substantial prison term, “we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice” (People v Miller, 113 AD3d 935, 935-936 [2014], lv denied 22 NY3d 1201 [2014]; see People v Aljerari, 109 AD3d 1049, 1050 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1038 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Bender, J.), rendered October 3, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts).
As the result of an undercover police investigation, defendant was charged in a 12-count indictment with various drug-related crimes. In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and four counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 to 12 years on each count. On appeal, defendant contends that (1) insufficient evidence was adduced at the Wade hearing to establish that the identification procedures were not tainted, (2) the possessory counts of the indictment should have been merged with the sales counts, (3) trial counsel was ineffective, and (4) the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Initially, the plea minutes disclose that County Court fully apprised defendant of the ramifications of his guilty plea, including the fact that it encompassed a waiver of his right to appeal his conviction. Defendant fully understood the court’s admonitions and entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to the subject crimes. The plea was entered prior to County Court rendering a decision in the Wade hearing. In view of this, as well as the fact that defendant neither moved to withdraw his plea nor vacate the judgment of conviction, we find that he has failed to preserve the identification issue and the merger issue for our review (see, People v Patterson, 208 AD2d 987; People v Brown, 156 AD2d 204; People v Quackenbush, 98 AD2d 875).
As to defendant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective, we find on the record before us that trial counsel provided defendant competent and meaningful representation, including securing him a favorable plea bargain. Therefore, we find this claim to be without merit (see, People v Santiago, 227 AD2d 657; People v Reid, 224 AD2d 728; People v Rodriquez, 221 AD2d 820, lv denied 87 NY2d 924). Finally, we find that the sentence imposed, which was less than that agreed to by the prosecution in the original plea bargain, was neither harsh nor excessive given the gravity of the crimes and defendant’s prior drug-related activities.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered October 1, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with various drug-related crimes arising from his possession of heroin in the City of Troy, Rensselaer County. He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges and waived his right to appeal. He was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a prison term of 3 to 9 years to run consecutive to a 2 to 6 year prison term imposed by the Albany County Court in connection with other charges.
On appeal, defendant does not challenge the legality of the sentence, but argues that it is excessive because it was made to run consecutive, instead of concurrent, to the sentence imposed by the Albany County Court. Defendant, however, is precluded from raising this claim inasmuch as it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]). Defendant’s claim that his counsel was ineffective is also encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal inasmuch as it does not bear on the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Bier, 307 AD2d 649, 650 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]; People v Watkins, 304 AD2d 987, 987-988 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 588 [2003]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered May 5, 1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
On September 21, 1982, a Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in both the third and fourth degrees, class B and C felonies, respectively. Following negotiations between the District Attorney, defendant and his counsel, the former moved to reduce the second count of the indictment to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class D felony, and urged that a plea thereto be accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. Prior to granting the motion and accepting the plea, County Court thoroughly instructed defendant as to his rights and options and advised defendant that if he pleaded to the reduced charge, he would receive a prison sentence no greater than one having as its minimum 2 Vs years and as its maximum 7 years. County Court further advised that the precise sentence would have to await its examination of the presentence report and consideration of counsel’s remarks at sentencing. After consultation with his attorney, defendant expressed his desire to plead guilty. The motion of the District Attorney was granted and defendant’s plea to the reduced charge was accepted. Later, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 2 té to 7 years.
Defendant now appeals upon the sole ground that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. We first observe that CPL 450.10, to the extent that it impaired an appeal as of right, has been found to be violative of the NY Constitution (People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264) and, accordingly, we turn to the merits.
Prefatorily, the sentence imposed was within permissible limits (Penal Law § 220.09 [1]; §§ 110.00, 70.00 [2] [d]). That leniency was extended is clearly demonstrated by the grant of the motion to reduce the charge and by acceptance of the plea to the reduced charge in full satisfaction of the indictment (see, People v Bass, 92 AD2d 1062). Any and all commitments to defendant were fully complied with. Given these circumstances, defendant’s unenviable record and the quantity of heroin involved, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion, and no extraordinary circumstances warranting our interference with the sentence have been demonstrated (see, People v Whiting, 89 AD2d 694; People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered July 11, 2002, convicting defendant following a nonjury trial of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. He waived his right to a jury trial, was found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2 to 4 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
Defendant asserts that County Court improperly sentenced him as a second felony offender based upon his February 1999 conviction of robbery in the second degree. The record establishes that defendant was 16 years old at the time he committed this crime and that he served lVs to 4 years in a facility operated by the State Division for Youth. There is no indication that he was adjudicated a youthful offender. While “[a] youthful offender adjudication is not a judgment of conviction for a crime or any other offense” (CPL 720.35 [1]) and, therefore, may not be used to establish second felony offender status for purposes of sentencing (see People v Adams, 281 AD2d 707, 708 [2001]), we cannot conclude on the record before us that defendant was adjudicated a youthful offender with respect to the prior robbery conviction. Consequently, the sentence was not illegal. Defendant’s remaining arguments have been considered and are lacking in merit.

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that his sentence of 4 Vi to 9 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed. In addition, as a part of the plea arrangement various other pending charges were dropped. Given these circumstances, and the fact that the sentence was the most lenient sentence possible under the terms of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Gray, 131 AD2d 590).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered July 16, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged in a superior court information with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree after he was found in possession of 17 bags of cocaine. Defendant executed a written waiver of indictment and agreed to plead guilty as charged in exchange for which defendant was promised a prison term of no more than lVs to 4 years. Defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant at length of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and the consequences of a guilty plea and defendant replied that he understood. Defendant stated that he was guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, but denied knowing that it was cocaine that he had possessed. At this point, the proceeding was adjourned so that de fendant could confer with his attorney. Five days later, the plea proceeding resumed and defendant indicated that he had sufficient time to consult with his attorney and wanted to plead guilty and that no one was forcing him to do so. Defendant wás sworn and answered the court’s questions, admitted that he knew he possessed the requisite amount of cocaine, and signed a written appeal waiver. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to 1 to 3 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal and is also unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rogers, 15 AD3d 682 [2005]; People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]). Defendant made no statements during the final plea colloquy that negated an essential element of the crime or cast doubt upon his guilt and his responses to County Court’s questions established the elements of the crime; therefore, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]; People v Kelly, supra at 789; see also People v Goodell, 13 AD3d 816, 817 [2004], lv denied 4 NY2d 831 [2005]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]).
Next, to the extent that defendant’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel implicate the voluntariness of his plea, they survive the waiver of appeal (see People v Cabezas, 307 AD2d 594, 595 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]), but are likewise unpreserved and also belied by the record (see id. at 595; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]). The record does not support defendant’s assertion that he was denied meaningful representation by counsel’s failure to further investigate or pursue defenses, and instead evidences a favorable plea bargain (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Finally, defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence is barred by his voluntary waiver of his right to appeal and we find no basis on this record to conclude that said waiver should not be honored (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Lewis, J.), rendered November 16, 1990, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of conspiracy in the fourth degree.
Based upon information obtained from telephone conversations recorded by eavesdropping surveillance, defendant was indicted, along with several other alleged coconspirators, for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree. Following County Court’s denial of a motion to suppress all evidence secured as a result of the recorded telephone conversations, defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the counts against her. Under defendant’s plea agreement, she expressly reserved the right to challenge County Court’s denial of her suppression motion. Defendant was sentenced to a five-year term of probation and this appeal ensued.
There should be an affirmance. Initially, we note that defendant’s actual receipt of the CPL 700.50 (3) notice which was served upon her counsel satisfied the statutory requirement of service of the notice upon her (see, People v Weir, 177 AD2d 811; People v Baker, 174 AD2d 815, 817, Iv denied 78 NY2d 920). Nor do we agree with the contention that suppression was required because the statutory notice was not served within ""[90] days after termination of [the] eavesdropping * * * warrant, or expiration of an extension order” (CPL 700.50 [3]). Although the People concede that defendant’s attorney was not served with the notice until February 6, 1989, approximately two weeks following the expiration of the 90-day period, in the absence of a showing of prejudice as a result of the late notice, suppression of the wiretap evidence was properly denied (see, United States v Fury, 554 F2d 522, 527-529, cert denied sub nom. Quinn v United States 433 US 910, 436 US 931; People v Madori, 153 AD2d 287, 295-299). The general notification provision of CPL 700.50 (3) merely affords an ""opportunity to find out who has been poking into your private life and why and with what results” and ""is to be distinguished from CPL 700.70 which adds another specific notification requirement without which evidence secured by an eavesdrop may not be used as evidence” (Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 700.50, at 505; see, People v Madori, supra, at 298-299).

Defendant contends that he did not effectively waive his right to appeal his sentence and that his sentence of IVs to 4 years’ imprisonment is harsh and excessive. We find that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing and voluntary. Such a waiver includes a waiver of the right to challenge the sentence imposed particularly where, as here, the particular sentence to be imposed is set forth on the record as part of the plea agreement (see, People v Burk, 181 AD2d 74, 81, lv denied 80 NY2d 927; People v Colantonio, 144 AD2d 730, lv denied 73 NY2d 890; see also, People v Dews, 169 AD2d 886, lv denied 77 NY2d 905). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that there is no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court given that defendant pleaded guilty to a class E felony knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed as a part of a negotiated plea after having initially been charged with commission of a class B felony (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, Jr., J.), rendered July 2, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a five-count indictment. The terms of the plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to a determinate prison sentence of as few as two and as many as nine years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, depending upon his level of cooperation with the authorities and compliance with the terms of his release between the plea and sentencing date. A recommendation of participation in a shock incarceration or comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program was also contemplated by the plea agreement. Defendant was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision, with a recommendation for the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant contends that County Court should have considered him for youthful offender status and that counsel’s failure to pursue youthful offender treatment at sentencing rendered his assistance ineffective. It is clear from the record that at the time defendant entered into the negotiated plea agreement, he was aware that it did not include youthful offender treatment. Additionally, the presentence investigation report indicated that defendant would potentially be a candidate for youthful offender treatment but made no recommendation in that respect. Defendant subsequently waived his right to be considered for youthful offender treatment by failing to make a request for such consideration (see People v Wise, 29 AD3d 1216, 1217 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 852 [2006]; People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]; People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810, 811-812 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 675 [2002]). Under such circumstances, County Court was not required to address the issue at sentencing (see People v Hopper, 39 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2007]).
Because defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel “does not impact on the voluntariness of his plea, it is not properly before us due to his [valid] waiver of appeal” (People v Wise, 29 AD3d at 1216; see People v Howard, 1 AD3d at 719).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered August 28, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following an investigation by the Attorney General’s Statewide Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and 33 others were charged in a 226-count indictment with conspiracy and other crimes related to the distribution of cocaine in several counties in this state. Pursuant to a plea agreement that required his cooperation with the investigation and satisfied all 21 felony counts against him in the indictment, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under count 92 and waived his right to appeal. Consistent with County Court’s promise that the sentence would be capped at seven years with three years of postrelease supervision, the court imposed a prison sentence of 6V2 years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, defendant’s argument that his waiver of appeal was not knowing, voluntary or intelligent is contradicted by the record, which reflects that County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the trial rights automatically extinguished by the guilty plea, and confirmed that defendant understood the waiver, had voluntarily agreed to it, and had read and signed a written waiver of appeal after discussing it with counsel (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Martinez, 130 AD3d 1087, 1088 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]). While defendant’s challenge to his guilty plea as involuntary survives his waiver of appeal, it was not preserved for our review given the absence of any evidence that he raised this claim in an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Hudson, 130 AD3d 1320, 1320 [2015]; People v Dozier, 115 AD3d 1001, 1001 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1083 [2014]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was not triggered, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or that called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 364 [2013]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). In any event, were we to consider this claim, we would find that it is unsupported by the record.
Defendant’s allegations regarding what counsel advised him or investigated are outside the record on appeal and, as such, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion to vacate (see People v Trimm, 129 AD3d 1215, 1216 [2015]). Finally, defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed, which was below the promised cap, was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Estrada, 102 AD3d 1064, 1065 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered November 14, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced, in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. On this appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of his plea allocution and asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, neither contention is preserved for our review (see People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Green, 17 AD3d 780, 781 [2005]). Furthermore, and contrary to defendant’s assertion here, “his factual recitation during the plea colloquy did not negate an essential element of the crime or cast significant doubt as to his guilt and, therefore, the exception to the preservation rule is not applicable” (People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]).
Moreover, were we to consider defendant’s arguments, we would find them to be without merit. A police search of the apartment that defendant was in at the time of his arrest revealed over two grams of cocaine, two digital scales for weighing and measuring cocaine, multiple glassine envelopes used for packaging cocaine and a large quantity of cash. Although defendant, claiming to be a mere visitor on the premises, initially denied involvement, he ultimately admitted, during his plea colloquy, to possession of the narcotics for his “future use and control.” A review of that same colloquy, meanwhile, underscores defendant’s familiarity with the criminal justice system, as he repeatedly attempted to negotiate for a lesser sentence while questioning County Court regarding the possibility of confinement in a drug rehabilitation facility as opposed to state prison. The record is clear, nevertheless, that County Court fully apprised defendant of his rights and of the consequences of his plea prior to accepting it and that the plea was voluntarily entered (see People v Mitchetti, 13 AD 3d 673, 674 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 766 [2005]).
Defendant’s contention regarding the effectiveness of his counsel, who negotiated an advantageous plea agreement on his behalf, is similarly unpersuasive (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 977 [2006]).

"Crew III, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered October 13, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree stemming from a cocaine sale in the Town of Union, Broome County. Defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge in satisfaction of the instant indictment, other outstanding charges and a possible perjury charge arising from his grand jury testimony and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of six years to be followed by a D/a-year period of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we find no merit to defendant’s contention that his plea was fatally “vague and insufficient” because his plea made out both the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law § 220.39 [1])—the charge to which he was entering his guilty plea—and the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (see Penal Law § 220.31). Simply put, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree is a lesser included offense of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Baxton, 302 AD2d 401, 402 [2003], lv denied 99 NY2d 652 [2003]) and, by definition, “it is impossible to commit [the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree] without concomitantly committing, by the same conduct, [the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree]” (CPL 1.20 [37]; see People v Glover, 57 NY2d 61, 63-64 [1982]). Consequently, defendant’s plea to the greater charge necessarily satisfied the elements of the lesser charge, and his claim that this requires vacatur is patently meritless. In his plea allocution, defendant clearly and unequivocally admitted to knowingly selling a narcotic drug—cocaine—and, as such, we decline to disturb his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Next, inasmuch as he has not moved to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant’s contention that he was coerced into pleading guilty is unpreserved for our review (see People v Martinez, 40 AD3d 1309, 1310 [2007]; People v Harris, 308 AD2d 659, 659-660 [2003]). In any event, defendant’s argument is without merit. Defendant asserts that he was coerced into pleading guilty because the People were contemplating bringing a perjury charge against him based upon his grand jury testimony if he did not accept the plea. First, we note that the record demonstrates that it was defendant, not the People, who raised this issue when he declared that he “want[ed] to make sure that any uncharged criminal activity . . . will be wrapped up in satisfaction of this guilty plea,” and that defendant also stated that he was not forced or pressured “in any way” into pleading guilty. Even so, the fact that the People’s promise to refrain from further prosecution may have induced defendant to plead guilty did not, under the circumstances, “render defendant’s acceptance of the plea involuntary by reason of duress or coercion” (People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 770 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 919 [1996]; see People v France [Jenkins], 241 AD2d 525 [1997], lvs denied 91 NY2d 873, 875 [1997]; People v Winchenbaugh, 120 AD2d 811, 813 [1986]; see also People v Anderson [Anderson-Fialkow], 270 AD2d 509, 510 [2000], lvs denied 95 NY2d 792, 793 [2000]; People v Brown, 239 AJD2d 784, 784-785 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 870 [1997]).
Finally, the record belies defendant’s claim that his plea was involuntary based upon the fact that he may have been experiencing pain at the time of his plea due to his ocular disability. Upon defendant’s declaration that he was in pain, County Court inquired further to insure that he understood the nature of his plea and its consequences, and we discern no basis upon which to disturb it (see People v Harris, 308 AD2d at 660; People v McCann, 289 AD2d 703, 703-704 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered September 17, 2013, convicting defendant upon her guilty plea of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Following an investigation by the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and 33 others were charged in a 226-count indictment with conspiracy and other crimes stemming from the distribution of cocaine in multiple counties in New York. Defendant was also separately charged in a superior court information with grand larceny in the third degree, and the Albany County District Attorney filed a petition alleging that she had violated probation. The Attorney General and District Attorney negotiated a joint plea agreement to resolve all three matters, which required defendant’s cooperation with the conspiracy investigation. Pursuant thereto, defendant entered a guilty plea to count 195 of the indictment, which charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, and she admitted violating probation. As part of that agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal as to all three matters and signed a written waiver of appeal.
At sentencing, County Court revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a one-year jail term with credit for time served on the violation petition. With respect to the attempted grand larceny conviction, the court granted defendant a conditional discharge and ordered her to pay certain restitution. The court subsequently imposed a one-year jail term on the drug-related conviction, to be served consecutively to the one-year term imposed for violating probation. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
On appeal, defendant argues that she did not get the benefit of the promised plea agreement with regard to her sentence, which she also argues is harsh and excessive. Given that defendant has completed her consecutive one-year jail sentences during the pendency of this appeal, these claims related to sentencing are moot (see People v Rodwell, 122 AD3d 1065, 1068 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1170 [2015]; People v Pozzi, 117 AD3d 1325, 1325 [2014]; People v Trombley, 111 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2013]).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Monserrate, J.), rendered May 21, 1990 in Broome County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
The only contention raised by defendant on this appeal is that his sentence was harsh and excessive. However, the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of AVi to 9 years was the most lenient sentence authorized (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and was in accordance with the plea-bargain agreement. Furthermore, another felony count was dropped as a result of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by Supreme Court in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Gray, 131 AD2d 590).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered October 19, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of 13 charges contained in an indictment stemming from his sale of cocaine on multiple occasions, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of five years, with three years of postrelease supervision, and ordered to pay restitution. He now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary, that the plea allocution was not factually sufficient, and that he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel were not preserved for our review, as he did not raise them in an appropriate postallocution motion and he made no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this matter within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [Apr. 20, 2015]). In any event, these claims lack merit. It was not necessary for defendant to personally recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual recitation, and his “unequivocal affirmative responses to County Court’s questions were sufficient to establish the elements of the crime charged” (People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780, 781 [2005]). Further, the record reflects that defendant was advised of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and the related consequences, he understood them and had adequate time to confer with counsel, and he entered the guilty plea voluntarily.
Moreover, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims predominantly concern what counsel advised him or other matters outside the record on appeal which are more properly pursued in a motion pursuant to CPL article 440, where a record could be made (see People v Jerome, 98 AD3d 1188, 1189 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 987 [2012]). Given, among other considerations, the advantageous plea agreement negotiated by counsel that greatly reduced defendant’s sentencing exposure and defendant’s acknowledged satisfaction, during the plea allocution, of counsel’s representation, we find that the record fails to support defendant’s claim that he was deprived of meaningful representation (see People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 922 [2010]; People v Corbett, 52 AD3d 1023, 1024 [2008]). Finally, in view of defendant’s criminal history and drug-selling activity, we are not persuaded that extraordinary circumstances are present or that there was an abuse of sentencing discretion so as to warrant a reduction of the favorable, bargained-for sentence in the interest of justice (see People v White, 47 AD3d 1062, 1064 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 818 [2008]). Inasmuch as the plea agreement included restitution in the amount ordered and defendant did not request a hearing or otherwise challenge the amount at sentencing, his challenge to the amount of restitution ordered is unpreserved for our review and we find that corrective action is not warranted in the interest of justice (see People v Brown, 122 AD3d 1006, 1007 [2014]).

"—Appeal by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Rockland County (Nelson, J.), both rendered February 7, 1995, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 93-00316 and assault in the second degree under Indictment No. 94-00026, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences. The appeal brings up for review the denial, without a hearing, of that branch of the defendant’s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification testimony.
Ordered that the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, to resettle the transcript of the sentence minutes, and the appeal is held in abeyance in the interim. The County Court, Rockland County, is to file the resettled transcript of the sentence minutes with all convenient speed.
The transcript of the sentence minutes indicates that the defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of three to six years imprisonment on his conviction for assault in the second degree. However, apparently due to a scrivener’s error, the order of commitment to the State Department of Correctional Services sets forth the sentence as an indeterminate term of three and one-half to seven years imprisonment. In light of the foregoing discrepancy, the matter must be remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, to resettle the transcript of the sentence minutes to reflect the sentence actually imposed by the court prior to appellate review of the issues raised (see, People v Locke, 154 AD2d 622).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered October 19, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of 2 to 6 years. Defendant appeals contending that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he thought he was receiving a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years.
Initially, although defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal at the time of his plea does not preclude him from subsequently arguing the voluntariness of his plea (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), inasmuch as defendant failed to withdraw his plea when given the opportunity by County Court at sentencing, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 831, lv denied 95 NY2d 966). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea. At a hearing prior to sentencing, defendant expressed concern that consecutive sentences would affect his eligibility for temporary release. County Court adjourned the proceeding and appointed new counsel for defendant so that the ramifications of receiving consecutive sentences could be explored. After consulting with his new attorney, defendant indicated that he did not wish to withdraw his plea. Based on these circumstances, defendant cannot be heard now to complain that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered December 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In May 1993, defendant, a permanent resident alien, was indicted on charges of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) as a result of defendant’s repeated sales of cocaine to undercover police officers. A trial was scheduled but, prior to jury selection, defendant, assisted by counsel, indicated to County Court that he wished to plead guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant subsequently entered a plea of guilty to these charges and also waived his right to appeal. However, he later made a motion to withdraw this plea. Defendant principally claimed in his motion that he agreed to plead guilty under the mistaken belief that he would not be deported following the completion of his sentence. Specifically, he claimed, inter alia, that he had been the target of coercive ""psychological and scary legal tricks and terrorization by the District Attorney’s Office”. County Court denied defendant’s motion and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court’s determination denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. There is no support in the record for defendant’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Slack, 177 AD2d 754, 755, lv denied 79 NY2d 953). Despite defendant’s unsubstantiated claims of coercion and deceptive tactics, the plea minutes make it absolutely clear that defendant’s immigration status was not a condition of the plea that defendant was entering. Moreover, even if, as defendant alleges, he was not advised prior to the entry of his plea of the possibility of deportation, the validity of his plea is not affected (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 401-403). Finally, we have examined defendant’s argument in his pro se brief that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and conclude that he was afforded meaningful representation since he received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the effectiveness of his counsel’s representation (see, supra, at 404).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Coccoma, J.), rendered May 19, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Although the terms of the negotiated plea called for a waiver of defendant’s right to appeal, the record fails to establish that defendant, either during the plea colloquy or in writing, waived his right to appeal. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 3 to 9 years with a recommendation that he be permitted to participate in a shock incarceration program. Appellate counsel for defendant now seeks to be relieved of his assignment on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that can be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record, we discern at least one appellate issue of arguable merit relating to the validity and scope of the waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006], revg People v Billingslea, 16 AD3d 516 [2005]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280, 283 [1992]). If no enforceable waiver of the right to appeal exists, defendant could challenge whether the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, supra at 253-254, 257). Inasmuch as we cannot conclude that raising such a challenge would be “wholly frivolous,” and without making any finding as to the ultimate merit of such issue, the application of defendant’s current counsel to be relieved of his assignment is granted and new counsel will be assigned to address any issue that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).

"—Mikoll, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered February 7, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was apprehended while driving his car in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County. A police search of his vehicle disclosed drugs and weapons stored in the trunk. Defendant was indicted on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and third degrees, third degree criminal possession of a weapon and third degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Defense counsel subsequently made a motion for, inter alia, a probable cause hearing leading to dismissal of the indictment based on the alleged illegal actions of the police in stopping defendant and searching his car. County Court granted the request for a probable cause hearing, but before the hearing could be held, defendant pleaded guilty to second degree criminal possession of a controlled substance in full satisfaction of the four-count indictment. Defendant was sentenced to a term of incarceration of seven years to life. Defendant appeals.
It is defendant’s contention that County Court should have issued an order dismissing the indictment against him on the ground that the police lacked probable cause to stop him and to search his car, having initially stopped defendant under the mistaken belief that he was an individual for whom they had an outstanding arrest warrant. It is apparent, however, that by entering a guilty plea prior to the probable cause hearing, defendant waived his right to raise this issue on appeal (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, 218, cert denied 475 US 1150; People v Zeoli, 212 AD2d 935, lv denied 85 NY2d 916; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 259-261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026).
We also reject defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Our review of the record discloses that defense counsel was present with defendant and provided him with competent legal representation throughout all stages of the proceedings, including negotiating a favorable plea bargain on his behalf (see, People v Strempack, 134 AD2d 799, 800, affd 71 NY2d 1015; see also, People v Noble, 209 AD2d 735, 736, lv denied 84 NY2d 1036). We conclude that defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel was fully satisfied (see, People v Pray, 199 AD2d 646-647, lv denied 83 NY2d 809).
Finally, we are not persuaded by defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. The sentence, which was the product of defendant’s plea bargain, fell within the statutory guidelines and under the circumstances presented here, cannot be said to constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court (see, People v Pray, supra, at 647).

"Garry, J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered October 31, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree, and (2) by permission, from two orders of said court, entered February 24, 2015 and August 19, 2015, which denied defendant’s motions pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. The plea agreement included a waiver of the right to appeal, but with a reservation relative to issues arising from the Mapp/suppression hearing. County Court sentenced de fendant, consistent with the terms of the agreement, to an aggregate prison term of six years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that his waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017]; People v Lanahan, 276 AD2d 906, 909 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 965 [2000]). County Court specifically advised defendant that his waiver of appeal was “separate and apart” from the other waivers related to his guilty plea, which defendant acknowledged both verbally and also by signing a written appeal waiver (see People v Upshur, 150 AD3d 1552, 1553 [2017]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]; compare People v Williford, 124 AD3d 1076, 1077 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1209 [2015]). The valid waiver thus precludes defendant’s challenges based upon the Sandoval compromise, the denial of his motion to suppress certain oral statements, and the asserted Brady violation (see People v Chant, 140 AD3d 1645, 1648 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 970 [2016]; People v Stone, 105 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2013]; People v Colon, 101 AD3d 1161, 1161-1162 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]).
As to the Mapp issues, defendant claims that the warrant-less search of his residence was improper, and that the consent provided by his girlfriend, with whom he shared the residence, was invalid. At the suppression hearing, a senior investigator with the Town of Coeymans Police Department testified that he assisted a fellow officer in conducting a traffic stop of a vehicle driven by the girlfriend, and observed her “fiddling with her pockets” as he spoke with her. She then produced several oxycodone pills from her pocket and stated that she had a valid prescription for them at her apartment, which she offered to show to the investigator and his fellow officer. Upon their arrival at the apartment, the girlfriend unlocked the door, invited the officers in and showed them a prescription bottle. The bottle did not match the pills that had been found earlier on her person. Upon request, the girlfriend then provided verbal consent for the officers to search the apartment. The second officer picked up a digital scale from atop a kitchen cabinet that had a white powdery residue. The investigator then requested and obtained the girlfriend’s written consent to continue the search. The girlfriend showed the officers to a closet in the bedroom, with an open door and containing both men’s and women’s clothing, where they found a sweatshirt wrapped around a plastic bag containing over 80 ounces of cocaine.
We agree with County Court that the evidence established that the police reasonably relied upon the girlfriend’s apparent authority to consent to the search of the shared premises, including the closet (see People v Cosme, 48 NY2d 286, 292-293 [1979]). “Even in the absence of a warrant, police may lawfully search a residence where an inhabitant with apparent authority to consent to the search freely and voluntarily does so” (People v Grillo, 128 AD3d 1103, 1104 [2015] [citations omitted]). The written consent form did not advise the girlfriend that she had the right to refuse consent, although the investigator testified that he informed her of this verbally. However, neither the failure to give such advice nor the fact that the girlfriend had been briefly handcuffed after she produced the oxycodone pills, without more, necessarily rendered her consent involuntary (see People v Curtis, 144 AD3d 1199, 1200 [2016]; People v Williford, 124 AD3d at 1078). Reviewing the totality of the circumstances presented here, and deferring to County Court’s credibility determinations (see People v Garnsey, 288 AD2d 761, 762 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 754 [2002]), we find that the girlfriend’s consent was freely and voluntarily given.
“Defendant’s argument that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent is not precluded by his waiver of appeal and was preserved by his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his guilty plea” (People v Pixley, 150 AD3d 1555, 1556 [2017] [citation omitted]; see People v Romano, 45 AD3d 910, 912 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]). However, to the extent that defendant asserts that the ineffective assistance of counsel affected the voluntariness of his plea, we find this claim to lack merit. Notably, many of the claims that defendant advances on appeal are the same challenges that his trial counsel had already presented on his behalf, and he received an advantageous plea offer based upon those efforts (see People v Dickson-Eason, 143 AD3d 1013, 1014 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1123 [2016]; People v Briggs, 138 AD3d 1355, 1356 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]). Upon review, we find no error in County Court’s denial of the motion to withdraw his plea, which was addressed to its discretion (see People v Young, 112 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1204 [2014]; People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 922 [2010]).
We next consider defendant’s related challenge to his predicate felony status, which similarly survives his appeal waiver (see People v Hartfield, 151 AD3d 1116, 1118 [2017]; People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]) and was also preserved for review. In a prior plea offer that defendant had rejected, the People expressed their intent to use defendant’s prior violent felony conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree to determine his predicate felony status. In the course of the subject plea proceeding, County Court stated that defendant would be sentenced as a nonviolent predicate offender to an aggregate prison term of six years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. However, at sentencing, the People filed a predicate felony statement in which they, once again, sought to use defendant’s past violent felony as his predicate offense. Defendant was afforded an opportunity to review that statement and confer with counsel and acknowledged the conviction; defendant’s challenge was that he had filed a motion to vacate that prior conviction. However, that conviction met the statutory requirements to be used as a predicate violent felony (see Penal Law §§ 70.02 [1] [c]; 70.06 [1] [b]; 70.70 [4] [a]), and we find no error in County Court using it to determine defendant’s predicate felony status (see CPL 400.21; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 20 [1983]; see also People v Hartfield, 151 AD3d at 1118; compare People v Lewis, 45 AD3d 898, 899 [2007]).
Finally, and significantly, County Court did not increase the agreed-upon prison terms. The six-year prison term, which placed defendant in the middle of the permissible sentencing range if his prior felony conviction was not a violent felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i]), is the statutory minimum prison term for a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [1] [b]; [4] [b] [i]). As such, we find that defendant received the benefit of his bargain (compare People v Lewis, 45 AD3d at 899). Defendant’s remaining contentions have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.
Peters, P.J., Rose, Clark and Rumsey, JJ., concur.
Ordered that the judgment and orders are affirmed.
. Were these issues before us, we would have found that the Brady claim lacks merit, and that County Court reached an appropriate Sandoval compromise (see People v Green, 270 AD2d 566, 568-569 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 853 [2000]) and did not err in denying the motion to suppress defendant’s statements (see People v Rodney, 85 NY2d 289, 293 [1995]).
. The investigator obtained a search warrant thereafter, based upon the consent previously given.
. Defendant’s challenge is premised on his assertion that the legislature’s repeal of the subsection under which he was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree prevented County Court from using the sentence as a predicate felony (see Penal Law § 265.02 [former (4)]; L 2006, ch 742, § 1). However, the Legislature did not decriminalize the act upon which defendant was convicted; instead, that act now constitutes criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (see Penal Law § 265.03 [3]; L 2006, ch 742, § 2). Regardless, at the time that defendant was convicted, his act constituted a violent felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [1] [former (c)[; L 2007, ch 7, § 32).
. In fact, defendant received an additional benefit when County Court reduced the negotiated postrelease supervision term from three years to two years (see e.g. People v Collier, 91 AD3d 987, 988 [2012], affd 22 NY3d 429 [2013], cert denied 573 US —, 134 S Ct 2730 [2014]).","Peters, P.J., Rose, Clark and Rumsey, JJ., concur.",1621,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Mercure, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered April 5, 2005, which resentenced defendant upon his conviction of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree.
Following a juiy verdict finding defendant guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree, defendant was sentenced to the authorized maximum terms of incarceration of 25 years to life and 8V3 to 25 years, respectively, said terms to run consecutively. Upon defendant’s appeal, the conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court (263 AD2d 874 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 799 [1999]). Pursuant to the provisions of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738), defendant came before County Court in 2005 for resentencing on the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. Authorized to impose a determinate sentence of at least eight years, and not exceeding 20 years (see Penal Law § 70.71 [2] [b] [i]), County Court resentenced defendant on that crime to a determinate term of 10 years (with five years of postrelease supervision), to run consecutively to the sentence previously imposed on the conspiracy conviction. Defendant appeals from the resentencing, contending that his sentence is excessive.
On defendant’s appeal from the original judgment of conviction, we found that the aggregate sentence of 3373 years to life imprisonment was severe, but not excessive in the circumstances of this case (263 AD2d 874, 877 [1999], supra). We discern no reason to rule that the substantially reduced aggregate sentence of 1873 to 25 years after the resentencing is excessive. Although County Court imposed the maximum sentence at the initial sentencing, the term of 10 years to which defendant was resentenced upon the criminal sale count is close to the minimum authorized sentence, reflecting County Court’s consideration of defendant’s favorable record while incarcerated. Nor are we persuaded that County Court abused its discretion in declining to alter defendant’s sentences to run concurrently because the same sentences imposed upon his codefendant were imposed concurrently, inasmuch as defendant bore a higher level of culpability for the crimes of which the two were convicted (id. at 876; see People v Grajales, 294 AD2d 657, 659 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 697 [2002]; see also People v Provost, 25 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 817 [2006]; People v Purcell, 8 AD3d 821, 822 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered February 26, 2004, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant waived indictment and was charged in a superior court information with the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. He pleaded guilty to this charge and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be placed on interim probation for one year and, if he successfully completed that term, he would be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced to additional probation. The sentence, however, was expressly made contingent on defendant cooperating with probation and abstaining from committing other crimes or being arrested. Defendant was sentenced accordingly. Subsequently, after it was revealed that defendant had falsified his identity and was a second felony offender, he was arrested and charged with numerous offenses, including perjury, forgery, criminal impersonation and false personation. The People moved to amend the caption of the superior court information to reflect defendant’s proper identity and alias, and also to vacate defendant’s sentence as illegal. Defendant, in turn, requested permission to withdraw his plea. County Court granted the People’s applications, denied defendant’s request to withdraw his plea and resentenced him to 5 to 10 years in prison as an admitted second felony offender. He now appeals.
Defendant’s sole argument is that the 5 to 10-year prison term imposed upon resentencing is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was fully informed during the plea proceedings that County Court would not be bound to sentence him as agreed in the event he failed to cooperate with probation, committed additional crimes or was rearrested. Yet, during those very proceedings, defendant had assumed a false identity and lied about his criminal background resulting in the eventual filing of additional criminal charges against him. Under these circumstances, and given defendant’s lengthy criminal record, we do not find an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the enhanced sentence, which was less than the statutory maximum, in the interest of justice (see People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]; People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 686 [2003]).

"Yesawich, Jr., J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), rendered August 31, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree.
Defendant was convicted of selling marihuana to an undercover State Police investigator. Prior to trial, defendant on several occasions attempted to plead guilty to the crime for which she was indicted, but County Court refused to permit her to do so; the last occasion occurred just before jury selection commenced. In again declining to accept her guilty plea, the court observed that in its judgment her endeavor to plead on that juncture simply constituted trial strategy on her part. Forced to trial, defendant, contrary to her counsel’s advice, testified in her own behalf; her testimony not only established her guilt, but was a factor taken into consideration by County Court in sentencing defendant to 1 to 4 years in prison, the maximum sentence authorized.
Defendant contends that County Court’s refusal to allow her to plead guilty violated her statutory right to do so and that, because her trial testimony apparently so offended the court that it took it into account in inflicting a harsh sentence, that error was prejudicial and requires a reversal.
CPL 220.10 (2) specifies that “[e]xcept as provided in subdivision five [which is concededly inapplicable to the case at bar], the defendant may as a matter of right eilter a plea of ‘guilty’ to the entire indictment” (emphasis supplied). Where the defendant denies guilt, or entry of the plea is not otherwise justified as knowingly and intelligently made, judicial rejection of a defendant’s proposed guilty plea is appropriate (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 235, cert denied 419 US 1122). This case is not an instance of a court seeking to protect a defendant from an injudicious plea, but rather the judicial denial of a defendant’s statutory right to plead guilty; accordingly, we reverse. Apart from County Court’s statement that it was acting in the “interest of justice” and its unexplained observation, neither documented in the record nor adequately explicated in the briefs, that defendant’s offer merely represented trial strategy, there is nothing to indicate why accepting her plea was inappropriate. While the record suggests that the court and counsel held conferences regarding defendant’s desire to plead to the indictment, what the circumstances were which led the court to exercise its discretion to refuse her plea, both earlier in the proceedings as well as on the eve of the trial, do not appear.
Defendant’s other contentions do not merit comment, except to note that defense counsel’s mistrial application based on County Court’s failure to grant a recess was properly denied, as the purpose of the recess was not to enable counsel to discuss whether defendant should testify (cf. People v Spears, 64 NY2d 698), but to record that she was testifying over his objection.
Judgment reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. Kane, J.

"Kavanagh, J.
In satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a predicate offender to an agreed-upon sentence of four years in prison, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was also ordered to forfeit the automobile that was used during the commission of the crime. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. To the extent that defendant challenges the factual sufficiency of his plea, such an argument is foreclosed by his waiver of his right to appeal and has not been preserved for our review due to defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1317 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]; People v White, 84 AD3d 1641, 1641 [2011]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]).
While defendant’s claim that his plea was involuntary survives his waiver of the right to appeal, it is also unpreserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Small, 82 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 801 [2011]; People v Campbell, 81 AD3d 1184, 1185 [2011]). Further, defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that tended to cast doubt upon his guilt and, as such, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable here (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 899 [2011]; People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d 1035, 1037 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]). In any event, his claim regarding his plea is without merit, as it is clear from the record that he was given an ample opportunity to discuss his decision to plead guilty with both his attorney and members of his family who were present in the courtroom at the time he entered his guilty plea (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d at 1035; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]).
Finally, defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal precludes review of any claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive (see People v Smith, 81 AD3d at 1035; People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d at 1037). Defendant’s remaining contentions, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered October 30, 1996, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and endangering the welfare of a child.
Defendant’s indictment on charges of criminal sale of a con trolled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and endangering the welfare of a child arises from his separate sales of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer in the City of Plattsburgh, Clinton County. Following a competency hearing, County Court found him unfit to stand trial and committed him to a psychiatric facility. After several months of treatment, defendant was determined to be in partial remission and competent to stand trial. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced, as a second felony offender, to consecutive prison terms of 5 to 10 years for each of the criminal sale counts, consecutive prison terms of 5 to 10 years for each of the criminal possession counts, to run concurrent with the sale counts, and a concurrent one-year jail term for the child endangerment conviction.
Defendant’s sole contention on this appeal is that his sentence is harsh and excessive given the evidence of his ongoing mental illness. Nevertheless, defendant was found competent to stand trial (see People v Rodney, 245 AD2d 394, 395 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 929 [1998]) and, in light of his extensive criminal history and the nature of the subject crimes, we see no abuse of County Court’s sentencing discretion nor extraordinary circumstancing warranting modification in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]; People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 917 [2000]; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 872 [1999]; see also CPL 470.15 [6] [b]).

Waiving his right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to two years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision.

Moreover, while defendant’s valid waiver of appeal precludes his contention that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Alexander, 31 AD3d 885, 886 [2006]), there is no basis in this record for reducing the sentence.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered April 8, 1998, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (six counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (six counts).
Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of six counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and six misdemeanor counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 8 Vs to 25 years on five of the felony convictions (counts 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11) and to concurrent definite one-year jail terms
on five of the misdemeanor convictions (counts 2, 4, 6, 10 and 12), all to run consecutive to an SVs to 25-year term imposed on the remaining felony conviction (count 7). The one-year jail term for count 8 — which involved defendant’s misdemeanor possession with intent to sell the same drugs for which he was convicted of selling under count 7 — is to run concurrently to the sentence imposed under count 7. On defendant’s appeal, his sole contention is that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive.
A review of the presentence report reveals that at the time of the crimes for which defendant stands convicted he was 18 years old and had completed an eighth grade education. He was previously involved in a drug treatment program which he reentered upon this incarceration. We have also considered, as did County Court, that at that time defendant was involved in a work release program in connection with a prior conviction upon a guilty plea for criminal sale of a controlled substance for which he had been adjudicated a youthful offender. We agree with County Court that the circumstances of these crimes involving six sales of narcotics on four different days during one month warranted a significant and lengthy sentence. However, considering all of the foregoing factors, we cannot agree that the defendant’s conduct warranted an aggregate sentence of 162/s years to 50 years of imprisonment.
While the imposition of the harshest consecutive sentence on count 7 in relation to the remaining sale counts was legally authorized since these sales occurred on different days, i.e., they involved separate acts (see, Penal Law §§ 70.25, 70.00 [2], [3]; see also, People v Brown, 80 NY2d 361, 364-365), we believe that the resulting aggregate sentence — a minimum of 162/s years and a maximum potential of 50 years —was unduly severe in view of defendant’s age, the nature of these crimes, his isolated prior conviction which did not represent an extensive criminal history, and the complete lack of any violent criminal history (see, People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302). While County Court properly took into consideration, inter alia, the fact that defendant had failed to learn from the opportunity presented to him by the youthful offender adjudication afforded for the prior crime he committed at age 16, we cannot agree that this or any other factor in defendant’s background warranted this excessive aggregate minimum sentence. Accordingly, the SVs to 25-year sentence imposed on count 7 of the indictment is mod ified, in the interest of justice, to run concurrently — rather than consecutively — with the sentences imposed on the remaining counts, and the terms of imprisonment imposed are otherwise affirmed (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]; see also, People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783).
Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the sentence imposed for defendant’s conviction under count 7 of the indictment for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree be served concurrently with the remaining sentences, and, as so modified, affirmed.
We note that defendant’s actual confinement would have been limited to 30 years by operation of law (see, Penal Law § 70.30 [1] [e]; see also, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575).",,701,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Lalor, J.), rendered January 11, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
As part of his plea of guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant waived his right to appeal both the judgment of conviction and the sentence. Initially, defendant may not challenge the sufficiency of the waiver or the legality of the search since he pleaded guilty to the crimes before the suppression hearing and did not subsequently move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction. Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of these claims, we would find that they are unpersuasive. Furthermore, we reject defendant’s assertion that the sentence as a second felony offender of 41/2 to 9 years in prison was harsh and excessive given that this sentence was agreed to pursuant to the negotiated plea and was within statutory parameters.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Putnam County (Reitz, J.), rendered January 31, 2014, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts), upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to a determinate term of imprisonment of 10 years on each count, to run consecutively to each other, plus a period of three years of postrelease supervision.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that the terms of imprisonment shall run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was 24 years old at the time of the plea. The defendant admitted that he sold controlled substances on four occasions between October and November 2011, for a combined total sum of $360. After failing to comply with all of the terms of his plea agreement, which required, inter alia, participation in a drug treatment program, the defendant, who had a history of substance abuse, was subsequently sentenced to a determinate term of 10 years imprisonment on each count. The County Court directed that the four terms of imprisonment run consecutively to each other, for a total aggregate term of 40 years of imprisonment.
The People contend that this Court is precluded from reviewing many of the contentions raised by the defendant on this appeal, since he validly waived his right to appeal during the plea proceeding. Contrary to the People’s contention, however, the defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to appeal (see generally People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011]; People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133, 140 [2014]).
The defendant’s contention that he was deprived of the effec tive assistance of counsel is based, in part, on matter appearing on the record and, in part, on matter outside the record and, thus, constitutes a “mixed claim” of ineffective assistance (People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2011]; see People v Evans, 16 NY3d 571, 575 n 2 [2011]). In this case, it is not evident from the matter appearing on the record that the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel (cf. People v Crump, 53 NY2d 824, 825 [1981]; People v Brown, 45 NY2d 852, 853-854 [1978]). Since the defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved without reference to matter outside the record, a CPL 440.10 proceeding is the appropriate forum for reviewing the claim in its entirety (see People v Freeman, 93 AD3d 805, 806 [2012]; People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d at 1109). However, the contentions raised in the defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 are not properly before this Court on the appeal from the judgment inasmuch as the defendant did not seek leave to appeal from the order denying that motion (see People v Washington, 45 AD3d 880 [2007]; People v Wynn, 40 AD3d 893 [2007]).
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying his request for an adjournment prior to sentencing (see People v Struss, 79 AD3d 773, 774 [2010]; People v McRae, 62 AD3d 723, 724 [2009]).
However, the sentence imposed was excessive to the extent that the County Court directed that the four determinate terms run consecutively to each other. Accordingly, we modify the judgment as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice by providing that the terms of imprisonment imposed upon the defendant’s conviction of each of the four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree shall run concurrently with each other.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Battisti Jr., J.), rendered June 26, 1990, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant claims that County Court improperly denied his motion for a hearing to determine whether he had provided the ""material assistance” required under Penal Law § 65.00 (1) (b) to qualify for lifetime probation. At the time of defendant’s plea, the People indicated that they would recommend a prison sentence of 4 Vi to 9 years with a ""possibility” of lifetime probation if defendant cooperated with the authorities; at defendant’s sentencing the People stated that defendant had not provided such assistance to the authorities. No promises were made for such a recommendation (see, People v Lofton, 58 AD2d 610) and, in the absence of consent or a recommendation by the People to a sentence of lifetime probation as required by statute, the court lacked the authority to impose such a sentence (see, People v Smith, 154 AD2d 934, lv denied 75 NY2d 776; People v Edwards, 148 AD2d 923, lv denied 74 NY2d 794). Accordingly, the prison sentence of 4 Vi to 9 years imposed pursuant to the plea bargain should be affirmed (see, People v Loebl, 77 AD2d 949).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered October 1, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
By agreement, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in return for the dismissal of pending robbery and assault charges as well as the prosecution’s agreement not to pursue potential perjury charges. In addition, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and the prosecution and defense counsel agreed to a joint sentencing recommendation of 2 to 4 years in prison. County Court, however, did not promise to abide by the joint sentencing agreement or to impose a particular sentence, but rather advised defendant that he could receive up to seven years in prison. After defendant entered his guilty plea, County Court sentenced him as a predicate felony offender to SVs to 7 years in prison. He now appeals.
Defendant’s main argument is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because he did not obtain the benefit of the joint sentencing recommendation. To the extent that this claim is directed at sentencing, not the voluntariness of the plea, it is precluded by defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Howard, 1 AD3d 718, 719 [2003]).
Defendant further contends that his plea and waiver of the right to appeal were not knowing, voluntary or intelligent because they were entered in reliance on the joint sentencing recommendation. Such claim is similarly unpreserved due to the absence of a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). The narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as nothing in the plea colloquy casts doubt on defendant’s guilt (see People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]). Moreover, he was fully advised of the consequences of pleading guilty and waiving his right to appeal and affirmatively communicated to County Court his understanding and desire to enter the plea.

Appeal from a júdgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Sypniewski, J.), rendered May 15, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
In 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was permitted to participate in a drug treatment program and, upon successful completion, would be sentenced to no more than five years of probation. Otherwise, County Court had the discretion to sentence defendant up to the maximum statutory prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. Defendant absconded from the drug treatment program and, following his return to court in 2015, County Court sentenced him to the maximum prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. Defendant now appeals.
We agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that County Court did not explain “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Herbert, 147 AD3d 1208, 1208 [2017]). Furthermore, although a detailed written appeal waiver was executed by defendant, the court made “no attempt ... to ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver” (People v Herbert, 147 AD3d at 1209 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). As such, defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed is not precluded by the appeal waiver. We are, nevertheless, unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the sentence is harsh and excessive. A review of the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of the court’s discretion and, as such, the sentence imposed will not be disturbed (see People v Woodward, 43 AD3d 496, 496 [2007]; People v Hope, 32 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2006]; see also People v Griffin, 284 AD2d 809, 810 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 682 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), rendered June 30, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (two counts).
At trial, the People presented the testimony of a police informant, two State Police officers and a State Police forensic scientist. Defendant was the sole witness presented by the defense. The People’s evidence established the sale by defendant of controlled substances to the police informant individually and also to the informant and an undercover police officer in each other’s presence. It was defendant’s contention that the sales were made as an accommodation to and for the benefit of the informant who, defendant further contended, provided the controlled substances which were sold. The jury accepted the evidence presented by the People and rejected the version of events offered by defendant and found defendant guilty on all counts. The trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment having a maximum term of 25 years and a minimum term of 8 Vs years on each count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, to run consecutively, and a lesser term of imprisonment upon the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree to run concurrently with the other sentences imposed.
On appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. The imposition of a maximum sentence does not necessarily mean that the trial court abused its discretion (People v Purdie, 58 AD2d 715). In this case, if the aggregate minimum and maximum periods of imprisonment are added to arrive at an aggregate of each, the terms of imprisonment would be a minimum of 25 years and a maxi mum of 75 years. In such circumstances, however, the Department of Correctional Services is required to calculate defendant’s term of imprisonment so that the aggregate maximum term of imprisonment under the sentences imposed does not exceed 30 years and the aggregate minimum period of imprisonment does not exceed 15 years (Penal Law § 70.30 [1] [b]). The sentences, as such, are not illegal and do not require modification, but shall be deemed to be within the limits set forth above (see, People v Moore, 61 NY2d 575).
There is also an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel raised by defendant, who contends, among other things, that his trial counsel should have raised a defense of entrapment. Such a defense would be inappropriate and without foundation or support in this record. Moreover, the necessary elements to provide this defense are negated by defendant’s own testimony. Upon the record in its entirety, we find nothing to suggest that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Nor do we find any merit in the issues raised by defendant pro se. These issues relate to evidentiary matters which do not provide any basis to disturb the verdict of the jury.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Dwyer, Jr., J.), rendered August 3, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, all class D felonies. The charges stemmed from two separate incidents, one on March 7, 1986 and the other on March 13, 1986, and as a result were contained in two separate indictments. Just before jury selection on the day set for trial, defendant requested the appointment of a new attorney to represent him. His request was denied due to its lateness. Thereupon, defendant indicated his willingness to accept the plea bargain previously offered him. This agreement permitted defendant to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale in the fifth degree and one count of criminal possession in the fifth degree, and to have a further charge then pending against him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree dismissed, in exchange for the imposition of concurrent prison sentences of 3 Vi to 7 years on each count. In the course of reciting the terms of the plea bargain for the record, the Assistant District Attorney stated that if convicted of the charges, defendant would be required to receive consecutive sentences, since the crimes were committed a week apart. The prosecution concedes on this appeal that such statement was error. Defendant now urges that the statement induced his plea and was coercive, that he should have been assigned new counsel, and that the sentence imposed, although in accordance with the plea bargain, was harsh and excessive.
The record reveals that defendant made no motion to withdraw his plea at the time of his sentencing; nor did defendant ever demonstrate good cause why new counsel should have been assigned to him on the day scheduled for trial, which was over 16 months after his indictment. In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court’s denial of defendant’s request for new counsel (see, People v Tineo, 64 NY2d 531, 536-537; People v Medina, 44 NY2d 199, 207-208).
In regard to the prosecutor’s misstatement of the law relating to consecutive sentences, we find it significant that defendant had indicated a willingness to accept the plea bargain before the misstatement was made, and defendant never questioned the statement or stated that he felt compelled by it or that he was relying on it in entering his plea of guilty. Defendant was at all times represented by competent counsel. The plea bargain he received was fair and favorable in all respects, and at the time of sentencing defendant must have so considered it since he made no effort to withdraw his plea.
We find that the plea was freely and voluntarily made by defendant and that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive. The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered July 20, 2009 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After being indicted on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was released on bail and executed a written Parker admonishment. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree on the understanding that she would be sentenced as a second felony drug offender to a prison term of three years and postrelease supervision of two years, to run concurrently to the sentence imposed in a separate proceéding. She further waived her right to appeal and, reinforcing her earlier Parker warnings, was told that her failure to appear for sentencing could result in an enhanced sentence of up to eight years of imprisonment to be followed by postrelease supervision. Defendant did not appear for sentencing, and Supreme Court sentenced her in absentia to a prison term of five years to be followed by postrelease supervision of three years. She now appeals.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered March 10, 2011, which convicted defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After the jury was sworn at the start of trial, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. The plea satisfied a four-count indictment charging defendant with the sale of cocaine on two occasions in 2010. He was sentenced, as agreed, to a prison term of 4V2 years with two years of post-release supervision, and now appeals.
Defendant’s argument that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that his allocution was not factually sufficient were not preserved for review in this Court by a postallocution motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2010]; see also People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 363-364 [2013]). Defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea or his guilt so as to implicate the exception to the preservation requirement (see id,.). In fact, when asked by County Court at sentencing, defendant specifically declined an opportunity to withdraw his plea. In any event, the record establishes the knowing, voluntary and intelligent nature of his plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365; People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]).
Next, defendant argues that County Court’s failure to read or consider his 17-page pro se submission put forth at sentencing requires that his plea be vacated. Given that defendant was represented by counsel and was not entitled to hybrid rep resentation, we do not find that the court abused its discretion by not entertaining his pro se submission before imposing sentence (see People v Rodriguez, 95 NY2d 497, 500-502 [2000]; People v Alsaifullah, 96 AD3d 1103, 1103 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 994 [2012]), particularly where he did not request an adjournment of sentencing or the removal of counsel. We find that the court properly proceeded to sentence defendant, having ascertained that he did not wish to withdraw his guilty plea. Defendant’s contention that the bargained-for sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice is foreclosed by his valid and unchallenged waiver of appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; compare People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). Defendant’s remaining claims similarly lack merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered July 30, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of conspiracy in the second degree.
In October 1992, defendant participated in activities which resulted in his arrest for possession and sale of more than two ounces of cocaine. He was subsequently indicted for the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, conspiracy in the second degree and criminal facilitation in the second degree. Preliminarily, defendant moved, inter alia, for discovery, inspection and disclosure, suppression of evidence, dismissal of the indictment and/or pretrial hearings addressing the legality of procedures used by the police agencies.
County Court, inter alia, partially granted defendant’s motion by ordering a variety of hearings prior to trial, including Huntley and Mapp hearings, but failed to address those issues concerning the arresting officer’s lack of geographical jurisdiction, due process and discovery. Subsequent to the suppression hearing, where sufficient probable cause for the arrest was found, defendant entered a plea of guilty to conspiracy in the second degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 4Vi to 9 years. Defendant now appeals.
While defendant has not waived his right to appeal, his guilty plea ""generally represents a compromise or bargain struck after negotiation between defendant and the People. As such, it marks the end of a criminal case, not a gateway to further litigation” (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5). It similarly serves as a forfeiture of nonjurisdictional defects so that only an ""extremely limited group of issues * * * may properly be raised on a subsequent appeal” (People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026). With these precepts at hand, and no challenge to the validity of the plea, we find that defendant’s contentions addressing the arresting officer’s lack of geographical jurisdiction or, alternatively, that the evidence resulting therefrom should have been suppressed, were waived by his plea of guilty.
Such plea similarly forecloses appellate review of defendant’s contentions regarding County Court’s denial of requests for additional discovery, inspection and disclosure (see, People v Cusani, 153 AD2d 574). As to defendant’s contentions regarding egregious police conduct by its use of an informant who called and harassed him over a six-month period, we find nothing in the record indicating conduct rising to the level of misconduct found in People v Isaacson (44 NY2d 511). Accordingly, defendant’s plea waives appellate review of this issue as well (see, People v Persico, 131 AD2d 603, lv denied 70 NY2d 716; People v Rodriguez, 79 AD2d 539, affd 55 NY2d 776).
Finally, defendant challenges the finding of probable cause contending that it was based upon information supplied by a confidential informant whose reliability was not established. A review of the record reflects that the first-hand knowledge of police officers provided sufficient probable cause for defendant’s arrest, rendering any concern regarding the reliability of the confidential informant irrelevant (see, Spinelli v United States, 393 US 410; Aguilar v Texas, 378 US 108).
As to all other contentions raised, we find them to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered November 19, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree as part of a negotiated plea wherein he waived his right to appeal. It was agreed that defendant was to be sentenced to 2 to 4 years in prison. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing, scheduled first for March 24, 1992 and then for May 17, 1992. He was subsequently apprehended on a bench warrant and was ultimately sentenced, on November 19, 1993, to the agreed-upon sentence.
The irregularities complained of by defendant on this appeal are directed to denial of his right to an open trial when allegedly closure of the courtroom during the Wade hearing was ordered, irregularities in identification which defendant contends require suppression and denial of a speedy trial. We find these contentions to be meritless.
The record reveals that County Court never acted on the request to close the Wade hearing, having noted that there was no one to exclude and the undercover witness, whose identity was sought to be protected, testified freely revealing his full name and identity. Defendant’s attack on the reliability of identification testimony and speedy trial arguments are likewise to no avail. These were waived by defendant’s free and knowing waiver of his right to appeal as part of his negotiated plea of guilty (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 7).

Defendant, then 16 years old, was convicted upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years; he was also sentenced to two one-year terms of imprisonment for his conviction of criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree and criminal impersonation in the second degree. All sentences were concurrent. Defendant now argues that County Court erred in denying him youthful offender status. We disagree. There is no basis upon which to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in this regard insofar as the court considered all of the relevant factors, including the seriousness of the crime, defendant’s prior unsuccessful involvement in the juvenile justice system and the negative recommendation in the presentence report (see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 334, affd sub nom.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered January 24, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Faced with indictments charging nine counts involving the possession and sale of cocaine on September 29, 1992, defendant entered into a plea agreement, the terms of which included supervised release on $2,500 bail pending sentencing, a prison sentence of 7½ to 15 years as a second felony offender and a four-week adjournment for sentencing. The agreement also provided that if defendant failed to appear for sentencing without justification, County Court would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence and defendant would be exposed to persistent felony offender treatment and a sentence of 25 years to life. Sentencing was scheduled, and defendant was given Parker warnings (see, People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141) and admonished that, inter alia, failure to appear at sentencing would likely result in persistent felony offender treatment. Difficulties in arranging probation supervision of defendant necessitated County Court’s intervention and resulted in an 18-day delay in defendant’s release. At that time, defendant was again admonished concerning his scheduled sentencing.
Defendant absconded only to be arrested several months later on a bench warrant. Defendant admitted that he did not have a legitimate excuse for his nonappearance, and pursuant to a sentencing bargain which included no prosecution on the bail jumping matter and an admission of his persistent felony offender status, he was sentenced to 15 years to life. Defendant appeals.
There is no merit to defendant’s contention that County Court’s refusal to extend the date of sentencing after the 18-day delay in his presentence release warrants a reversal. This issue was not preserved for appellate review, for defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate his judgment of conviction (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Moreover, the record fails to establish how much of the delay was attributed to arranging supervision and how much to defendant’s efforts to arrange bail. Despite the delay, defendant had three weeks of presentence release before his failure to appear.
Also unpersuasive is defendant’s claim that he was not afforded an opportunity to explain his nonappearance. The ultimate sentence imposed was the result of a new bargain made because of, and following, defendant’s failure to appear for his scheduled sentencing. Though the reason given by defendant for not appearing was acknowledged to be inadequate, defendant declined an opportunity to elaborate upon any justification or excuse. Inasmuch as the record established that defendant breached his unequivocal appearance requirement by absconding without any exculpatory reason, County Court’s imposition of the enhanced sentence was not an abuse of discretion (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J), rendered October 15, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Police executing a search warrant discovered that defendant was in possession of approximately 45 pounds of cocaine. In January 2002, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment charging that crime and a lesser count. Sentencing was adjourned to allow defendant to assist the authorities with additional criminal investigations. In April 2003, defense counsel moved to withdraw, alleging a conflict of interest in that seven or eight months earlier he was retained to represent an individual who, unbeknownst to counsel at that time, was the subject of a criminal investigation with which defendant was cooperating. After defense counsel was relieved, new defense counsel moved to withdraw defendant’s plea alleging that previous counsel was ineffective due to his conflicted representation and that he misled defendant by advising him that his cooperation could result in a sentence of time served. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant to a prison term of 15 years to life. Defendant appeals, asserting that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea. We disagree.
Upon review of the record, we discern no basis to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s application to withdraw his guilty plea (see People v Leonard, 25 AD3d 925, 926 [2006]; People v Marshall, 13 AD3d 801, 802 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 888 [2005]). Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unavailing inasmuch as the record reveals that his attorney did not represent the individual against whom he was cooperating until at least eight months after defendant pleaded guilty. Consequently, defendant does not and cannot point to any facts demonstrating that “ ‘the conduct of his defense was in fact affected by the operation of the conflict of interest,’ or that the conflict ‘operated on’ the representation” (People v Ortiz, 76 NY2d 652, 657 [1990], quoting People v Alicea, 61 NY2d 23, 31 [1983]; see People v Harris, 99 NY2d 202, 210 [2002]).
Defendant’s contention that he was induced into pleading guilty by the promise of a sentence of time served is belied by the record evidence, which establishes that, prior , to pleading guilty, defendant consulted with counsel and expressed his satisfaction with his services, was fully apprised of and understood his rights, ensured that he was pleading guilty of his own free will and not in exchange for any promises other than those laid out on the record, and acknowledged that, pursuant to the plea agreement, his sentence would be no greater than 16 years to life. Defendant then freely admitted his guilt and the facts underlying the crime. Significantly, although defendant alleges in his motion affidavit that counsel advised him on numerous occasions that as a result of his cooperation his sentence would be reduced to time served, defendant does not allege that counsel made such a representation to him prior to the plea. Without any allegations of such facts, County Court was not required to grant defendant a hearing on his motion. Under the circumstances, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation at the time of his plea and entered his guilty plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see People v Bolden, 14 AD3d 934, 935 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 796 [2005]).

Upon her plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that the sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice to 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment. Defendant, who was represented by competent counsel, pleaded guilty knowing that she would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. In light of this and the fact that her 13-year-old son was one of the parties to whom she supplied cocaine, we do not find that her sentence was harsh or excessive (see, People v Salgado, 156 AD2d 492, lv denied 75 NY2d 817; People v Wolmart, 140 AD2d 733, lv denied 72 NY2d 926).

After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced as a predicate felon to a prison term of 121/2 to 25 years. Defendant argues that County Court abused its discretion in considering defendant’s statement in which he denied possessing drugs as a factor in imposing the harshest possible sentence. Upon our review of the sentencing transcript, we do not find that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant. County Court considered the subject statement as indicative of defendant’s lack of remorse for his actions. It also considered defendant’s past criminal history and the nature of the crime. Moreover, insofar as the cases relied upon by defendant involved sentences imposed in connection with plea agreements, we find them distinguishable from the case at hand (see, e.g., People v Carr, 135 AD2d 722; People v Daniels, 132 AD2d 667).

Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, waived his right to appeal. As part of the plea bargain, County Court made a commitment to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of no longer than 10 years to life. At sentencing, County Court deemed it appropriate after reading the presentence memoranda to impose a sentence of 8 years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals, arguing that this sentence was harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, this issue has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Paulin, 265 AD2d 737; People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Moreover, were we to reach this issue, we would find no evidence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the less than maximum sentence imposed in the interest of justice (see, People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, 740-741, lv denied 93 NY2d 968). Notably, all of the mitigating or extenuating circumstances to which defendant makes reference on appeal were before County Court and taken into consideration at the time of defendant’s sentencing (see, People v Johnstone, 184 AD2d 929, lv denied 80 NY2d 905).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Mc-Keighan, J.), rendered October 17, 2008, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that she knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived her right to appeal. Before defendant executed a written waiver of the right to appeal, County Court explained the waiver to her during the plea colloquy and ensured that she understood the waiver and had discussed it with counsel. Thereafter, defendant, assisted by counsel, executed a written waiver in open court that also reflected that counsel had advised her of her right to appeal, and that she had discussed the waiver with counsel and was freely waiving such right. Under these circumstances, defendant’s appeal waiver is valid (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Vaughns, 70 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010]; People v Mosher, 45 AD3d 970, 970 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008] ).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered February 7, 2001 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. Fursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty as charged and waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence of 21k to 7V2 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and 3V2 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, the sentences to run consecutively. Frior to sentencing, defendant, through his counsel, agreed to change the terms of the plea agreement to reflect a sentence that could later benefit his parole status. Defendant was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the amended plea agreement to concurrent sentences of 3 to 6 years for his controlled substance conviction and six years for his weapon conviction. This appeal ensued.
Initially, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea, while not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, is not preserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 934 [2004]; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). In any event, our examination of the plea minutes reveals that County Court (Rosen, J.) properly ascertained that defendant was entering the plea free of duress and coercion, he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he had discussed the matter with defense counsel, was satisfied with the services he was provided and he understood the rights he was relinquishing as a result of the plea (see People v Hermanee, 12 AD3d 851, 852 [2004]; People v Hill, 11 AD3d 817, 817-818 [2004]; People v Grier, 11 AD3d 816, 816-817 [2004]).
With respect to defendant’s attack upon the sufficiency of the plea allocution, we note that defendant was not required to independently recite the facts underlying the crime to which he pleaded guilty where his affirmative and unequivocal responses to County Court’s inquiry did not otherwise signal doubt regarding his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Mahar, 12 AD3d 715, 716 [2004]; People v Snare, 11 AD3d 823, 824 [2004]; People v Pringle, 10 AD3d 802, 803 [2004]). Accordingly, we find that defendant’s plea was in all respects voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Defendant’s remaining argument that his sentence is harsh and excessive is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Valentino, 10 AD3d 800, 801 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered August 15, 2012, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived her right to appeal. County Court indicated that it would consider whether to order substance abuse treatment after reviewing the presentence investigation report, but did not promise that treatment would be ordered. Thereafter, the court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to a prison term of four years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. The court declined defendant’s request to order substance abuse treatment, noting that defendant had failed in several prior treatment programs. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s valid waiver of the right to appeal, which she does not challenge, bars her claims that her sentence was harsh and excessive, and that County Court should have directed further substance abuse treatment (see People v Borst, 121 AD3d 1424, 1425 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]). Similarly, that waiver bars her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel inasmuch as she does not contend that the alleged ineffective assistance impacted the voluntariness of her plea (see People v Livziey, 117 AD3d 1341, 1342 [2014]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1267 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]).

"Kavanagh, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered October 15, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In June 2007, defendant was charged by indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and loitering in the first degree. After initially rejecting a plea offer, defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of all three counts contained in the indictment, and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years, with two years of postrelease supervision. At the time he entered his plea, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a written waiver to that effect with the assistance of counsel. At his sentencing, defendant stated that he was dissatisfied with counsel and claimed that he did not fully understand all of his rights when he entered his plea. County Court reviewed the content of defendant’s plea allocution and, in particular, the description of the rights given to defendant that he agreed to waive when he entered his plea. After concluding that defendant had knowingly and intelligently entered his guilty plea, County Court imposed sentence pursuant to the terms of the negotiated plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, claiming that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel and his plea, as well as his waiver of the right to appeal, were involuntarily entered. Defendant also claims that his sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice.
Initially, while defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not voluntary, the record reveals that the consequences of such a waiver were clearly and adequately explained to defendant by County Court and this explanation was reinforced by the content of a written waiver of appeal form that defendant executed with the assistance of counsel (see People v Lopez, 52 AD3d 852, 853 [2008]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]). Therefore, we find, contrary to defendant’s contention, that he voluntarily waived his right to appeal.
Despite this finding, defendant’s claim.of ineffective assistance of counsel survives the waiver of his right to appeal because, as made, it raises an issue as to the voluntariness of his guilty plea (see People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122,1124 [2009]; People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d 811, 812 [2008]; People v Morelli, 46 AD3d 1215, 1217 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008]). Having reviewed this claim, we find that it is belied by the record. Specifically, defendant argues that his counsel advised him to plead guilty before ever reviewing a laboratory report regarding the findings of a chemical analysis of the substance found on defendant’s possession at the time of his arrest. However, the record establishes that defense counsel was, in fact, provided with a report of a field test performed at the time of defendant’s arrest that found that the substance in his possession tested positive for the presence of crack cocaine. In addition, during his plea allocution, County Court inquired, and defendant confirmed, that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel prior to entering the plea, was satisfied with his representation, and was under no emotional or medical disability or under the influence of any substance that prevented him from making an intelligent and voluntary decision to enter a guilty plea. Moreover, defense counsel was able to negotiate an advantageous plea agreement that enabled defendant to plead guilty to a reduced charge in full satisfaction of all of the charges pending against him. Therefore, we reject defendant’s claim that he did not receive meaningful representation of counsel or that his plea was not voluntarily entered (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781-782 [2009]; People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d at 813; People v Lopez, 52 AD3d at 853; People v Henning, 2 AD3d 979, 980 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 740 [2004]).
Finally, as defendant executed a valid waiver of his right to appeal, his claim that the bargained-for sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded (see People v Borom, 55 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2008]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058-1059 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]).
Mercure, J.E, Spain, Malone Jr. and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
For the purposes of preservation, we conclude that defendant’s pro se challenge to the effectiveness of his counsel before County Court at sentencing constituted a motion to vacate his plea and, therefore, preserved this claim for the purposes of appeal (see People v Rubeo, 60 AD3d 1206, 1207 [2009]; People v Dawson, 278 AD2d 665, 667 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 799 [2001]).",,826,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Cawley Jr., J.), rendered October 7, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Following his sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer on five separate occasions, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Prior to entering a guilty plea to the charged crimes, defendant applied for participation in the judicial diversion program (see CPL art 216). Following an evaluation and a hearing, County Court (Pelella, J.) denied defendant’s request. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty as charged with the understanding that his sentence would be capped at six years of imprisonment followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court (Cawley Jr., J.) thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision upon each count of the indictment, with said sentences to run concurrently with one another. Defendant now appeals, contending that it was an abuse of discretion to deny his request for judicial diversion and, further, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Preliminarily, to the extent that defendant suggests that the agency to which he was referred was not authorized to perform his alcohol and drug assessment, challenges the sufficiency of the evaluation actually performed and/or faults the People for failing to call the evaluator to testify at the hearing, we need note only that defendant failed to raise any objections in this regard at such hearing and, therefore, has failed to preserve these issues for our review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). Turning to the merits, “under the program created by CPL article 216, whether an eligible defendant will be offered judicial diversion pursuant to that article remains within the trial court’s discretion, and [a] defendant is not automatically entitled to judicial diversion” (People v Meddaugh, 150 AD3d 1545, 1547 [2017]; see CPL 216.05 [4]; People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d 1157, 1159 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]; People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2013]; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]). Pursuant to the statute, CPL 216.05 required County Court (Pelella, J.)—upon completion of the underlying hearing—to consider and make findings of fact as to whether defendant was eligible for participation in the judicial diversion program, whether he had a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependance, whether such abuse or dependence was a contributing factor to his criminal behavior, whether his participation in the program could effectively address such abuse or dependence and, finally, whether confinement was or might be necessary for the protection of the public (see CPL 216.05 [3] [b] [i]-[v]; People v Cora, 135 AD3d 987, 989 [2016]).
Although County Court deemed defendant to be eligible for participation in the judicial diversion program and concluded that defendant indeed “may have a history of alcohol or substance abuse,” the court nonetheless denied defendant’s application, finding that any such history was “not a contributing factor to . . . defendant’s criminal behavior.” Defendant now argues that County Court erred in neglecting to address the remaining statutory factors and, in any event, abused its discretion in denying his application for participation in the judicial diversion program. We disagree. Even assuming, without deciding, that County Court indeed was required to consider and make express findings as to each of the enumerated statutory factors, we nonetheless do not find that the court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s request for judicial diversion. Simply put, given defendant’s extensive criminal history, which includes a conviction for a violent felony, the record does not reflect any basis upon which to conclude that granting defendant’s request for judicial diversion would have been appropriate (see People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d at 1159; People v Powell, 110 AD3d at 1384).
As for defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed, defendant was promised that his sentence would be capped at six years of imprisonment, and he ultimately was sentenced to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Upon reviewing the record, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Georges, 151 AD3d 1402, 1403 [2017]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered May 24, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of bail jumping in the first degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. After he failed to appear for trial, a separate indictment was handed up charging him with bail jumping in the first degree. Defendant pleaded guilty to that indictment and, following a jury trial, was convicted of the drug charges (People v Giroux, 122 AD3d 1063 [2014] [decided herewith]). County Court sentenced him to a prison term of IV3 to 4 years on the bail jumping conviction, running consecutively to the aggregate sentence imposed upon the drug convictions. Defendant now appeals, arguing solely that County Court’s direction that the sentences run consecutively was harsh and excessive. As “we find no abuse of the sentencing court’s discretion or the existence of any extraordinary circumstance which would warrant our modification of the consecutive sentences” given the circumstances presented in this case, we disagree and affirm (People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746, 748 [2001]; see People v De Stefano, 29 AD3d 1030, 1032 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 755 [2006]; People v Halm, 256 AD2d 630, 630-631 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 1049 [1999]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered October 22, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a 17-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement to two years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. His current argument that his guilty plea was involuntary was preserved by his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his plea and survives his valid appeal waiver (see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1233 [2012]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2011]); however, it is without merit. The record reveals that defendant unequivocally acknowledged that he understood the consequences of pleading guilty and, by his affirmative responses to County Court’s inquiries, freely admitted committing the crime to which he was pleading guilty (see People v Davis, 84 AD3d 1645, 1646 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 815 [2011]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d at 1343). Furthermore, while defendant’s claim of ineffective representation survives his appeal waiver to the extent that such representation might have affected the voluntariness of his plea, defendant’s argument that counsel pressured him during certain conversations to accept the plea offer involves matters outside the record and is thus more properly raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v DeJesus, 96 AD3d 1295, 1295-1296 [2012]; People v Pendelton, 81 AD3d 1037, 1038-1039 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 898 [2011]). In all other respects, the record reflects that defendant received meaningful representation, culminating in a very favorable plea bargain (see People v Shurock, 83 AD3d at 1344; People v Chaney, 70 AD3d 1251, 1252-1253 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 748 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered May 30, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment* stemming from the sale of heroin on three occasions, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in the first count. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and signed a written waiver in open court and, in exchange, County Court agreed to impose a prison term of seven years with three years of postrelease supervision. The court thereafter exercised its discretion and sentenced defendant, as an admitted second felony offender, to six years in prison with three years of postrelease supervision, and ordered that he make restitution. Defendant now appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record and counsel’s brief, we agree.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered February 1, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and forgery in the second degree.
Defendant was charged in one indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and in a second indictment with four counts of forgery in the second degree. In full satisfaction of both indictments, she pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and forgery in the second degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was told that the sentence would be consecutive terms of one year in the local jail for each conviction. Prior to sentencing, County Court received a presentence investigation report which recommended, in the event that defendant were determined not to be a second felony offender, imposition of a split sentence of incarceration in the local jail and probation. As defendant was not found to be a second felony offender, County Court sentenced her in accordance with the plea agreement.
Defendant now appeals, asserting that her guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent essentially because, at the time she entered the plea, she did not know that the presentence investigation report would recommend a split sentence instead of incarceration. Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw her plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, she has not preserved this claim for our review (see People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662; People v Benjamin, 296 AD2d 666, 667). Significantly, at the sentencing hearing when defendant expressed disappointment with the sentence imposed, County Court offered her the opportunity to withdraw the plea, an offer of which defendant did not avail herself.
Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s claim, we would find it to be without any merit. During the plea proceedings, defense counsel advised County Court that defendant wished to accept the plea offer which defendant understood included the imposition of consecutive terms of one-year local jail time for each crime; defendant expressly confirmed her desire to so plead. While County Court indicated that defendant would be afforded the opportunity to withdraw her plea if the presentence investigation report recommended state prison time, no such offer was extended in the event the report recommended a split sentence. That the report recommended a sentence less than that to which defendant agreed does not render the guilty plea involuntary or unknowing since defendant received the benefit of her bargain. Accordingly, defendant asserts no viable reason to disturb the judgment of conviction.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered October 11, 1988, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.
On appeal, defendant, represented by counsel, maintains that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel by reason of the joint indictment of David Peralta, defendant’s brother, and their joint representation by the same trial counsel. Defendant also submitted a pro se brief wherein he argues that the People failed to comply with County Court’s order regarding Rosario material, that County Court failed to charge that accomplice testimony must be independently corroborated, and that the sentence was harsh and excessive.
Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals in People v Marcerola (47 NY2d 257, 263) stated: ""While a defendant may choose to retain his attorney^ ] such choice may be made only after the defendant is informed of the possible ramifications which joint representation might spawn when conflicting interests arguably exist. Only after sufficient admonition by the trial court of the potential pitfalls of joint representation can it be said that a defendant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel is adequately safeguarded. If such admonition does appear on the record, appellate courts are able to determine whether a defendant’s decision to retain his attorney is indeed an informed choice” (footnote omitted). Here, the record clearly reveals that County Court closely examined defendant to ascertain if he was aware of the potential risks involved in joint representation and that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently chose to proceed with simultaneous representation of himself and his brother. Under such circumstances, there was no denial of defendant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel.
Turning to the arguments raised in defendant’s pro se brief, we reject defendant’s contention that the People failed to comply with County Court’s order to turn over all Rosario material for inspection by defendant, particularly a written report entitled DEA 6. The cross-examination by defense counsel of Special Agent Ulises Delgado clearly shows that defendant’s exhibit C for identification, the DEA 6 report, was in the possession of defendant’s counsel. Next, defendant’s argument that County Court failed to charge that the accomplice testimony of Hector Gutierrez must be independently corroborated is not only belied by the record, it also appears that defendant did not object to County Court’s charge concerning accomplice testimony, thereby failing to preserve this issue for appellate review (see, People v Vail, 167 AD2d 567).
Finally, we are of the view that the sentence must be modified to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 15 years to life. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 25 years to life although his brother, who was jointly tried and convicted of the same crimes, was sentenced to the concurrent 15-years-to-life prison terms. In the absence of any cognizable reason to justify the different sentences, we are of the view that defendant’s sentence must be modified (see, People v Williams, 145 AD2d 740).
Judgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentences imposed upon defendant to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 15 years to life, and, as so modified, affirmed.

Since the defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive the sentence which was thereafter actually imposed, he has no basis to now complain that his sentence was excessive (see People v Brown, 287 AD2d 464 [2001]; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816 [1984]). In any event, the defendant’s sentence was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).
Defense counsel’s ability to limit his client’s conviction to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and to limit the sentence to 4 to 8 years imprisonment refutes the defendant’s claim that he was denied meaningful representation (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]).

Upon his pleas of guilty to three separate indictments, defendant received eight concurrent prison sentences, the harshest of which was six years to life.

Defendant was indicted for the A-I felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, and subsequently pleaded guilty to the A-II felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 8V3 years to life, the maximum term of imprisonment for an A-II felony.

The statute in question is not uncon stitutional on its face (see, People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert denied 423 US 950). Further, given the amount of cocaine involved and defendant’s admitted knowing possession, we do not find that this is one of the ""rare case[s]” envisioned in People v Broadie (supra, at 119) in which the application of the statute constitutes cruel and unusual punishment (see, People v Marine, 162 AD2d 275; People v Miller, 126 AD2d 868, lv denied 69 NY2d 884). In addition, in light of these facts, as well as the facts that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged and agreed to the sentence as a part of a negotiated plea bargain, we do not find that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive (see, People v Hadden, 158 AD2d 856, lv denied 76 NY2d 847).
We find, however, that County Court erred in failing to exercise its discretion in sentencing defendant. In accepting defendant’s plea, County Court stated that it was ""obligated” to impose the harshest sentence allowable based upon the plea bargain. The failure of County Court to exercise its independent judgment requires that the case be remitted to County Court for resentencing (see, People v Terry, 152 AD2d 822). Should County Court impose a sentence more lenient than that agreed to by the People, they must be accorded an opportunity to withdraw their consent to plea (see, supra).

Pursuant to a counseled plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment and was sentenced to the maximum permissible prison term of SVs years to life. On appeal, defendant contends that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. The record reveals that drug packaging materials, balance scales, over $1,500 in cash and more than eight ounces of cocaine evidencing defendant’s extensive involvement in procuring the drugs were recovered from defendant’s home. Notwithstanding defendant’s lack of criminal history, given these factors and the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the negotiated plea bargain, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor abuse of discretion warranting a modification of the sentence imposed (see, People v Mares, 256 AD2d 692, lv denied 92 NY2d 1035; People v Etheridge, 233 AD2d 626, lv denied 89 NY2d 921).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered February 28, 1985, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of one count of a two-count indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced to an indeterminate prison sentence of 816 to 25 years.
On this appeal defendant challenges the admission into evidence of tape recordings and transcripts of conversations between him and an informant, who was wired for sound by the police. Defendant contends that the recordings were insufficiently audible and, therefore, the submission to the jury of the recordings and their transcriptions was error. We find the contention without merit. The tapes were sufficiently audible and distinct to justify their admission (see, People v Sacchitella, 31 AD2d 180). Once audibility is established, it is within the trial court’s discretion whether to admit transcripts as an aid to the jury (see, People v Kuss, 81 AD2d 427, 429). County Court did not abuse its discretion in this case.
Defendant next challenges County Court’s Sandoval ruling respecting the use of two convictions of assault in the third degree, committed in 1980 and 1983, to challenge his veracity. The nature and extent of cross-examination are within the sound discretion of County Court. We cannot say that there was an abuse of discretion in the court’s Sandoval ruling. The evidence was of probative value on the issue of defendant’s credibility and was not so highly prejudicial as to require exclusion (see, People v Sandoval, 34 NY2d 371).
Finally, defendant challenges his sentence as unnecessarily harsh and excessive. We find no merit in this contention. Defendant’s lengthy record of transgressions fully justifies the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Clute, J.), rendered January 19, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a superior court information and other pending charges, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. In addition, defendant agreed to pay restitution and executed a waiver of his right to appeal in open court. Although the People agreed to recommend a sentence of two years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision, County Court informed defendant that it was making no commitment as to sentencing. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision and ordered him to pay restitution, including various surcharges. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid. Although “a trial court need not engage in any particular litany or catechism in satisfying itself that a defendant has entered a knowing, intelligent and voluntary appeal waiver, a trial court must make certain that a defendant’s understanding of the waiver ... is evident on the face of the record” (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Here, in view of the fleeting reference to defendant’s appeal waiver and absence of any acknowledgment by defendant that he understood the ramifications of the waiver, we cannot conclude that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see People v Burton, 93 AD3d 949, 949 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 958 [2012]).
Turning to the merits, given that the amount of restitution was explicitly included in the plea agreement and defendant did not object to that amount or request a hearing, his challenge to the restitution order is not preserved for our review (see People v Dishaw, 81 AD3d 1035, 1037 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]; People v Giovanni, 53 AD3d 778, 778-779 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 832 [2008]). Similarly, defendant’s challenge to the 10% restitution surcharge is not preserved absent an objection at sentencing (see People v Snyder, 38 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2007]). Finally, given defendant’s extensive criminal history and the fact that County Court informed defendant during the plea colloquy of the maximum potential sentence, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mosley, 87 AD3d 1179, 1179 [2011]; People v Qasem, 39 AD3d 960, 961 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J.), rendered June 22, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In March 2004, defendant was arrested and charged with, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony. Thereafter, defendant waived indictment and, pursuant to a superior court information, pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Defendant waived his right to appeal and, in June 2004, was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to a prison term of 5 to 15 years.
Initially, we find unavailing defendant’s claim that his waiver of his right to appeal did not preclude a challenge to the sentence imposed. “Where ... a defendant enters a guilty plea which the record reflects is knowing, voluntary and intelligent and includes a comprehensive waiver of the defendant’s right to appeal, the appeal waiver is enforceable and includes any challenge to the severity of the lawful sentence imposed” (People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9-11 [1989]). Here, the record reflects that defendant was repeatedly informed that the waiver included his right to challenge the sentence imposed and he specifically acknowledged that he was relinquishing that right. Accordingly, we find no basis to conclude that defendant’s waiver was anything less than all-encompassing (see People v Allen, supra at 763).
In any event, to the extent that defendant’s constitutional challenge to how he was sentenced survived his plea of guilty and the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Figueroa, 13 AD3d 163, 164 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 798 [2005]; People v Hidalgo, 283 AD2d 154 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 902 [2001]; People v Kinch, 237 AD2d 830, 831 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 860 [1997]), we are not persuaded that he is entitled to the requested relief. Specifically, defendant argues that the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738), signed into law after he was sentenced, violates his statutory and constitutional rights to equal protection by retroactively allowing individuals convicted of class A-I drug felonies prior to the Act’s effective date to petition for resentencing pursuant to a new determinate sentencing scheme (see L 2004, ch 738, § 23; see also Penal Law § 70.71), while not providing the same opportunity to persons convicted of class B felonies (see Penal Law § 70.70). Defendant’s challenge is lacking in merit inasmuch as there is a rational basis for distinguishing between class A-I and class B felony drug offenders for retroactivity purposes (see People v Walker, 81 NY2d 661, 668 [1993]; People v Parker, 41 NY2d 21, 25 [1976]). For example, it would be rational for the Legislature to allow retroactivity and extend the greatest relief to those facing the most stringent sentences while, at the same time, providing different retroactive relief to class B felony drug offenders by, among other things, granting eligibility to earn additional merit time reductions (see L 2004, ch 738, §§ 7, 8, 30; Legislative Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2004, ch 738). Given the existence of these and other factors demonstrating a rational basis for the disparity in treatment with respect to resentencing, we find defendant’s constitutional arguments unpersuasive.
Mercure, Peters, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ, concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
Given that defendant was already sentenced when the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act took effect and the legislation is not silent as to the issue of retroactivity, defendant’s claim that he is entitled to relief pursuant to the “amelioration doctrine” lacks merit (see People v Walker, 81 NY2d 661, 667 [1993]; People v Festo, 96 AD2d 765, 766 [1983], affd 60 NY2d 809 [1983]). Here, the Laws of 2004 (ch 738, § 41 [d-1]) specifically provide that the new sentencing ranges for class B offenders will “take effect on the thirtieth day after [the Act] shall have become a law, and . . . shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof.”",,733,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Keegan, J.), rendered January 8, 1992, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. She was arraigned on October 15, 1991 and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. On December 11, 1991, defendant was present in County Court for the apparent purpose of changing her plea to guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the entire indictment, with the understanding that she would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. During this plea proceeding defendant requested an adjournment of one week to give her more time to think about the plea. County Court denied her request and, after conferring with her attorney, conducted the plea allocution and accepted her guilty plea.
At her sentencing on January 8, 1992 defendant, through her counsel, requested permission to withdraw her plea of. guilty on various grounds including ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court then gave defendant an opportunity to speak and defendant said that she felt that she was not told ""a lot of my rights” by her attorney ""so that’s one reason why I’m withdrawing my plea. Also, my co-defendant got lesser time than I got. And I was not guilty in this case. And I’m not guilty”. The court interrupted, reminding defendant of her plea, and defendant replied that she felt that she was pressured because she was told by the court that day that if she did not accept the plea offer the trial would start immediately. After further discussion County Court found that although defendant was unhappy with what had occurred, her unhappiness was not a ground for withdrawal of the plea and denied the motion. County Court then imposed sentence despite defendant’s protestations. This appeal ensued.
The indictment followed the stopping of defendant at about 1:00 a.m. on August 28, 1991 when she was driving a rented automobile with two passengers on the Thruway at an alleged 80 miles per hour. A State Trooper found some narcotics and arrested one passenger for possession of narcotics. Another Trooper, upon executing a consensual search, found a paper bag purportedly containing a controlled substance, later claimed to be cocaine, in the rear passenger area. All three of the vehicle’s occupants were then arrested.
Defendant’s contention that she did not understand that she was waiving her right to appeal at the plea proceeding, and therefore she did not make a knowing, intelligent, voluntary and enforceable waiver of her right to appeal, is rejected (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039, 1040). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.
Defense counsel stated in open court that he had explained to defendant certain things involved in the plea agreement, including that ""she would be waiving her right to trial and all the rights attached thereto * * * and additionally she would have to forego any motions she could have made in this case and forego her right to appeal process”. In the plea allocution County Court asked defendant whether, ""[i]n consideration of this negotiated plea and sentence do you * * * waive your right to any hearings, trials, appeals or other proceedings in this matter”, and she answered in the affirmative. The record does not support the assertion that she was confused concerning the waiver of her right to appeal. Defendant’s criminal record indicates that she was not a stranger to criminal proceedings but, rather, was familiar with the plea-bargaining process. Defendant, by her waiver of her right to appeal, has waived any alleged deficiencies in the plea proceedings (see, People v Brown, supra, at 1040).

After defendant made three separate sales of marihuana and one sale of hydrocodone to an undercover police officer, a warrant was obtained to search defendant’s residence, where the State Police found, among other things, approximately 10 pounds of marihuana. Thereafter, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of marihuana in the first degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to all three counts of the indictment and, during the course of the plea allocution, he executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms, resulting in an aggregate sentence of three years. He now appeals, challenging the denial of his suppression motion and the sentenced imposed.
Notably, defendant does not challenge the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal. Viewing the record in its totality, we find that “County Court’s admonitions, together with the written waiver in the record, sufficiently informed defendant of his rights” (People v Lewis, 48 AD3d 880, 881 [2008]; see People v Giovanni, 53 AD3d 778, 778 [2008]). In light of defendant’s valid appeal waiver, he is now foreclosed from challenging the denial of his suppression motion (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Collins, 53 AD3d 932, 933 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 831 [2008]), as well his “contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive” (People v Clark, 52 AD3d 951, 952 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 831 [2008]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, as well as a pending robbery charge and any other drug charges within Saratoga County. In exchange for defendant’s guilty plea, he was promised a prison sentence of 7V2 years plus a period of postrelease supervision between 2V2 and 5 years. Following defendant’s plea, County Court imposed sentence in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, setting the period of postrelease supervision at five years. Thereafter, counsel for defendant advised the court that the period of postrelease supervision authorized by law was actually between IV2 and 3 years and defendant moved to withdraw his plea. County Court denied defendant’s motion to withdraw the plea and resentenced him to a period of postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant argues that he was denied due process because he was not properly advised of the duration of the applicable period of postrelease supervision at the time he entered his guilty plea. We disagree. It is clear that “a defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the post-release supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alterna tive courses of action” (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]; accord People v Hill, 9 NY3d 189, 191 [2007], cert denied 553 US 1048 [2008]; People v Rivera, 51 AD3d 1267, 1268 [2008]). Here, as required by People v Catu (supra), defendant was advised that he would be subjected to a period of postrelease supervision between 2V2 and 5 years. In fact, the legally authorized period of postrelease supervision was between IV2 and 3 years. Inasmuch as the duration of the postrelease supervision authorized by law and ultimately imposed fell within the range of which defendant was advised and to which he agreed at the time he entered his plea, we find that defendant’s plea was a knowing, voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives, and County Court properly denied his motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Sheils, 288 AD2d 504, 505 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 733 [2002]; compare People v Miller, 62 AD3d 1047, 1048 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Catena, J.), rendered March 30, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with various drug-related crimes arising from his possession and sale of cocaine at a residence located at 125 McClellan Street in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County. He pleaded guilty to the first count of an indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and a superior court information charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of all charges. He also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years, to run consecutive to a sentence imposed in connection with a prior felony conviction. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Lambe, 282 AD2d 776, 777; People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, 832, lv denied 95 NY2d 966). Despite defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution, his factual recitation does not negate an essential element of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty so as to constitute an exception to the preservation requirement (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636). Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits, the record discloses that defendant’s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. County Court gave defendant a detailed explanation of the rights he would be relinquishing by pleading guilty and defendant indicated that he understood them, was not coerced or threatened into pleading guilty and was satisfied with his attorney. County Court proceeded to question defendant regarding the specifics of each crime and, in our view, defendant’s responses adequately established the factual elements of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty (see, People v Kemp, supra at 636; People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806, 807, lv denied 97 NY2d 686).
Furthermore, we reject defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Given that defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and was on parole for a prior drug-related felony conviction at the time of the instant charges, we perceive no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see, People v Lambe, supra at 777; People v Hines, 277 AD2d 504, 505, lv denied 96 NY2d 759).

The defendant pleaded guilty to that crime and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 71 months.
The defendant challenged his status as a second felony offender, contending that his prior federal conviction did not con stitute a felony under New York State law. The County Court, in a written decision, determined that “the People have failed to prove that the conduct proscribed by 21 USC 841 (a) (1) and 846, would necessarily constitute the Felony of Conspiracy in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Degree under the applicable laws of the State of New York,” on the ground that the federal indictment did not allege that the defendant conspired to “sell” the cocaine. We disagree.
The defendant’s federal conviction is the equivalent of a conviction under New York law of the crime of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a class E felony (see Penal Law § 105.10 [1]). A person is guilty of conspiracy in the fourth degree under Penal Law § 105.10 (1) when he or she agrees with one or more persons to commit a class B or class C felony. The underlying crime under New York law is defined in Penal Law § 220.16 (1), possession of a narcotic drug with intent to sell it, which is a class B felony. The term “distribute” in 21 USC § 841 (a) (1) is the equivalent of the term “sell” under the New York Penal Law (see People v Rexach, 220 AD2d 362; People v Vasquez, 167 AD2d 236; Hendley v Clark, 147 AD2d 347, 349). Cocaine is a narcotic drug listed in Schedule II (b) (4) of Public Health Law § 3306 (see Penal Law § 220.00 [7]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered March 15, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant contends that it is unclear whether the sentence provided for in the plea bargain relates to, inter alia, a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, filed in December 1995, as well as to a pending petit larceny charge. Defendant contends that because of this ambiguity, this Court cannot make a determination as to whether defendant’s sentence was harsh and excessive. A review of the record indicates, however, that County Court explicitly stated that, among other things' all of the pending charges from December 1995 would be satisfied upon defendant entering a plea of guilty to the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, but that the charge of petit larceny was not a part of the plea bargain. In light of County Court’s statements, we find that there was no ambiguity regarding which charges were satisfied by defendant’s plea of guilty. Moreover, the record reveals that defendant showed no sign of confusion but, rather, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement (see, People v Di Rose, 210 AD2d 700, lv denied 85 NY2d 937).
While defendant contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive and requests this Court to reduce it in the interest of justice, a review of the record reveals that defendant’s sentence was agreed upon and within the statutory guidelines. Addition ally, given defendant’s history of criminal conduct we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of defendant’s sentence; accordingly, we will not disturb it.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered February 5, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and forgery in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and forgery in the second degree in full satisfaction of a five-count indictment and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him pursuant to the plea agreement to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7½ years, with three years of postrelease supervision. Following defendant’s appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence on the ground that County Court had inadvertently failed to pronounce sentence on each of the two counts (People v Volfson, 69 AD3d 1123, 1125 [2010]). Thereafter, County Court resentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years on the forgery count and Ph years in prison on the criminal possession of marihuana count, to be followed by three years postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant contends that County Court erred in not ordering a CPL article 730 competency hearing prior to resentencing him. We disagree. It is well established that “[a] defendant is presumed to be competent and is not entitled, as a matter of law, to a competency hearing unless the court has reasonable grounds to believe that, because of mental disease or defect, the defendant is incapable of assisting in his or her own defense or of understanding the proceedings against him [or her]” (People v Planty, 238 AD2d 806, 807 [1997], lv denied 89 NY2d 1098 [1997]). Here, the record reveals that defense counsel informed County Court prior to the resentencing hearing that, in her opinion, defendant was unfit to proceed and requested that the court order a competency hearing, but then counsel withdrew the request at the hearing. Further, while defendant’s statements during the resentencing hearing were argumentative and disruptive, they were not, in our view, indicative of a mental impairment requiring a competency hearing (see People v Kulakov, 72 AD3d 1271, 1272 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 775 [2010]; People v Daley, 302 AD2d 745, 746 [2003]). Finally, defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes his challenge to the severity of the agreed-upon sentence (see People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Monroe, J.), rendered September 2, 1983, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On September 24, 1982, defendant sold 27.62 grams of cocaine. As a result of that sale, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, on the condition that she could submit a motion to the sentencing court asking that the statutory mandatory prison sentence (Penal Law § 70.00) not be applied in her case. County Court denied defendant’s motion and sentenced defendant to the minimum mandatory sentence of 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment. This appeal ensued.
Defendant’s first contention is that her situation is one of the ""rare cases” envisioned in People v Broadie (37 NY2d 100, 119, cert denied 423 US 950) where application of the mandatory prison sentence is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment. This contention is without merit. Although the incident in question was defendant’s first criminal offense, other than a shoplifting charge which was adjourned in contemplation of dismissal in 1977, and defendant is a widow who supports her six-year-old child, the fact remains that defendant admitted knowingly agreeing to participate in a drug transaction in order to make money. The facts underlying the crime were that defendant participated in the sale of 27.62 grams of cocaine for $2,600. Under the circumstances, County Court correctly denied defendant’s request that the mandatory prison sentence not be imposed.
Finally, defendant contends that CPL 220.10 and 220.30 (3) (b) (viii) violate her due process rights because the statutes restricted her ability to plea bargain based on the level of the crime charged. In this regard, a defendant charged with a class A-II drug felony may not be allowed to plead guilty to any charge lower than a class B felony (CPL 220.10, 220.30 [3] [b] [viii]). A defendant, however, has no right to plead guilty except to the entire indictment (People v Felix, 87 AD2d 529, 531 [Lupiano, J., concurring], affd 58 NY2d 156, appeal dismissed 464 US 802; see, CPL 220.10 [1]). Therefore, the Legislature may properly limit the level down to which a defendant may plead guilty (see, People v Felix, 58 NY2d 156, 162, n 3). In this case, defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged and she was sentenced in accordance with the constraints of the sentencing provision of the lesser charge (see, Penal Law § 70.00). The judgment should be affirmed.

"from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered July 13, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of two pending indictments. As agreed, he was sentenced as a second felony drug offender to an aggregate prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of two years. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the severity of his sentence.
We affirm. Defendant’s criminal history includes another drug-related offense and robbery in the first degree. As the negotiated sentence was less than the maximum permitted and substantially less than his sentencing exposure had he been convicted of all counts after trial, we are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive (see People v Holman, 53 AD3d 775, 776 [2008]; People v Wallach, 35 AD3d 913, 914 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered February 15, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and endangering the welfare of a child.
As a result of two cocaine transactions in the City of Hudson, Columbia County, defendant was charged with various drug-related crimes, as well as endangering the welfare of a child. In full satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to three felony counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and a misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender to 6 to 12 years in prison for the felony convictions and a one-year jail term for the misdemeanor conviction, to run concurrently. This appeal ensued.
Defendant contends that because her competency was at issue, County Court erred in accepting her guilty plea without first following the procedures set forth in CPL 730.20. We disagree. It is well settled that “whenever a court has a ‘reasonable ground for believing that a defendant is in such state of idiocy, imbecility or insanity that he is incapable of understanding the charge, indictment or proceedings or of making his defense, it is the duty of the court to direct him to be examined in these respects’ ” (People v Tortorici, 92 NY2d 757, 765, cert denied 528 US 834, quoting People v Smyth, 3 NY2d 184, 187). A defendant, however, is presumed competent (see, People v Morgan, 87 NY2d 878, 880; People v Maldonado, 273 AD2d 537, 540, lv denied 95 NY2d 867) and “is not entitled, as a matter of right, to have the question of his capacity to stand trial passed upon * * *~if the court is satisfied from the available information that there is no proper basis for questioning the defendant’s sanity” (People v Armlin, 37 NY2d 167, 171; see, People v Horan, 290 AD2d 880, 882).
After defendant indicated in proceedings before County Court in January 2001 that she had been taking medication and was under the care of mental health professionals for manic depression the previous summer, the court adjourned the matter to give defense counsel an opportunity to obtain further information. When proceedings resumed, defense counsel provided the court with correspondence from two social workers who indicated, respectively, that no mental status abnormalities were present and that defendant was rational and coherent. Under these circumstances, we conclude that County
Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to go further and have defendant examined pursuant to CPL 730.20 (1) (see, People v Maldonado, supra at 540-541). Indeed, during the course of the plea colloquy, defendant responded capably to the questions put to her by County Court, evidenced no indication of mental impairment (see, People v Young, 257 AD2d 764, lv denied 93 NY2d 931) and proceeded to enter a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty. Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which to disturb the underlying plea. Likewise, given defendant’s criminal history and use of a 12-year-old child as a drug courier, we find that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive (see, People v Smith, 288 AD2d 693, lv denied 97 NY2d 761; People v Spann, 287 AD2d 880, 881).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered December 10, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted pursuant to a superior court information charging him with one count of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree. In return for his acceptance into the judicial diversion program, defendant pleaded guilty as charged (in full satisfaction of both the superior court information and another pending charge) and waived his right to appeal — both orally and in writing. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement and the judicial diversion contract executed by defendant, defendant was advised that, if he failed to complete the program, he could be sentenced as a second felony offender to a maximum period of 4V2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Following defendant’s two failed attempts at completing the program, the matter was set down for sentencing, and County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of four years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We reject defendant’s assertion that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. County Court explained the rights that defendant was forfeiting by pleading guilty and distinguished the right to appeal from the trial-related rights that defendant was forgoing; defendant, in turn, communicated his understanding thereof and signed a detailed written waiver in open court (see People v Jakob, 147 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]). “While the better practice would have been for the court to specifically ask defendant if he had discussed the appeal waiver with counsel and establish that he had read the written waiver before signing it, considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver, including defendant’s experience, we are satisfied that the oral colloquy, combined with the written waiver, demonstrate his understanding and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal” (People v Empey, 144 AD3d 1201, 1202-1203 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 1144 [2017]; see People v Lavalley, 150 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2017]). Accordingly, the valid waiver precludes defendant’s present claim that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice (see People v McRae, 150 AD3d 1328, 1328 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1093 [2017]; People v White, 96 AD3d 1299, 1300 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1029 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered April 13, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (three counts), conspiracy in the second degree (two counts) and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In this appeal, defendant pro se argues that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing him, in accord with the terms of the plea agreement, to concurrent prison terms of 8 Vs years to life on each of the criminal sale counts and 8 Vs to 25 years on the conspiracy counts. Defendant’s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738) seeking leave to withdraw as counsel on grounds that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal.
We agree. A review of the record establishes that the minimum term on the criminal sale convictions, i.e., 8 Vs years in prison, was less than the harshest possible, that defendant knew he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed and raised no objections to it at the time of sentencing. In light of this, along with the fact that the crimes to which defendant pleaded guilty establish his involvement in an ongoing criminal narcotics enterprise, we find no basis to disturb the sentences imposed (see, People v Porter, 197 AD2d 728; People v Gonzalez, 178 AD2d 850, lv denied 79 NY2d 948; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered.June 24, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substancé in the third degree.
Pursuant to the terms of a plea bargain agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for an agreed-upon prison term of 3 to 9 years. At the plea hearing, County Court ordered defendant released on bail but advised him that his failure to appear for sentencing would void the plea agreement, thereby exposing him to a possible enhanced sentence of up to 8V3 to 25 years in prison. When defendant failed to appear at the scheduled sentencing hearing, a bench warrant was issued which led to his arrest several months later. Upon defendant’s return, County Court sentenced him to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. Defendant’s appeal was held in abeyance and new counsel assigned after this Court determined that there were nonfrivolous appealable issues to be raised (279 AD2d 798).
Defendant now appeals solely contending that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice, given that this conviction is his first offense. While we are mindful that defendant has no prior criminal history, he stands convicted of a serious crime and has committed the additional crime of bail jumping despite County Court’s warning that his failure to appear for sentencing could result in an enhanced sentence. Under these circumstances and given that the sentence ultimately imposed was measurably shorter than the maximum allowable under the law (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; 13] [b]), we conclude that the sentence was appropriate and we decline to disturb it in the interest of justice (see, People v Morton, 275 AD2d 865, 866; People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713, 714).

"On or about June 28, 1989, the defendant was charged with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree in connection with the sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer. On December 4, 1989, after lengthy plea negotiations in which the defendant endeavored to secure the District Attorney’s recommendation for a sentence of lifetime probation, he agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in exchange for a commitment to impose sentence of an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment, the minimum period of incarceration permitted upon a conviction of a class A-II felony.
During the plea allocution, the defendant admitted that he had, while acting with another, sold a quantity of cocaine in excess of two ounces to an undercover police officer. The defendant’s attorney asked the court to defer formal acceptance of the plea because he wished to have his client continue cooperating with law enforcement authorities, and wanted to leave open the possibility that the District Attorney would recommend a sentence of lifetime probation. Since all believed that formal acceptance of the plea required the revocation of the defendant’s bail status pursuant to CPL 530.40 (3), the court, with the consent of the People, agreed to defer formal acceptance of the plea in order to give the defendant the opportunity to continue providing assistance to the police. The matter was adjourned to January 9, 1990, to allow the People to monitor the level of assistance provided by the defendant.
On January 9, 1990, the District Attorney advised the court and the defendant that the level of cooperation had been insufficient and would not result in a recommendation of lifetime probation (see, People v D’Amico, 147 Misc 2d 731, 734). At this time, the defendant requested an adjournment to put his affairs in order but did not move to vacate his plea. Prior to sentencing on July 2, 1990, the undercover officer involved in the sale with the defendant was murdered. The defendant then took the position that a valid plea was never entered and that he was entitled to a trial of the original charges. Alternatively, he moved to vacate the plea in the interests of justice. By decision and order dated May 17, 1990, the court denied the motion, concluding that a valid plea had been offered. The plea was thereupon formally accepted. On July 2, 1990, the court imposed sentence in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v D’Amico, supra).
The defendant waived his claim that there was a defect in the proceedings, since the formal acceptance of his plea was deferred at his specific request (cf., People v D’Amico, 150 AD2d 276, 279-280, affd 76 NY2d 877). In any event, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the plea was validly offered at the plea allocution on December 4, 1989. At that time, the defendant expressly agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree based upon a commitment to impose sentence of an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment. At his lawyer’s request, formal acceptance of the plea was deferred so that the defendant might remain at liberty in the hope that he would be able to assist the police in such a significant manner that a sentence of lifetime proba tion would be recommended. The court’s action in temporarily deferring formal acceptance of the plea was for the limited purpose of giving the defendant the additional time at liberty that he sought. It did not vitiate the validity and enforceability of the plea agreement. The defendant received the benefit of the promises that were made on December 4, 1989. After the defendant failed to meet the condition for imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation, the court properly acted to formally accept his plea, and thereupon to impose a sentence of three years to life imprisonment in accordance with the original plea agreement (cf., People v Gordon, 162 AD2d 343). The court properly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Jones, 44 NY2d 76, 81, cert denied 439 US 846). Kunzeman, J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Loyola, J.), rendered July 9, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with offenses stemming from his alleged sale of cocaine to a police informant on two occasions six days apart. He engaged in pretrial motion practice that included, among other things, applications to suppress the informant’s identification of him to police and place him in the Judicial Diversion Program. After that relief was denied, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal. As contemplated by the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to five years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Upon our review of the thorough plea colloquy and the detailed written waiver executed by defendant, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1489-1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]). Defendant is accordingly precluded from arguing that County Court erred in refusing to either suppress identification evidence (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]) or grant him judicial diversion (see People v Brown, 122 AD3d 1006, 1007 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]).
Defendant also challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, while that issue survives his appeal waiver, the apparent lack of an appropriate postallocution motion leaves it unpreserved for our review (see People v Mann, 140 AD3d 1532, 1533 [2016]; People v White, 139 AD3d 1260, 1260 [2016]). Despite defendant’s protestations to the contrary, nothing was said during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea so as to implicate the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Austin, 141 AD3d 956, 957 [2016]).
Defendant next contends that the indictment was jurisdic-tionally defective which, unlike his speculation that deficiencies might be found in the grand jury minutes, survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230-231 [2000]; People v Rapp, 133 AD3d 979, 979-980 [2015]). The indictment was jurisdictionally valid, however, as the count to which defendant pleaded guilty recited the specific section of the Penal Law under which he was charged and did not need to specify the exact subset of cocaine he sold (see People v Rapp, 133 AD3d at 980; People v Moon, 119 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1004 [2014]).
The claims advanced by defendant in his pro se supplemental brief largely echo those raised by appellate counsel and addressed above. To the extent that they do not, we have examined them and found them to be without merit.

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered March 4, 1998, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
On January 11, 1995, defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a. controlled substance in the fifth degree and sentenced to six months in jail and probation. On January 26, 1998, a violation petition was filed after defendant was arrested and charged with, inter alia, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The charge was based on allegations that defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover investigator on July 15, 1997. A hearing ensued following which County Court concluded that defendant violated his probation. The court subsequently revoked probation and sentenced defendant to 2V3 to 7 years in prison, prompting this appeal.
We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that he was denied due process because the probation violation hearing was held before the criminal trial on the underlying charge. Initially, defense counsel never sought an adjournment of the hearing on any ground nor did he object to the sequence of the proceedings (compare, People v Hilton, 179 Misc 2d 538; People v Davis, 161 Misc 2d 533); thus, this issue is not preserved for our review (see, People v Powell, 209 AD2d 645, 646, lv denied 85 NY2d 865; see also, CPL 470.05 [2]; see generally, People ex rel. Matthews v New York State Div. of Parole, 58 NY2d 201, 204-205). Even if we were to consider the argument in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [a]), we would find it to be without merit.
In arguing that the violation hearing should have been adjourned until after the trial on the underlying charge, defendant claims that his right to confront witnesses was compromised and that had there been an acquittal in the criminal action, a different result may have been reached by County Court in the instant matter. With respect to this latter point, we note simply that probation may be revoked even though there has been an acquittal or dismissal of criminal charges (see, People v Powell, supra; see also, People v Schneider, 188 AD2d 754, 757, lv denied 81 NY2d 892; compare, CPL 410.70 [3], with CPL 300.10). With respect to the former point, because the investigator who purchased the drugs from defendant testified at the hearing and defense counsel was given ample opportunity to cross-examine her, defendant was not deprived of his right to confrontation (cf., People ex rel. McGee v Walters, 62 NY2d 317). Because no principle of law required resolution of the violation hearing in this case to await resolution of the underlying criminal charge (see, People ex rel. Brooks v Russi, 237 AD2d 394, 395, lv denied 90 NY2d 801; People v Powell, supra; People v Davis, supra, at 535; compare, People v Spears, 64 NY2d 698; People ex rel. Piccarillo v New York State Bd. of Parole, 48 NY2d 76; People v Norris, 190 AD2d 871), we are unpersuaded that defense counsel’s failure to request an adjournment rendered his assistance ineffective. Rather, upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that defendant was in fact provided with meaningful representation at the hearing (see, e.g., People v Griffith, 239 AD2d 705, 707).
Defendant’s remaining contentions, including his claim that the People failed to prove he violated the conditions of his probation by a preponderance of the evidence and that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, have been reviewed and found to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered January 9,1984, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
On this appeal, defendant contends, first, that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive and, second, that the imposition of a mandatory surcharge was violative of his constitutional equal protection rights for the reason that he was indigent. The first contention is apparently bottomed on the fact that, in spite of his assurance of complete cooperation in any further related investigation or prosecution, he was not granted his hoped-for sentence of lifetime probation as permitted by section 65.00 of the Penal Law. Defendant contends that because he promised to cooperate, he was entitled to that sentence and the trial court’s failure to impose it was an abuse of discretion. This view overlooks the fact that one of the predicates for such a disposition is a recommendation from the District Attorney. No such recommendation was made, promised for or suggested in any manner in the plea bargain agreement, which specifically and unequivocally called for a sentence with a minimum of three years and a maximum of life imprisonment. Nor was there any mention of such a disposition in the extended colloquies between defendant and the court. In addition, no extraordinary circumstances evincing an abuse of discretion have been demonstrated which would warrant our interference with the sentence imposed (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 305; People v Miller, 74 AD2d 961).
We likewise find no merit to defendant’s second contention. This court has recently concluded that section 60.35 of the Penal Law was a constitutionally permissible enactment by the Legislature (People v Dodson, 96 AD2d 1116, 1118).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered September 6, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The plea agreement contemplated that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender and would receive a determinate prison term of between 6 and 12 years, to be followed by a term of postrelease supervision. County Court ultimately sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years to be followed by postrelease supervision of three years, that sentence to run consecutively to a prison sentence he was already serving. Defendant now appeals, arguing solely that the sentence was harsh and excessive.
We disagree and affirm. It is well settled that “[a] sentence that falls within the permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that the sentencing court abused its discretion or that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification in the interest of justice” (People v Pailin, 306 AD2d 558, 558 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 597 [2003]; see People v McCombs, 83 AD3d 1296, 1296 [2011]). The sentence here was within the permissible statutory range and, after reviewing the seriousness of the offense, defendant’s prior criminal history and the fact that the sentence was both within the negotiated range and well below the statutory maximum, we discern no circumstances that would warrant its modification (see People v Davis, 83 AD3d 1210, 1213 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 794 [2011]; People v Wilson, 78 AD3d 1213, 1217 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 747 [2011]).

"Crew III, J. P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered May 12, 1995, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant, having been found by a jury to have supplied Richard Pierre with one pound of marihuana which Pierre, in turn, sold to an undercover police officer and his informant, was convicted of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree and sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years. We agree with defendant’s that proof that Pierre previously obtained marihuana from him on three or four unspecified occasions for unspecified reasons bore no relationship to the particular crime with which he was charged and was not necessary to complete the narrative of events. Consequently, the admission of such proof constituted error. We nevertheless affirm because our review of the record convinces us that proof of defendant’s complicity here was so overwhelming that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (see, People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230). Defendant’s remaining contention—that his sentence was harsh and excessive—has been examined and found to be lacking in merit.

"Mahoney, P. J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered September 1, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of five counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to five reduced charges of second degree criminal sale of a controlled substance. This plea was in full satisfaction of five separate indictments charging him with first degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and an unindicted charge of assault stemming from an incident while defendant was in jail. Defendant was subsequently sentenced to five concurrent prison terms of nine years to life. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant initially argues that he was denied due process by County Court’s failure to order a hearing to determine his mental competence. Such a hearing, however, must be premised on an objective determination by the court that a reasonable ground exists to doubt defendant’s competence (see, Peo ple v Gensler, 72 NY2d 239, 245, cert denied 488 US 932; People v Armlin, 37 NY2d 167, 168). Here, both the plea colloquy and sentencing minutes fail to proffer any objective indication that County Court erred in not ordering a hearing. We note further that, between the entering of his guilty plea and sentencing, defendant was sent to a psychiatric center by authorities at the County Jail, apparently in response to a perceived suicide risk. Defendant was released therefrom and, at the time of sentencing, the court took notice of a psychiatric report rendered on defendant’s discharge which stated that defendant was alert, fully oriented, cooperative and exhibiting ""no psychotic thinking”. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb the court’s ruling in this regard (see, People v Carbone, 159 AD2d 511, lv denied, 76 NY2d 732).
We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find all to lack merit. As noted in the People’s brief on appeal, however, defendant was erroneously sentenced on his conviction for class A-II felonies (Penal Law § 220.41 [7]) to a minimum term of imprisonment of nine years despite the statutory ceiling therefor of eight years and four months (Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). The sentence should therefore be reduced (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 238, cert denied 419 US 1122; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d 920). Although we generally remit cases where a plea is entered in return for a bargained-for sentence later revealed as unlawful (see, People v West, 80 AD2d 680, 681), in this instance we choose to correct the sentence in accordance with the lawful minimum (see, CPL 470.15 [4] [c]).

"Waiving his right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to 10 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, challenging his sentence on two separate grounds.
First, defendant asserts that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender because County Court failed to comply with the requirements of CPL 400.21. That claim, however, is unpreserved for our review in light of defendant’s failure to raise the appropriate objection at the time of sentencing (see People v Clark, 54 AD3d 1099, 1099-1100 [2008]). As for defendant’s second contention, that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive, defendant’s appeal waiver precludes him from advancing such a claim (see People v Getter, 52 AD3d 1117, 1118 [2008]).

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Harkavy, J.), rendered May 9, 1995, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, crimi nally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts), and criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing concurrent sentences of an indeterminate term of 20 years to life imprisonment on the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, an indeterminate term of 5 to 15 years imprisonment on the conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and a determinate term of one year imprisonment on each of the convictions of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree. This appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant’s omnibus motion which were to suppress statements to law enforcement authorities and physical evidence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the sentence imposed for criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree from one year to three months imprisonment; and as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant contends that the People failed to prove a voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights because the police failed to ask him whether, having been apprised of his rights, he was still willing to answer questions. However, because the defendant failed to raise this specific contention at the hearing or in his motion papers, this issue is unpreserved for appellate review (see, People v Tutt, 38 NY2d 1011; People v Alexander, 226 AD2d 548). In any event, an implicit waiver was established on this record (see, People v Sirno, 76 NY2d 967). The circumstances surrounding the defendant’s admissions to police do not indicate that his admissions were coerced (cf., People v Anderson, 42 NY2d 35).
The maximum term of imprisonment upon a conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree is three months (Penal Law §§ 221.10, 70.15 [2]). Therefore, the determinate term of one year imprisonment imposed upon that conviction is reduced to three months. The sentence was not otherwise excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).

"Aarons, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered April 25, 2014, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In December 2013, while on parole release, defendant was arrested and charged in an 11-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and conspiracy in the fourth degree (three counts). In March 2014, defendant, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement that required her to, among other things, execute a waiver of appeal, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of seven years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, while the negotiated plea agreement required defendant to execute a waiver of appeal, our review of the record reveals that County Court failed to explain the significance of an appeal waiver or convey that it is “separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Bates, 146 AD3d 1075, 1075 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d 1250, 1250 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]). Although defendant acknowledged that she understood that the plea agreement required her to execute a waiver of appeal whereby she would waive certain appellate rights, the record neither contains a written waiver of appeal signed by defendant nor reflects that any inquiry was made as to whether she had read such a waiver and understood it (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the waiver of appeal was invalid and does not preclude defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or her challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed.
Defendant argues that her guilty plea was involuntary because it was induced by unfulfilled promises regarding the length of her sentence and that she would be admitted into a correctional facility wherein she could have given birth to her child and purportedly remained with that child for 18 months thereafter. While “[a] guilty plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored” (People v Collier, 22 NY3d 429, 433 [2013] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], cert denied 573 US —, 134 S Ct 2730 [2014]; see People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Roberts, 293 AD2d 916, 917 [2002]), the record does not establish any of defendant’s allegations. Defendant indicated that she understood the terms of the plea agreement—which did not specify the correctional facility to which she would be assigned or indicate whether she would receive additional confinement for having violated parole—and requested that County Court adhere to its terms. Defendant also expressed that, among other things, she had been given enough time to discuss her plea with her counsel and her family members, that she was voluntarily giving up her trial-related rights and that she understood that she would be allowed to withdraw her plea if County Court decided to deviate from the proposed sentence after reviewing the pre-sentence report. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the minutes of the plea colloquy amply refute any claim of off-the-record promises allegedly made to defendant that are not entitled to judicial recognition (see Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116, 120 [1982]; People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 526 [1978]; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d at 244; People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; People v Crowell, 130 AD3d 1362, 1363 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1144 [2016], cert denied 580 US —, 137 S Ct 1333 [2017]). In addition, to the extent that defendant’s contentions are based upon off-the-record communications between defendant and counsel or her parole officer, they are not properly addressed in this direct appeal (see People v Fairweather, 147 AD3d 1153, 1154 [2017]; People v Lewis, 143 AD3d 1183, 1185 [2016]).
With regard to defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, even if we were to agree with defendant’s contention that her counsel’s performance was deficient for failing to advise her of or request judicial diversion under the program created by CPL article 216, whether an eligible defendant will be offered judicial diversion pursuant to that article remains within the trial court’s discretion, and defendant is not automatically entitled to judicial diversion (see People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; cf. People v Pittman, 140 AD3d 989, 989 [2016]; People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1383 [2013]). Moreover, the record reflects that defendant’s counsel negotiated a favorable plea agreement whereby defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an 11-count indictment and in exchange for the People’s promise to not bring additional charges for the discovery of narcotics within defendant’s home when she was arrested by parole officers. Accordingly, in light of the foregoing and defendant’s express acknowledgment during the plea colloquy that she was satisfied with counsel’s representation, we conclude that defendant received meaningful representation and that nothing in the record before us casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see People v Ramos, 135 AD3d 1234, 1235 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 935 [2016]; People v Lord, 128 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2015]; People v Ramey, 123 AD3d 1290, 1290-1291 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 953 [2015]).
Although, as noted above, defendant’s challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is not precluded by the invalid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]; People v Lloyd, 142 AD3d at 1250), we do not find that the sentence is harsh or excessive. Notwithstanding defendant’s purported eligibility for judicial diversion, as well as her age, mental health issues and then-pregnancy, County Court imposed the sentence that defendant expressly agreed to receive in exchange for her guilty plea. Thus, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Ramirez, 98 AD3d 1168, 1168 [2012]; People v Lasanta, 89 AD3d 1324, 1324 [2011]; People v Jones, 257 AD2d 920, 920 [1999]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered January 28, 1974, upon verdicts convicting defendant of two counts of criminally selling a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of subdivision 1 of section 220.39 of the Penal Law and sentencing him to two consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment of seven years to life. On this appeal, the defendant makes numerous arguments, two of which have been previously rejected by this court. Thus, his challenge to the constitutionality of section 70.00 of the Penal Law, pursuant to which he was sentenced, has been found wanting (People v. Venable, 46 A D 2d 73), as has his complaint that the trial court should have directed the prosecution to produce police informant, Daniel Jerome Powell, as a witness (People v. Fowler, 46 A D 2d 838; People v. Hood, 46 A D 2d 837). His remaining contentions are also without merit. The court’s refusal to grant a continuance to allow the defendant to produce Powell as a witness was within its discretionary power (People v. Torre, 33 A D 2d 43) which was properly exercised here where there was no showing that the defendant would be able to- produce Powell or that his testimony would exculpate the defendant' as claimed. Likewise, the chain of evidence with regard to the possession of the narcotics by the police was adequately established (ef. People v. Connelly, 35 N Y 2d 171), and the imposition of consecutive sentences was within the competence of the court (ef. People v. Thiel, 25 N Y 2d 926). As to the cross-examination of Trooper James Werthmuller and Investigator Michael Elliot, there was no showing that the limitations placed thereon by the trial court prejudiced the defendant. Finally, the defendant’s former status as a police informant, to which the prosecutor alluded in his summation when questioning whether the defendant was worthy of belief, was brought out on direct examination by the defendant’s own attorney who made no objection to the prosecutor’s remarks at trial.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered February 6, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and conspiracy in the second degree.
An indictment charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree (count one), two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (counts two and four), and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (counts three and five) as the result of her participation in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Defendant disposed of the indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to conspiracy in the second degree, as charged in the first count, and to counts three and five of the indictment, each as reduced to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The guilty pleas were entered with the express understanding, stated upon the record in open court, that defendant would be sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 6 years to life and 5 years to life on the criminal possession counts, and a concurrent term of SVs to 25 years on the conspiracy count. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals.
We affirm. The majority of defendant’s arguments are unpreserved for our review by virtue of defendant’s failure to move to withdraw her guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Mackey, 77 NY2d 846; People v Snow, 253 AD2d 985, lv denied 93 NY2d 858) and are found to lack merit in any event. Notably, a defendant who accepts a plea bargain surrenders the right to make a subsequent challenge to the factual basis for the plea (see, People v Rivera, 266 AD2d 576; People v Morelli, 228 AD2d 818, lv denied 88 NY2d 990) and there was nothing in defendant’s plea allocution that would have given notice of an available agency defense or otherwise cast doubt upon defendant’s guilt or the voluntariness of her plea (see, People v Thompkins, 233 AD2d 759, 760; cf., People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676-677).
Further, the record is devoid of evidence supporting defendant’s claims of unreasonable delay in sentencing or denial of effective assistance of counsel. In the latter regard, we note that the test to be applied in the case of a guilty plea, i.e., whether there is an advantageous plea and an absence of record evidence casting doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404), has been satisfied. As a final matter, we are not persuaded to disturb the bargained-for sentence, which was well within the applicable sentencing parameters.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Dwyer, Jr., J.), rendered January 30, 1991, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
On March 20, 1989, defendant entered a plea of guilty to fifth degree criminal sale of the controlled substance cocaine. He was sentenced as a predicate felon to a term of imprisonment of 2 Vi to 5 years. On appeal, this court vacated defendant’s sentence and remitted the matter to County Court because ""defendant was not adequately informed of his right to challenge any statement regarding a predicate felony conviction as required by CPL 400.21” (168 AD2d 745, 746). Upon remittal, defendant controverted the validity of his previous felony conviction by alleging that it was procured in violation of his constitutional right to counsel. Despite defendant’s request for a hearing and for the minutes of his previous plea allocutions, County Court sentenced defendant as a predicate felon to a prison term of 2 Vi to 5 years. This appeal followed.
Defendant contends that it was error to deny his request for a hearing on his challenge to the previous felony conviction. We agree. Defendant was entitled to a hearing (see, CPL 400.21 [5]; People v Longboat, 154 AD2d 916; People v Allen, 135 AD2d 1034, 1035). We reject the People’s argument on appeal that County Court’s plea colloquy satisfied the hearing requirement, particularly in view of defendant’s request for the minutes of his previous plea allocution (see, People v Gonzalez, 108 AD2d 622, 623-624; cf., People v De Vorce, 115 AD2d 553, 554).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered September 11, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The People recommended that defendant, a second felony offender, be sentenced to a prison term of six years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court ultimately imposed the recommended sentence, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel but, as he concedes, he did not preserve that issue by way of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Kerwin, 117 AD3d 1097, 1097-1098 [2014]). In any case, defense counsel entered into a stipulation in lieu of motions that provided for discovery and various pretrial hearings, and there is no indication that proceeding by that route affected defendant’s decision to plead guilty (see People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1200-1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013]). Defense counsel went on to negotiate a plea agreement that significantly limited defendant’s sentencing exposure, and defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he had adequately discussed the terms of that agreement with counsel and was satisfied with counsel’s performance. Accordingly, were this issue preserved, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d 1080, 1081-1082 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 961 [2014]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1344 [2011]). Finally, to the extent that defendant contends that counsel failed to adequately meet with him prior to the plea colloquy, this claim implicates matters outside of the record and, as such, is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1271 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]).

In satisfaction of a six-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Although defendant agreed to accept a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison as part of the plea bargain, he was ultimately sentenced to a term of 4 to 12 years in prison after he failed to appear at sentencing. Upon review of the record, we reject defendant’s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant was given Parker warnings at the time he entered his plea and offered no reasonable excuse for his failure to appear at sentencing. In view of this, as well as defendant’s criminal record and admitted involvement in drug-related activities, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s judgment.

Furthermore, the sentences were made to run concurrently. Given defendant’s previous criminal record and the fact that the sentence was less than the maximum which could have been imposed, his claim that the sentence was harsh and excessive is rejected (see, People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 15, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In satisfaction thereof, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree without any agreement being made as to sentence. Sentencing was adjourned for six months, during which time defendant was charged with another similar crime. He was ultimately sentenced to three years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective because he did not set forth on the record the mitigating factors that County Court should have considered with respect to sentencing. Although defense counsel did not specifically enumerate the mitigating factors at sentencing, he brought them to County Court’s attention during the plea proceedings and advocated for the imposition of a one-year jail term. Moreover, pertinent information concerning defendant’s past, including his substance abuse history, was set forth in the presentence investigation report provided to the court. In view of this, and considering that defendant received a favorable plea agreement exposing him to less prison time than he could have received had he been convicted after trial, we find that he was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Watson, 152 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2017], lv denied 30 NY3d 954 [2017]; People v Case, 139 AD3d 1239, 1240 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]). Given defendant’s prior convictions, his commis sion of another drug-related, offense while awaiting sentencing and the fact that no particular sentence was promised as part of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mondolfi, 309 AD2d 975, 975 [2003]).

"Aarons, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered December 9, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment and other then-pending charges, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a written waiver of appeal in open court. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a nonviolent predicate felony offender, a prison sentence of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we find that defendant’s oral and written waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 339-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). The record reflects that County Court distinguished the right to appeal as “separate and apart” from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea, and defendant acknowledged that he signed and understood the written appeal waiver after reviewing it and conferring with counsel regarding its contents (see People v Hall, 147 AD3d 1151, 1151 [2017]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017]). While defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives the appeal waiver, this claim was not preserved by an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1132 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015]; People v Waite, 120 AD3d 1446, 1447 [2014]), and defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that triggered the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 219-220 [2016]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Austin, 141 AD3d 956, 957 [2016]).
Defendant’s claim that the sentence was harsh and excessive is foreclosed by the valid appeal waiver (see People v Macon, 142 AD3d 739, 739 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1073 [2016]; People v Rushlow, 137 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2016]), which includes his “right to invoke [this Court’s] interest-of-justice jurisdiction to reduce the sentence” (People v Bethea, 133 AD3d 1033, 1033 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 27 NY3d 992 [2016]). To the extent that defendant raises a claim regarding what counsel investigated or discussed with him, this concerns a matter that is outside the record on appeal and is more properly suited for a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Daniels, 139 AD3d 1256, 1257 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1183 [2017]; People v Taylor, 135 AD3d 1237, 1238 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1075 [2016]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Lawliss, J.), rendered May 25, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was the subject of two criminal indictments. In satisfaction of the first, he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced on March 11, 1999 to a prison term of 2V2 to 7V2 years. In satisfaction of the second indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees. On May 25, 1999, County Court imposed two concurrent prison sentences of 5 to 15 years to run consecutively with the earlier sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years.
Defendant appeals from the second judgment of conviction arguing only that the sentences of 5 to 15 years were harsh and excessive and should, in any event, have been ordered to run concurrently with the earlier prison sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years. We disagree. Our review of the record herein convinces us that there are no extraordinary circumstances that would warrant modification of the sentences in the interest of justice (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, v denied 94 NY2d 917). At the time of his second arrest, defendant was out on bail awaiting trial of the first indictment. He was, nonetheless, found to be in possession of 63 baggies of crack cocaine. Given defendant’s history of involvement in criminal activities, both as an adult and as a juvenile offender, together with his continued participation in drug-related crimes despite prior periods of incarceration, we see no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by County Court (see, People v Moore, 270 AD2d 715, 716, lv denied 95 NY2d 800; People v Cooper, 258 AD2d 815, 816, lv denied 93 NY2d 1016).

In full satisfaction of a 12-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 10 to 20 years. On appeal, defendant contends that his guilty plea was involuntary and that the sentence was harsh and excessive. Although defendant stated during the plea allocution that he was coerced by “the system” and was concerned about the sentence he was facing, we nevertheless find that defendant’s guilty plea represented a knowing, voluntary and intelligent choice (see, People v Pressley, 241 AD2d 621; People v Rojas, 238 AD2d 727). Nor are we persuaded that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh or excessive. Defendant had been released on parole only five weeks when he committed the instant offense and, if convicted at trial, defendant would have been exposed to a much lengthier prison sentence (see, People v Feliciano, 240 AD2d 903). Finally, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed in the interest of justice.

"Devine, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered June 20, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal from the conviction and sentence. County Court imposed upon defendant, a second felony offender, the agreed-upon sentence of six years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.
Defendant first contends that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because County Court failed to advise him of the trial-related rights he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 361 [2013]). Defendant did not advance this issue in an appropriate postallocution motion, despite having had sufficient opportunity to do so, and it is accordingly unpreserved for our review (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 381-382 [2015]; People v Forest, 141 AD3d 967, 968 [2016]). The record, in any event, “shows that defendant was fully advised of his trial-related rights during the allocution” (People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]; see People v Walker, 135 AD3d 1244, 1245-1246 [2016]).
Defendant’s further challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver is unavailing. County Court explained the right to appeal to defendant and distinguished it from the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, all of which defendant confirmed that he understood. He then reviewed a detailed written waiver with counsel and signed it in open court. Defendant’s appeal waiver was therefore a knowing, intelligent and voluntary one (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d at 1538).
Defendant’s remaining claims are not properly before us. The assertion that defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel, to the extent that it survives his guilty plea and appeal waiver, is unpreserved given the lack of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Lobaton, 140 AD3d 1534, 1535 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 972 [2016]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2008]). By pleading guilty, defendant waived his contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the special prosecutor (see People v Abdullah, 122 AD3d 958, 959 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]; People v Gryner, 116 AD3d 1247, 1248 [2014]). Lastly, defendant’s protestation that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Constantopoules, 141 AD3d 942, 943 [2016]).

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 5, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a multicount indictment stemming from an incident in which he was discovered operating a motor vehicle containing a quantity of heroin, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was thereafter sentenced in accord with his plea agreement to a prison term of seven years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we find defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal invalid, as County Court “did not adequately convey that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty but, rather, improperly lumped those rights together” (People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Blackmon, 122 AD3d 1071, 1072 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]). Further, although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, the court’s colloquy was not adequate to ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]).
Turning to the merits, we reject defendant’s contention that the traffic stop of his vehicle was without legal justification. It is fundamental that “probable cause exists for a traffic stop if an officer observes a defendant committing a traffic violation” (People v Portelli, 116 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2014]). The arresting officer testified at the suppression hearing that defendant’s vehicle passed by his location and he observed that the vehicle did not have an illuminated license plate (see Vehicle and Traf fie Law § 375 [2] [a] [4]). The officer then followed the vehicle to confirm his initial observation and, upon catching up to it, further observed that the vehicle had excessively tinted windows (see Vehicle and Traffic Law § 375 [12-a] [b] [2]). The officer then initiated the traffic stop. County Court credited this testimony, and “we accord great weight to the suppression court’s factual findings that are supported by the record” (People v Morris, 105 AD3d 1075, 1077 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1042 [2013]). Here, as the uncontroverted testimony of the arresting officer confirmed that the stop was initiated only after the officer had observed two violations, we find no error in County Court’s determination that the stop of defendant’s vehicle was justified (see People v Thompson, 106 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2013]; People v Hawkins, 45 AD3d 989, 990-991 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1034 [2008]; People v Brooks, 23 AD3d 847, 849 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 810 [2006]).
Finally, we disagree with defendant’s assertion that the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive. Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of seven years with two years of postrelease supervision despite his plea agreement allowing for a prison term of eight years. Moreover, defendant possesses a lengthy criminal history that spans five decades and includes multiple periods of incarceration. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed (see People v Edwards, 96 AD3d 1089, 1092 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1102 [2012]; People v Kelly, 71 AD3d 1292, 1292-1293 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered August 15, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends that his admission at a presentence interview that he abuses alcohol is a first step toward rehabilitation and should be viewed as a mitigating factor warranting reduction of his sentence. Not only does defendant admit that he voluntarily pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, but two other charges were dropped as a result of the plea arrangement. In addition, the concurrent 5-to-10-year prison sentence defendant received is less than the maximum sentence for the crimes for which he pleaded guilty (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3], [4]). Under the circumstances, his admission that he has an alcohol problem does not demonstrate either extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion by County Court warranting the reduction of his sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; see also, People v Lohnes, 158 AD2d 813).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered January 8, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that this sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of a two-count indictment knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. In addition, this sentence is within the statutory limits and not the harshest that could have been imposed. Under the circumstances, we find no basis to disturb the sentence.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered October 11, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of various charges against him, defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and purportedly waived his right to appeal. The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would enter into the Judicial Diversion Program and that, if he failed to complete the program, he would face a term of imprisonment to be followed by postrelease supervision. Defendant was ultimately charged with violating the terms of the program and was terminated from it after waiving his right to a hearing and admitting that he had used cocaine and lied to program officials about that usage (see CPL 216.05 [9]). County Court agreed to, and did, sentence defendant to a prison term of six years to be followed by postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we agree with defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal is invalid, as “he was not advised that it was a right separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty” (People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]). Defendant’s further challenge to the voluntariness of his plea was not preserved for our review by a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, and he said nothing during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation require ment (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014]). Likewise, defendant has not preserved his argument that County Court abused its discretion in terminating him from the Judicial Diversion Program, as he admitted to violating the terms of the program in return for a specified sentence and made no effort to attack that agreement before County Court (see People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2014]).
Turning to issues relating to defendant’s sentence, we are unpersuaded that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive given defendant’s extensive criminal history (see People v Cooney, 120 AD3d 1445, 1446 [2014]; People v Johnson, 12 AD3d 727, 727-728 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 745 [2004]). It is lastly evident from the record that, while County Court referred to defendant as a second felony offender at sentencing, defendant falls within a subset of that category and was actually sentenced as a second felony drug offender (see People v Whalen, 101 AD3d 1167, 1170 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013] ; compare Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b], with Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i]). Accordingly, an amended uniform sentence and commitment form must be prepared that reflects his status as a second felony drug offender (see People v Patterson, 119 AD3d 1157, 1159 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1046 [2014]; People v Vasavada, 93 AD3d 893, 894 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 978 [2012]; compare People v Whalen, 101 AD3d at 1170).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Lynch, J.), rendered April 29, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of charged and uncharged accusations that he was involved in the drug trade, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant further waived his right to appeal from the conviction and sentence. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the promised prison term of four years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.
As an initial matter, defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant during the plea colloquy that, while he would ordinarily retain the right to appeal to a higher court after pleading guilty, he would be expected to give up that right so long as the sentence imposed was the one contemplated by the plea agreement. Defendant stated that he understood and agreed to waive his right to appeal. He then conferred with defense counsel and executed a detailed written waiver in open court that he acknowledged he understood. Therefore, “in view of the whole colloquy, particularly given this defendant’s background, including his extensive experience with the criminal justice system and multiple prior guilty pleas that resulted in terms of” incarceration, we find that his appeal waiver was valid (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 342 [2015]; see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1332-1333 [2016]).
Defendant next contends that the voluntariness of his guilty plea was impaired by the deficient performance of defense counsel but, while that challenge survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 214 [2016]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d at 1333). In any case, to the extent that his claim is not belied by the record, it involves “matters that are outside the record on appeal, such as what counsel advised him or investigated, [that are] more properly raised in a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL article 440” (People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016]; see People v Hughes, 134 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 966 [2016]).
Finally, defendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes him from arguing that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255; People v Renert, 143 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2016]).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Breslin, J.), rendered February 11, 2015 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, and the plea agreement also included the waiver of the right to appeal. Supreme Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to 5V2 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The record discloses that Supreme Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea and defendant affirmed his understanding of the waiver. Defendant also signed a written waiver after conferring with counsel regarding its contents. Accordingly, defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal his conviction and sentence was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Miller, 137 AD3d 1485, 1485 [2016]; People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1239-1240 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]). Defendant’s valid appeal waiver precludes his claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Woods, 141 AD3d 954, 955 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1076 [2016]; People v Mann, 140 AD3d 1532, 1533 [2016]).
Defendant also claims that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered because Supreme Court did not inform him of the sentencing range he would be exposed to if he rejected the plea offer and went to trial. We cannot say that defendant, who has a lengthy criminal record, was unaware that he could be exposed to a prison sentence if he rejected the plea offer and was found guilty following a trial on this indictment. In our view, defendant had ample opportunity to either raise this issue in an objection during these proceedings or in a motion to withdraw his plea and, therefore, he was required to preserve this claim (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 221-222 [2016]; People v Crowder, 24 NY3d 1134, 1136-1137 [2015]; People v White, 142 AD3d 1254, 1255 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1128 [2016]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Eidens, J.), rendered April 7, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was subsequently sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon term of 4x/2 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals, claiming that County Court erred in failing to conduct further inquiry when the plea colloquy cast doubt upon the voluntariness of his plea.
First, defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders this issue unpreserved (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635-636 [2001]). In any event, defendant claims that his negative response to County Court’s question, “Do you agree there is nobody forcing you to [plead guilty]?,” should have triggered further inquiry from the court because it reflects the fact that his plea may have been the product of coercion. However, when defendant’s statement is read in the context of the entire allocution, a more persuasive reading of his response is that he was, in fact, stating that he was not under any duress to plead guilty. The response thus falls well short of calling into question the voluntariness of defendant’s plea (see People v Lopez, supra; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]). We conclude that County Court conducted an appropriate colloquy and properly accepted defendant’s plea (see People v Seeber, 4 AD3d 620, 621-622 [2004]) and, therefore, we affirm.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered October 12, 1990, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
We initially find that, because defendant made no incriminating statements, was fully advised of all of her rights and no plea was taken, she was not prejudiced by the absence of counsel at her initial arraignment (see, People v Tyson, 15 NY2d 866, affg 22 AD2d 764; People v Terrance, 120 AD2d 805, 806; People ex rel. De Berry v McMann, 24 AD2d 661). In any event, following her indictment defendant was rearraigned in County Court with assigned counsel present. Nor do we find any reason to disturb defendant’s prison sentence of five years to life. First, defendant derived a benefit from pleading guilty as she was able to plead to an A-II felony instead of an A-I felony (compare, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i], with Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). In addition, several charges were dropped as a result of her plea and she was sentenced within the range promised when she entered her guilty plea. Under these circumstances, coupled with the fact that defendant did not receive the harshest sentence possible, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Sise, J.), rendered February 18, 2000 in Montgomery County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was the subject of an indictment, dated June 8, 1998, charging him with the crimes of criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree arising out of his alleged possession and sale of crack cocaine in the City of Amsterdam, Montgomery County, on September 6, 1996. While these charges were pending, defendant was arrested and indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on a charge of conspiracy to violate the narcotics laws of the United States (see, 21 USC § 841 [a] [1]; § 846) based upon his alleged drug-related activities from 1992 to November 19, 1996 “in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere.”
On December 8, 1998, pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. He expressly waived his right to appeal and agreed to be sentenced to a State prison term of 3¥2 to 7 years. It was further agreed that, if defendant were sentenced on the Federal offenses prior to sentencing on the State charge, the State sentence would run concurrently. The following colloquy occurred:
“The Court: And it’s also my understanding, * * * that this federal charge hasn’t been disposed of.
“[Defense counsel]: That’s correct. That charge is still pending.
“The Court: Thus Criminal Procedure Law Section 40.20 does not apply.
“[Defense counsel]: Yes.”
In January 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to the Federal conspiracy charge for which, in September 1999, he was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 168 months.
. In December 1999, defendant moved to vacate his plea to the State charges and to dismiss the indictment by asserting a violation of CPL 40.20, and NY Constitution, article I, § 6. Supreme Court denied the motion, concluding that while the conduct upon which the State indictment was grounded was encompassed within the time frame of the Federal conspiracy charge, there existed no double jeopardy. It reasoned that defendant’s guilty plea constituted a conviction and that the sentence levied constituted a judgment upon the conviction. Having entered a plea to the State charge before pleading to the Federal charge, it found that no claim of double jeopardy could be asserted under State law. Sentenced on February 18, 2000 as a second felony offender to the previously agreed upon prison term of 3V2 to 7 years, defendant now appeals, asserting claims of double jeopardy and ineffective assistance of counsel.
We affirm. Since defendant entered his plea of guilty to the State charge with full knowledge of the provisions of CPL 40.20, his plea constituted a forfeiture of any claim predicated upon a violation of that statute (see, People v Prescott, 66 NY2d 216, 219, cert denied 475 US 1150). Similarly waived was defendant’s constitutional double jeopardy claim based upon the content of his plea allocution which demonstrated “a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, intended comprehensively to cover all aspects of the case” (People v Muniz, 91 NY2d 570, 575). With no constitutional, statutory or public policy mandate prohibiting its acceptance (see, id.), we can find no error despite the fact that the underlying claim had not fully matured.
Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not implicate the voluntariness of his plea and, as such, is similarly foreclosed by the articulated guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Coleman, 281 AD2d 653; People v Johnson, 267 AD2d 609). We note that had we reached the merits of either of these claims, we would have found no error (cf., Matter of Seda v Sise, 231 AD2d 36; see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chenango County (Dowd, J.), rendered August 7,1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a seven-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Prior to sentencing, defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to the agreed upon prison term of 5 to 15 years. Defendant appeals.
Previously, we granted defense counsel’s request to be relieved of his assignment (23 AD3d 755 [2005]). New counsel was assigned to raise any issues which the record may disclose (id.). Defendant has since been deported and is unavailable to obey the mandate of the court.

Were we not dismissing his appeal, we would have found defendant’s arguments to be without merit. A review of the record confirms that his plea was knowing and voluntary and nothing in the plea colloquy casts doubt upon his guilt or the effectiveness of his counsel (see People v Coss, 19 AD3d 943, 943-944 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 805 [2005]; People v Hodges, 13 AD3d 979, 980 [2004]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered January 21, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant entered a plea bargain agreement pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a 10-count indictment. In exchange, he was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, contending that his guilty plea should be vacated because he entered it under the apprehension that he would be eligible for participation in a shock incarceration program (see, Correction Law art 26-A). Although the record is silent in this regard, defendant was apparently denied admission to a shock incarceration program following his conviction.
In any event, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention. A review of the plea hearing transcript discloses that while defendant’s eligibility for participation in a shock incarceration program was briefly discussed by defense counsel and County Court, his admission was never made a condition of the plea agreement (see, People v Christian, 158 AD2d 705, 706), nor could the agreement have been conditioned thereon as admission to the program is not determined until an inmate has submitted an application that has been screened by a ""shock incarceration selection committee” (Correction Law § 866 [2]) and, if approved by the committee, has been passed on to the Commissioner of Correctional Services for a final determination (see, Correction Law § 867 [2]). Hence, defendant’s admission to a shock incarceration program could not have been made a condition of the plea bargain agreement as neither the prosecution nor County Court had the power to guarantee his participation therein. Defendant has failed to show that his plea was other than, knowing, voluntary and counseled; hence, the judgment of conviction will not be disturbed.

"Peters, J.P.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with numerous drug-related offenses. He pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon the understanding that he would receive an aggregate prison sentence of seven years to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. While he was offered a shorter prison term of five years if he waived his right to appeal, he initially rejected that offer. He then moved to withdraw his guilty plea. County Court denied defendant’s motion, but allowed him to execute an appeal waiver and imposed an aggregate prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision.
Defendant now appeals and argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered. Although such a challenge “survives his appeal waiver and is preserved due to his motion to withdraw the plea” (People v Johnson, 77 AD3d 986, 986 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 743 [2011]; see People v Ortiz, 69 AD3d 966, 967 [2010]), we nevertheless find it to be unpersuasive. Defendant contends that he was under a great deal of stress at the time he pleaded guilty and did not understand the terms of the plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, however, he was advised at length as to the terms of the agreement and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. Defendant expressed no concerns in response, instead assuring County Court that he understood his rights and was proceeding freely, had consulted and was satisfied with defense counsel, and admitted his guilt. The record thus demonstrates that defendant’s guilty plea was in all respects knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Shovah, 67 AD3d 1257, 1258 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 773 [2010]; People v Quinones, 51 AD3d 1226, 1227 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 938 [2008]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ferdinand, J), rendered May 12, 2004, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
While on probation for two drug-related felonies, the defendant was arrested and indicted for selling heroin to an undercover officer within 1,000 feet of a school. He subsequently entered a plea of guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. The court promised that if he successfully completed a DTAP program (Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison Program), the plea would be vacated and the indictment would be dismissed. The court warned, however, that if he failed to complete the program, he would face a sentence of 4V2 to 9 years’ imprisonment as a second felony offender. The defendant was fully allocuted and, upon his admission, was adjudicated a second felony offender. He was subsequently discharged from one residential drug treatment program for noncompliance, and left a second residential program without permission and against clinical advice. He was thereafter arrested for another drug sale. The court sentenced him to a term of 4V2 to 9 years’ imprisonment.
The defendant’s purported waiver of his right to appeal from the sentence imposed was ineffective (see People v Brown, 13 AD3d 548 [2004]; People v Williams, 258 AD2d 544 [1999]; People v Rose, 236 AD2d 637 [1997]; People v Rolon, 220 AD2d 543 [1995]). Contrary to the defendant’s contention, however, the sentence was neither unconstitutional nor excessive (see People v Moore, 261 AD2d 421 [1999]; People v James, 251 AD2d 208 [1998]; People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered June 16, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a superior court information. County Court agreed to impose a sentence of 4 to 12 years in prison provided that defendant not get into any further trouble with the law before the sentencing date. While on bail awaiting sentencing, defendant was arrested and charged with two drug-related felonies. Consequently, a modified plea agreement was negotiated whereby the two new drug-related felonies were dismissed and defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. We reject defendant’s contention on appeal that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. A review of the record evidences no abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed in the interest of justice, especially given the favorable nature of the plea agreement and his conduct while awaiting sentencing (see, People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880; People v Galarza, 237 AD2d 817, lv denied 90 NY2d 905).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered May 6, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant seeks a reversal of his conviction on the ground that County Court erred in denying his request to discharge the Public Defender and for the assignment of new counsel. It is axiomatic that a defendant must demonstrate good cause for substitution of assigned counsel (see, People v Sawyer, 57 NY2d 12, cert denied 459 US 1178). The record in the case at bar fully supports County Court’s denial of defendant’s request.
As a result of defendant’s request for substitution of counsel, County Court undertook a painstaking inquiry concerning the reasons for such request. Defendant claimed that he had ""lost confidence” in the Public Defender by reason of his failure to advise defendant of a plea offer in the Town Court in which defendant was arraigned. There is a disagreement between defendant and the Public Defender as to whether the plea offer was tendered to defendant in ""open court”. The record is clear, however, as admitted by defendant, that the Public Defender advised defendant of the plea offer three days before the appearance in Town Court while defendant was in the County Jail and that defendant rejected such offer. The record further reveals, as admitted by defendant, that the offer was again related to defendant in private while at Town Court. Defendant’s claimed loss of confidence in the Public Defender because the offer was not made in open court before the Judge and Assistant District Attorney, a fact disputed by the Public Defender, is specious and County Court properly refused to assign new counsel.

"Kavanagh, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered February 9, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was charged in a five-count indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminally using drug paraphernalia and thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction thereof. Following County Court’s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant was sentenced to four years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Preliminarily, we reject defendant’s assertion that County Court erred in summarily denying his motion to withdraw his plea based upon alleged coercion and ineffective assistance of counsel. “Generally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement” (People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 802 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; see People v Carr, 288 AD2d 561 [2001]). To that end, the decision to permit withdrawal of a defendant’s guilty plea is a matter committed to the trial court’s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to the plea’s voluntariness (see People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002]; see People v Vinals, 2 AD3d 1210 [2003]). Here, the record is devoid of any indication of fraud or innocence, and defendant’s conclusory allegation of coercion is belied by the transcript of his plea allocution, wherein defendant plainly denied that he had been threatened or otherwise forced to plead guilty (see People v Nichols, 21 AD3d 1273, 1274 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 757 [2005]).
Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is equally unpersuasive. “In the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995] [citations omitted]; see People v Vinals, 2 AD3d at 1211). As County Court observed in denying defendant’s motion, the plea negotiations occurred over a lengthy period of time during which various motions were made on defendant’s behalf. Additionally, County Court questioned defendant at length regarding his opportunities to confer with counsel, and defendant unequivocally indicated that he had sufficient time to consult with counsel and was satisfied with counsel’s representation. Finally, it is apparent from the record that counsel negotiated an advantageous plea to a reduced charge on defendant’s behalf (see People v Adams, 31 AD3d 1063, 1066 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 845 [2006]). Under such circumstances, we perceive no abuse of discretion in County Court’s summary denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (see id. at 1065-1066).
Defendant’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary also is lacking in merit. Even a cursory review of the plea allocution reveals that defendant understood the nature of the charge against him, was apprised of the rights he would be forfeiting by pleading guilty and voluntarily entered into such plea. Notably, “[defendant was not required to recite the elements of the crime or engage in a factual exposition, as it was sufficient that he provided unequivocal affirmative responses to the court’s questions, never made statements negating his guilt and indicated that he was entering the plea because he was, in fact, guilty” (People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 972 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]). Finally, we reject defendant’s assertion that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered April 3, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of reckless endangerment in the first degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree, criminal mischief in the second degree, criminal impersonation in the second degree and criminal mischief in the fourth degree.
Defendant contends that his conviction of a crime in Florida was improperly invoked as the ground upon which he was sentenced as a second felony offender. We disagree. In order for an out-of-State conviction to qualify an individual as a second felony offender, the offense must carry a sentence of over one year in prison and must be comprised of elements which would constitute a felony in this State, punishable by a sentence of over one year (see, People v Sailor, 65 NY2d 224, 237; People v Gonzalez, 61 NY2d 586, 589). Defendant’s conviction in Florida of the crime of solicitation to deliver cocaine (Fla Stat § 893.13 [1] [a]), satisfies these criteria. It is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and its elements are analogous to those of Penal Law § 220.06 (1), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class D felony, punishable by a minimum prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. We conclude that under the circumstances presented here, defendant was properly sentenced as a second felony offender. His remaining contentions have been examined and found to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered August 24, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant’s only contentions on this appeal are that the sentence of 2 to 6 years’ imprisonment imposed upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree is harsh and excessive and that County Court abused its discretion in denying his request to waive the mandatory surcharge. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to the instant offense in satisfaction of a two-count indictment and pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, which was less than the harshest possible. Given these facts, as well as defendant’s criminal record, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Revels, 191 AD2d 905; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, Iv denied 71 NY2d 899). We also find no abuse of discretion in County Court’s denial of a waiver of the surcharge (see, People v Fulton, 138 AD2d 514, Iv denied 71 NY2d 1027; People v Taylor, 112 AD2d 597).

The pertinent facts surrounding this matter can be found in a decision by this court wherein we dismissed the petition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced by defendant to prohibit the County Judge from refusing to accept his original guilty plea to a class B felony (see, Matter of Guzman v Harrigan, 158 AD2d 872). Defendant now argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to argue in that proceeding that the District Attorney should have been compelled to adhere to his original plea agreement which, defendant contends, included dismissal of three out of four indictments. As is evidenced by the record in this appeal and this court’s decision dismissing the petition in the article 78 proceeding (supra), dismissal of the indictments was never offered to defendant by the District Attorney; rather, the first plea was to be in satisfaction of all four indictments. Therefore, even had defendant’s trial counsel made the argument now advanced on this appeal, it would have been unavailing. In addition, as we also pointed out in Matter of Guzman v Harrigan (supra), County Court had no choice but to reject the first plea as it was in violation of CPL 220.30 (3) (b) (i) (see, supra, at 873; see also, People v Bartley, 47 NY2d 965, 966). We have also considered defendant’s remaining argument with respect to the excessiveness of his concurrent prison sentences, the harshest of which is 15 years to life, and reject it as lacking in merit (see, People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169, 174; People v Honsinger, 162 AD2d 877, 878, lv denied 76 NY2d 894).

"—Carpinello, J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Berke, J.), rendered April 17, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child. Represented by the Public Defender, defendant originally chose to go to trial. On March 3, 1998, however, the date of the scheduled Huntley and Mapp hearings, defendant informed County Court that she wished to enter an Alford plea of guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. County Court conducted a lengthy colloquy to determine whether defendant’s plea was knowing and voluntary, informing her of the strong evidence of her guilt of the charged crimes and noting that if she were to proceed to trial and be found guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, she could be sentenced to a prison term of SVs to 25 years. The court then accepted defendant’s guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing hearing. On the date thereof, defendant informed County Court that she had decided to withdraw her guilty plea and proceed to trial, arguing that the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 6 years was excessive due to her status as a drug addict at the time the charged crimes were committed. County Court denied the request and proceeded to impose the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant has served the minimum two-year term of her sentence and has been released. She appeals from the judgment of conviction.
We affirm. Defendant, facing a strong case against her and a potential sentence of 8V3 to 25 years in prison, entered an Alford plea. The record shows said plea to have been knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made with a full understanding of its consequences thus rendering the plea valid (see, People v Ruger, 279 AD2d 795, 796, lv denied 96 NY2d 806). Therefore, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s request to withdraw her plea.
In addition, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s assertions that the Public Defender failed to provide her with effective assistance of counsel, as evidenced by an alleged failure to participate in Huntley, Mapp and Sandoval hearings. Defense counsel had filed an omnibus pretrial motion which was duly granted by County Court. The Huntley and Mapp hearings were scheduled to take place on the date when defendant elected to enter her Alford plea while the Sandoval hearing was scheduled to take place immediately prior to the start of her trial. As these hearings were canceled after they had been rendered moot by defendant’s plea, she cannot now complain that her right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because they were not held.
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been examined and found to be either unpreserved for our review or without merit.

"Mercure, J. P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered April 9, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of grand larceny 'in the fourth degree.
On the eve of trial, defendant disposed of a two-count indictment with a counseled plea of guilty to grand larceny in the fourth degree. The plea was entered with the understanding, stated on the record, that defendant would be sentenced as a second felony offender to the shortest permissible sentence, a prison term of IV2 to 3 years, with a recommendation of shock incarceration. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, primarily contending that his guilty plea was not properly entered and that CPL 410.91 is unconstitutional because it deprives him of equal protection of the law. We perceive no merit to defendant’s contentions and accordingly affirm.
First, defendant having failed to move to withdraw or to vacate his guilty plea, his contentions addressed to the voluntariness of his plea have not been preserved for our consideration (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 976, lv denied 88 NY2d 994; People v Perez, 228 AD2d 821, lv denied 88 NY2d 968; People v Trathen, 227 AD2d 73, lv denied 88 NY2d 996). In any event, the transcript of the plea allocution establishes that defendant’s plea of guilty was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Contrary to defendant’s current assertion, there is no requirement that a defendant personally recite the facts underlying his or her crime (see, People v Trathen, supra).
Second, to the extent that the issue survived defendant’s plea of guilty and his qualified waiver of appeal, we are not persuaded that CPL 410.91, which creates the sentencing option of parole supervision for eligible individuals with a history of controlled substance dependence {see, CPL 410.91 [3]), denies defendant (who claims to have a problem with alcohol and nonnarcotic drugs) equal protection of the law. In view of the current nationwide drug crisis and the criminal conduct engendered thereby, it cannot be seriously argued that legislation targeting drug-dependent individuals and providing for intensive drug treatment in lieu of incarceration does not bear a reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective (see, People v Barnes, 62 NY2d 702).
In view of our determination that CPL 410.91 is not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, the remaining contention, addressed to his trial counsel’s failure to adequately pursue that issue, need not be considered.

H In light of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Oliver v United States (466 US_, 52 USLW 4425), which reaffirmed the open fields doctrine (see Hester v United States, 265 US 57), we reject defendant’s claim that the search of his property and the seizure of the marihuana plants discovered there violated the Fourth Amendment. This being so, the material seized following the execution of the subsequent search warrant cannot be suppressed as the product of previous illegal searches and seizures. 11 We are of the view, however, that the fine imposed is not legally permissible. A fine greater than $5,000 can be imposed for a felony, such as attempted criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree (see Penal Law, § 110.05, subd 5; § 221.30), only when the defendant derives a “gain” from the commission of the crime (Penal Law, § 80.00, subds 1, 2) and only after County Court makes a finding as to the amount of the “gain” (Penal Law, § 80.00, subd 3). It is conceded that County Court did not make such a finding and it is clear that any gain was nullified by the seizure of the marihuana by the police (Penal Law, § 80.00, subd 2). Accordingly, a $5,000 fine was the maximum which could have been legally imposed and County Court was powerless to impose a greater fine, notwithstanding the plea agreement (see People v Grant, 92 AD2d 985). Although this error was not raised below, this court cannot permit a sentence which is invalid as a matter of law to stand (see CPL 470.15, subd 2, par [c]; People v Grant, supra). Because the fine must be reduced, the District Attorney must be afforded an opportunity to withdraw from the plea agreement (see People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 307-308; People v Ciccone, 91 AD2d 688, 689-690; see, also, Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 220.10, p 206). Consequently, the matter must be remitted for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered April 4, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In January 2003, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of a 19-count indictment arising out of his involvement in a drug-selling operation. He was sentenced to a prison term of IOV2 years to life. Defendant appeals, challenging the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal made in connection with the plea, as well as the severity of his sentence. The record reveals, however, that defendant signed a comprehensive written acknowledgment of his right to appeal and waiver of that right, and that defendant informed County Court during the plea colloquy that his attorney had explained the meaning of the written waiver to him and he understood it. In light of his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, defendant’s arguments regarding the severity of his sentence are precluded (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered June 21, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal, with the understanding that he would be sentenced to five years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. To the extent that defendant challenges the valid ity of his appeal waiver, the plea colloquy and the written waiver executed in open court demonstrate that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]; People v Merrill, 123 AD3d 1339, 1339 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 970 [2015]). Defendant’s remaining contention, that his plea was involuntary, survives his appeal waiver but is not preserved for our review, as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 123 AD3d 1375, 1376 [2014], lv denied 26 NY3d 935 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). Further, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not implicated here, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Kormos, 126 AD3d 1039, 1040 [2015]; People v Skidds, 123 AD3d 1342, 1342-1343 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Lomanto, J.), rendered December 20, 1999, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on five counts of varying degrees of criminal possession of a controlled substance, one of which was a class A-I felony. Pursuant to a plea bargain, and after some initial protestations of innocence which prompted further inquiry, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the entire indictment. He was thereafter sentenced to the agreed-upon concurrent prison terms, which included a term of six years to life on the class A-I felony. Upon subsequently learning that the sentence on the class A-I felony was illegal because a minimum sentence of lh years to life was required (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]), County Court vacated defendant’s conviction of that crime only and, in its place, attempted to allocate a plea to a reduced class A-II felony drug possession crime. Although defendant stated that he wanted to plead guilty to the reduced crime, he denied possessing any drugs and repudiated his prior admissions upon which the original plea was based. Nevertheless, based upon those earlier admissions, County Court accepted defendant’s plea to the reduced crime and imposed a prison sentence of six years to life to run concurrently with the remaining terms previously imposed. Defendant appeals only from the judgment which resentenced him.
“Where the plea bargain includes a sentence which is illegal because the minimum imposed is less than that required by law, this Court has held that the proper remedy is to vacate the sentence and afford the defendant, having been denied the benefit of the bargain, the opportunity to withdraw the plea” (People v Martin, 278 AD2d 743, 744 [citation omitted]). Inasmuch as the entire sentence is “part and parcel of the plea bargain,” it must be vacated in its entirety regardless of whether portions of the sentence are legal (People v Sellers, 222 AD2d 941). The question posed by this appeal is whether vacatur of the entire sentence and offering defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea is the only proper remedy. We conclude that it is not.
The principles underlying the rule stated in People v Martin (supra) can be found in People v McConnell (49 NY2d 340), where the Court of Appeals explained that “in most instances when a guilty plea has been induced by an unfulfilled promise either the plea must be vacated or the promise honored, but * * * the choice rests in the discretion of the sentencing court” (id., at 346). Accordingly, where the sentence imposed pursuant to a plea bargain is illegal because it is greater than that permitted by law, the sentencing court can reduce the sentence without affording the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea, provided that the reduced sentence gives the defendant the full benefit of the plea bargain (compare, People v Henderson, 145 AD2d 676, lv denied 73 NY2d 978, with People v Martin, supra). In this case, County Court reduced the top count of the indictment, with the apparent consent of the People, so that the sentence upon which the plea bargain was based could legally be imposed. In these circumstances, the full benefit of the plea bargain remained intact and, therefore, we see no abuse of discretion in County Court’s remedy, which effectively honored that bargain.
We reject defendant’s claim that his “protestations of innocence at resentencing requires a different conclusion. When defendant initially appeared for his plea, he made numerous statements which negated one or more essential elements of the crimes charged in the indictment and County Court, with the assistance of defense counsel and the Assistant District Attorney, conducted a thorough inquiry in accordance with the requirements of People v Lopez (71 NY2d 662). As a result of this inquiry, defendant voluntarily admitted the elements of the crimes. His subsequent protestations of innocence at resentencing raised the same issues that had been fully explored during the earlier allocution and, despite the protestations of innocence, defendant not only failed to seek to withdraw his earlier plea, he also stated that he wanted to plead guilty to the reduced charge in place of the class A-I felony so that he could receive the bargained-for sentence. In these circumstances, there is no basis to disturb the judgment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered April 1, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a 12-count indictment, and further waived his right to appeal orally and in a written document executed in open court. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to eight years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel, which he is permitted to raise by the terms of his valid appeal waiver. The record does not reflect that defendant moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, however, and his claim is accordingly not preserved for our review (see People v Williams, 101 AD3d 1174, 1174 [2012]; People v Haskins, 86 AD3d 794, 796 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 903 [2011]). Within that context, defendant also asserts that a local criminal court that handled a related felony complaint lacked jurisdiction over him but, to the extent that issue survived his guilty plea and appeal waiver, any defects were rendered academic by an indictment having subsequently been handed up against him, which “superceded all prior proceedings” (People ex rel.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered June 8, 1987, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In February 1987 defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, along with a misdemeanor possession charge. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class D felony, in exchange for a promised sentence of 3 to 6 years in prison. The agreement presupposed that defendant qualified as a predicate felon. During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged giving heroin to one Reynolds. On May 8, 1987, the scheduled sentencing date, defendant moved to vacate his guilty plea, indicating that he was now aware of certain defenses. The matter was adjourned pending County Court’s review of the plea minutes. On May 18, 1987 the court, after review of the plea minutes, rejected the withdrawal motion but acceded to defense counsel’s request to submit a memorandum of law. On May 26, 1987 defendant submitted a written motion to vacate, contending that the agreed-upon sentence was unauthorized since the People failed to establish the existence of a prior felony conviction. On June 8, 1987, while again denying the vacatur motion, County Court recognized that the agreed sentence could not be imposed because defendant’s status as a predicate felon had not been confirmed. Upon a conviction of a class D felony, the minimum component of an indeterminate sentence may not exceed one third of the maximum term imposed (Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [b]X Consequently, the court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 2 to 6 years in prison.
On this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate the plea inasmuch as the bargained-for sentence was unauthorized. At first glance, the argument seems implausible for defendant actually received a lesser sentence than bargained for. However, ""[i]t is fundamental that the breach of a promise made to induce a guilty plea entitles a defendant to either withdraw his plea or be resentenced” (People v Felman, 137 AD2d 341, 343; see, People v Jones, 99 AD2d 1). The question here is whether any promises were in fact breached. It is evident that the plea agreement was premised on defendant’s potential status as a predicate felon. At sentencing, the People acknowledged that they were not able to demonstrate the existence of a prior felony conviction (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15; cf., People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142) and thus the bargained-for sentence, which set the minimum at one half the maximum, was unauthorized (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [bJX
We do not, however, agree that a lesser sentence served to breach the plea agreement. The inability to impose a predicate sentence did not undermine the very basis of the plea agreement since the benefits remained intact (cf., People v Traynor, 101 AD2d 898). Defendant was charged with a class B felony with a maximum exposure of 8 Vs to 25 years in prison (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and sought to minimize his prison exposure. This objective was clearly achieved. Moreover, it is difficult to perceive how defendant was misled into believing he qualified as a predicate felon. In our view, the sentence was appropriately reduced to reflect defendant’s correct status, and was in accord with the plea agreement.
Nor did defendant otherwise establish a viable basis for vacating the plea. The plea minutes show that defendant, a college graduate, voluntarily entered the plea and specifically discussed any potential defenses, including agency and entrapment, with counsel (see, People v Pratt, 99 AD2d 909).
We further conclude that defendant was accorded a reason able opportunity to advance his challenge to the plea at the various appearance dates. There is no precise formula for entertaining a motion to withdraw, provided the applicant is accorded a reasonable opportunity to advance his claim (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 524-525; People v Stubbs, 110 AD2d 725, 727). While County Court might better have conducted a more specific interrogation of defendant, the basis for his motion was presented, i.e., that the sentence was illegal and that certain defenses had been discovered (cf., People v White, 137 AD2d 859). As indicated, however, the plea minutes confirm that defendant discussed potential defenses with counsel, and further belie any claim of duress. In the final analysis, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea (see, CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Benoit, 142 AD2d 794; People v Howard, 138 AD2d 525).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered May 10, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with seven counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, which allegedly occurred at various locations in and around the Village of Ellenville, Ulster County, in 1999. Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment in full satisfaction thereof and, in accordance with a plea agreement, was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we reject defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea. Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he has not preserved this issue for our review (see People v Barnes, 302 AD2d 623, 623 [2003]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]). Were we to consider defendant’s challenge, we would find it without merit. While the record reflects, as defendant claims, that he was unable to recall the specific sale to which he allocuted, he admitted making numerous cocaine sales, including one sale in Ulster County on the date alleged in the count of the indictment to which he pleaded guilty.
We likewise reject defendant’s assertion that County Court erred in failing to assign new counsel and that his trial counsel failed to provide him with meaningful representation. Defendant did not demonstrate good cause for the requested substitution of assigned counsel (see People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]) and, in light of the extremely advantageous plea bargain, we cannot say that defendant received less than meaningful representation (see People v Allen, 301 AD2d 874, 875 [2003]).

Defendant, waiving his right to appeal, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years.
We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the waiver of the right to appeal is ineffective due to the catch-all provision purporting to waive all appealable matters defendant may have as of right. Although nonwaivable issues are excluded from the scope of the waiver, the remainder of the waiver is valid and enforceable (see People v Wagoner, 6 AD3d 985 [2004]; People v Umber, 2 AD3d 1051, 1052 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]).

Were we to consider the merits of the argument, we would find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed despite defendant’s youth and sparse criminal history (see People v Baker, 6 AD3d 751 [2004]; People v Baker, 195 AD2d 700 [1993]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered December 9, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On March 1, 2003, defendant provided a quantity of crack cocaine to Dorothy Davis in the City of Binghamton, Broome County. Defendant was thereafter indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to the charged crime and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 4V2 to 9 years in prison.
Initially, defendant contends that County Court erred in accepting his plea of guilty because his recitation of the facts raised a possible agency defense. However, this argument is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Collier [Kelliehan], 283 AD2d 671, 671 [2001], lvs denied 96 NY2d 917, 920 [2001]; People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1006 [1999]). Although defendant maintains that the exception to the preservation rule applies herein because this is “the rare instance where ‘the . . . recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon the defendant’s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea’ ” (People v Saitch, supra at 725, quoting People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]), we do not agree. Significantly, the exception applies only where the court “fails to probe further to ensure that the defendant’s plea is voluntary and the defendant understands the nature of the plea” (People v Mejias, 293 AD2d 819, 820 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]; see People v Lopez, supra at 666).
Here, prior to accepting his plea, County Court carefully explained to defendant his constitutional rights and advised him of the rights he would be surrendering by pleading guilty. Defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and proceeded to clearly articulate that he gave Davis a quantity of crack cocaine in exchange for money that Davis had given to him on a prior occasion. In our view, County Court’s inquiry sufficiently established the benefit that defendant received from participating in the sale “and elicited sufficient facts supporting the conclusion that defendant acted with an ‘independent desire or inclination to promote the transaction’ ” (People v Mejias, supra at 820, quoting People v Argibay, 45 NY2d 45, 54 [1978]).
Defendant further argues that the allocution did not establish that he was a “seller” of controlled substances as contemplated by the Penal Law. Notably, Penal Law § 220.00 (1) states that “ ‘[s]ell’ means to sell, exchange, give or dispose of to another, or to offer or agree to do the same.” Contrary to defendant’s argument, the record establishes that he did sell drugs in accordance with that definition. Although no money actually changed hands at the time the drugs were provided to Davis, defendant admitted that he gave them to her in exchange for money that she had previously given to him. Therefore, defendant was properly deemed to have sold drugs under the meaning of the Penal Law.
We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions, including his claim that the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738) should be applied retroactively so as to reduce his sentence (see People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 597 n [2005]), and find them to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered June 15, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment and executed a waiver of his right to appeal. Under the terms of his plea agreement, County Court agreed to sentence defendant to a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision provided that he did not have any undisclosed prior felonies. Upon finding thereafter that defendant had a prior felony conviction that had not been considered, the court adjourned sentencing for further review and to allow defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Defendant chose not to withdraw his plea and agreed to proceed to sentencing and to be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of six years with two years of post-release supervision; the court then imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we find that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude his challenge to the sentence, as his written waiver executed in the course of the plea proceedings expressly recited only the original four-year sentence. Turning to the merits, in light of defendant’s criminal history and the severity of the conduct underlying his conviction, we reject his sole contention on appeal that the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive (see People v Tetreault, 131 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]; People v Ensley, 53 AD3d 929, 930 [2008]).

"Lynch, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered June 10, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, defendant entered a guilty plea to the reduced charge of criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree. The agreement included a promise to cooperate in the prosecution of his codefendant, an appeal waiver and a waiver of his right to apply for conditional release. County Court imposed a sentence of 365 days in jail. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Contrary to defendant’s claim, he was advised, during the plea colloquy and in the written appeal waiver signed in court, that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea agreement. Further, the plea colloquy and the written waiver together establish defendant’s understanding of his appeal rights, which he had discussed with counsel, that the appeal waiver was separate and distinct from the other rights he automatically forfeited by his guilty plea, and that his waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Yaw, 120 AD3d 1447, 1448 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1005 [2014]). Further, defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his appeal waiver and was not preserved for our review by a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, and he did not say anything that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Rouse, 119 AD3d 1161, 1162-1163 [2014]; People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]).
Defendant claims that conditioning the plea agreement on his waiver of the right to apply for conditional release under Penal Law § 70.40 (2) was improper. This point was not raised in County Court and, thus, it is not preserved for our review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). His argument that it constitutes a “mode of proceedings error” which can be raised for the first time on appeal is not supported by the statute or case law (see People v Hanley, 20 NY3d 601, 604-605 and n 2 [2013]; compare People v Wright, 119 AD3d 972, 973-974 [2014]). We do not find that conditioning a guilty plea on the waiver of the statutory right to apply for conditional release on parole falls within this “tightly circumscribed class” of fundamental errors for which preservation is not required and to which a defendant cannot consent as part of a plea agreement (People v Kelly, 5 NY3d 116, 120 [2005]; see People v Hanley, 20 NY3d at 604; People v Becoats, 17 NY3d 643, 651 [2011], cert denied 566 US —, 132 S Ct 1970 [2012]; People v Patterson, 39 NY2d 288, 295 [1976], affd 432 US 197 [1977]). This condition does not intrude upon the authority of the Board of Parole to decide a conditional release request, but speaks only to defendant’s right to apply for such relief in this first instance. Finally, given that defendant’s valid appeal waiver “encompass [es] any issue that does not involve a right of constitutional dimension going to the very heart of the process” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), this claim is precluded by his appeal waiver.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered December 19, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Faced with a five-count indictment and potential lengthy consecutive sentences, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal in exchange for a prison sentence of either 5V2 or 6 years. County Court sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to six years in prison followed by a period of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals arguing that his sentence is excessive.
We affirm. Assuming, without deciding, that defendant’s appeal waiver was invalid so as to permit consideration of the sentence issue (see People v Rolley, 100 AD3d 1263, 1263-1264 [2012]; People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 791 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 833 [2000]; cf. People v Vellon, 128 AD3d 1274, 1275 [2015] ), we nevertheless find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances meriting a reduction of defendant’s sentence in light of his criminal record and the imposition of a sentence within the agreed range (see People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]).

"McCarthy, J.
In 1999, defendant, a resident alien who had legally entered the United States, pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court (Leaman, J.) imposed six terms of 1 to 4 years in prison, three to run consecutively and three to run concurrently. Upon defendant’s appeal challenging only the harshness of his sentence, this Court affirmed (People v Reynoso, 11 AD3d 719 [2004]). In 2010, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his conviction. County Court (Nichols, J.) denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals by permission.
Defendant contends that his plea was not knowing and voluntary, and that counsel was ineffective, because counsel did not discuss any defenses — namely agency and entrapment — with defendant, informed defendant that he had no defenses, misinformed him concerning the deportation consequences of his plea, and pressured him to plead guilty. Initially, defendant’s al legations were properly raised in a CPL 440.10 motion because they rely on information outside the record of the plea proceedings and therefore could not have been raised on direct appeal (see People v Hickey, 277 AD2d 511, 511-512 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 964 [2000]; see also People v Lafoe, 75 AD3d 663, 664 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 953 [2010]; compare CPL 440.10 [2] [c]). County Court properly discounted the allegations that defendant was pressured to plead guilty, as those allegations were conclusory and not factually supported.
County Court properly denied a hearing on the aspects of defendant’s motion concerning defenses. A court may deny a CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing if “[a]n allegation of fact essential to support the motion ... is contradicted by a court record ... or is made solely by the defendant . . . [and] there is no reasonable possibility that such allegation is true” (CPL 440.30 [4] [d]). At the beginning of the plea proceedings, defense counsel advised the court that he had specifically told defendant “about any defenses in this case,” “[i]n particular an agency defense,” and that he would be waiving those defenses. During the plea colloquy, the court informed defendant that by pleading guilty he would be “giving up any and all defenses . . . including but not limited to the so called agency defense and the so called entrapment defense.” Defendant acknowledged the court’s warnings, did not ask any questions about the identified defenses, and stated that he was satisfied with counsel’s representation. His current assertions that he was unaware of the agency and entrapment defenses are belied by the record, permitting the court to deny a hearing regarding those allegations.
Defendant was entitled to a hearing, however, on the aspect of his motion alleging that counsel was deficient by providing incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences of the plea (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US —, —, 130 S Ct 1473, 1483 [2010]). As relevant here, federal law provides that any alien who is convicted of violating a state law “relating to a controlled substance ... is deportable” (8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). An alien convicted of illicit trafficking of controlled substances has committed an aggravated felony (see 8 USC § 1101 [a] [43] [B]), and is not eligible to have the United States Attorney General cancel his or her deportation (see 8 USC § 1229b [a] [3]). Thus, defendant’s deportation was virtually mandated by his conviction for selling a controlled substance. According to defendant, however, his counsel advised him that he could avoid deportation if he pleaded guilty and appealed the sentence. Defendant’s “understanding was that if [he] appealed the sentence, by the time [he] was released from prison, [he] could no longer be deported.” He also averred that had he known that a plea of guilty would definitely lead to deportation, he would not have pleaded guilty, but would have taken his chances at trial. Defendant sufficiently alleged that counsel provided incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences that would result from his plea, and that defendant was prejudiced because he would not have pleaded guilty had he been properly advised. Hence, defendant was entitled to a hearing on that aspect of his motion alleging that his judgment of conviction should be vacated because it was thereby tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel (see People v Williams, 72 AD3d 1347, 1348 [2010]; People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered June 17, 1994, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and was sentenced to a prison term of seven years to life. Defendant contends that this sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Our review of the record reveals that at the time of defendant’s arrest, she was serving a five-year term of probation arising out of her prior conviction of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In addition, a police search of defendant’s apartment prior to her arrest disclosed over 12 ounces of cocaine, 125 small glass vials, $3,100 in cash and an unlicensed handgun. Given these factors, defendant’s criminal record and the fact that the sentence was an agreed-upon term of defendant’s plea bargain, we conclude that the sentence should not be disturbed (see, People v Reid, 224 AD2d 728, 729).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered September 21, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted assault in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, petitioner pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and attempted assault in the second degree in exchange for sentencing as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 4 years. On this appeal, defendant contends that the sentences imposed by County Court are harsh or excessive. Defendant, a second felony offender, received concurrent sentences that were well within the statutory guidelines and were the product of plea bargaining negotiations. Absent any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the interest of justice, the record before us provides no ground upon which to base a modification of defendant’s sentence (see People v Conyers, 285 AD2d 825, 827, lv denied 97 NY2d 680; People v Archangel, 272 AD2d 686, 687).
The People concede, however, that the mandatory surcharge of $200 and the crime victim assistance fee of $10, imposed upon defendant for each of his convictions, constituted a violation of the US Constitution’s ex post facto clause because defendant’s convictions arose out of offenses committed in January 2000, prior to the effective date of the amendment to Penal Law § 60.35 (1) (a). Accordingly, this matter is remitted to County Court for reconsideration of the mandatory surcharge and fee.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Lambert, J), rendered October 18, 2010, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to two five-year terms of imprisonment, to run consecutively to one another and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving on another conviction, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Defendant argues that his sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record that includes a number of drug-related convictions. Notably, the convictions at issue stem from defendant’s involvement in two incidents in which he sold cocaine to a confidential informant. Under the circumstances presented, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]; People v Burroughs, 64 AD3d 894, 898-899 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 794 [2009]).
Likewise, we find no merit to defendant’s two assertions raised in his supplemental pro se brief in support of his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Phillips, 96 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]).

As a part of his plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. He now contends that the waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and that the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of 12 to 24 years was harsh and excessive. Insofar as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, he has failed to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea for review. In any event, the record reveals that the waiver was in fact knowingly and voluntarily entered. In addition, given that defendant was permitted to enter his plea in full satisfaction of a 16-count indictment, was sentenced in accordance with the plea arrangement and was sentenced within the statutory parameters, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J), rendered January 4, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In May 2011, defendant was charged in a superior court information with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Defendant waived indictment and, represented by assigned counsel, thereafter entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he would receive six months of interim proba tion and, if successfully completed, a sentence of five years of probation. During the plea colloquy, County Court affirmed that defendant was in good physical and mental health and that he had not been threatened or forced into entering the plea agreement. When asked whether he was satisfied with counsel’s performance, defendant unequivocally stated that he had discussed the case at length with counsel and that he believed that counsel had done a “good job.” The court thereafter accepted defendant’s guilty plea and sentenced him to six months of interim probation, which included psychiatric treatment and participation with an assisted outpatient treatment order.
When defendant appeared for sentencing in November 2011, after successfully completing his interim probation, defendant resisted his continued participation with the assisted outpatient treatment order and, for the first time, expressed dissatisfaction with counsel and requested a new attorney. County Court pointed out that counsel had performed well in negotiating probation rather than prison time for defendant, but informed defendant that he had the right to hire different counsel or represent himself, although he did not have a choice of assigned counsel. At counsel’s request, suggesting that defendant “may not be himself today,” the matter was adjourned.
WTien the matter came on for sentencing in January 2012, defendant still expressed dissatisfaction with his representation, alleging for the first time that counsel had pressured him into taking the plea agreement while defendant was on medication. County Court reminded defendant that, at the time of the plea, he had stated that he had not been pressured into pleading guilty and the court had taken defendant at his word. Accordingly, the court imposed the agreed-upon five years of probation. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. We find no merit to defendant’s contention that County Court failed to make adequate inquiry before denying his request for substitute counsel. “An indigent criminal defendant must demonstrate ‘good cause’ for the appointment of substitute counsel, such as a conflict of interest or other irreconcilable conflict” (People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d 1483, 1486 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 954 [2010], quoting People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]; see People v Linares, 2 NY3d 507, 510 [2004]). The trial court, in determining whether good cause exists, must consider the timing of the request, the effect on the progress of the case and whether present counsel is capable of providing meaningful assistance (see People v Linares, 2 NY3d at 510; People v Rolfe, 83 AD3d 1219, 1220 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 809 [2011]; People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d at 1486). Here, County Court made ample inquiry into defendant’s dissatisfaction with counsel and — having specifically queried defendant about the claimed deficiencies during the plea colloquy — found them to be unpersuasive. The court further noted that, considering defendant’s extensive criminal history, counsel had performed admirably in convincing both the court and the District Attorney that defendant would be better served by probation. We find no abuse of County Court’s discretion in denying defendant’s request for substitute counsel (see People v Phillips, 96 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]; People v Malcolm, 74 AD3d at 1487; People v Breedlove, 61 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 913 [2009]).
Lastly, we reject defendant’s challenge to the condition of his probation that requires him to take antipsychotic medication. Defendant agreed to voluntarily comply with all treatment recommendations as a requirement of his right to remain at liberty and this requirement is not punitive, but, rather, is reasonably related to his rehabilitation (see People v Hale, 93 NY2d 454, 462 [1999]; People v Franco, 69 AD3d 981, 983 [2010]; People v Brogan, 292 AD2d 781, 782 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 673 [2002]).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered August 13, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Upon pleading guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of seven years to life. We reject defendant’s contention that he was entrapped into committing the crime to which he pleaded guilty, the most serious count of the indictment, to enable the People to gain leverage in plea negotiations. By pleading guilty, defendant waived all factual defenses, including the defense of entrapment (see, People v Normandin, 122 AD2d 348). Further, we find no denial of defendant’s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws in the District Attorney’s policy not to accept pleas to less than the top count of an indictment. The offer of a plea bargain is not a constitutional right, but a matter of prosecutorial discretion (see, Weatherford v Bursey, 429 US 545, 561). Because neither a fundamental right nor a suspect classification is involved here, we need find only a rational basis for different plea-bargaining policies in different counties (see, People v Elliby, 80 AD2d 875). Such a basis is apparent in the differing caseloads and staffing which exist in different areas of the State. Finally, given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a single count in full satisfaction of a nine-count indictment and the sentence was in accord with the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered July 31, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant’s guilty plea was taken in satisfaction of a three- count indictment, with an agreement by the People to forego any charges of bail jumping. As part of the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal except as to the sentence he would receive. County Court sentenced defendant to six months in jail and five years’ probation.
On appeal, defendant first contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because certain pretrial motions were not made on his behalf. Although defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from raising this argument (see, People v Hartford, 217 AD2d 798; People v Rosado, 199 AD2d 833, lv denied 83 NY2d 876), defendant has failed to show that his attorney had no legitimate reason to forego the pretrial motions, so as to rebut the presumption that counsel acted competently (see, People v Hartford, supra). Our review of the record reveals that meaningful representation was provided at all stages of the proceeding (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 146-147).
Nor do we find defendant’s sentence harsh or excessive. Defendant received an advantageous plea agreement, and a sentence that was in accord with that agreement and well within the statutory guidelines.

Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a three-count indictment. Although the negotiated plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to a 21/2-year prison term with two years of postrelease supervision, County Court advised defendant that if he was arrested prior to sentencing, he would be subject to an enhanced sentence. Defendant was thereafter arrested on two separate occasions prior to the date of his sentencing and, as a result, County Court sentenced him to 4V2 years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, asserting that County Court erred in failing to inquire about the arrests prior to sentencing him. We agree.
“ ‘When an issue is raised concerning the validity of [a] postplea charge or there is a denial of any involvement in the underlying crime, the court must conduct an inquiry at which the defendant has an opportunity to show that the arrest is without foundation’ ” (People v Curtis, 278 AD2d 664, 665 [2000], quoting People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993], cert denied sub nom. Maietta v Artuz, 519 US 964 [1996]; see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]; People v Naranjo, 89 NY2d 1047, 1049 [1997]). While the nature and extent of the inquiry is discretionary, it “must be of sufficient depth ... so that the court can be satisfied—not of defendant’s guilt of the new criminal charge but of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest on that charge” (People v Outley, supra at 713). Here, when given the opportunity to comment on the arrests, defendant offered exculpatory explanations, claiming that one arrest was malicious and that he was not present at the time and location of the alleged offense underlying the second arrest. Despite these contentions by defendant, which served as a challenge to the validity of the arrests, County Court sentenced him to an enhanced prison term without further inquiry. Accordingly, inasmuch as County Court failed to ascertain whether there was a legitimate basis for the postplea arrests, we must remit this matter for a new sentencing hearing in accordance with this decision (see People v McClemore, 276 AD2d 32, 35-37 [2000]; cf. People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1050-1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]).
The People’s remaining argument has been reviewed and found to be lacking in merit.

Appeals (1) by permission, from an order of the County Court of Sullivan County (Williams, J.), entered December 13, 1989, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of two counts of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing, and (2) from two orders of said court, entered January 8, 1990 and February 1, 1990, which denied defendant’s motions for reargument.
On August 13, 1987, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of third degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine), class B felonies, pursuant to a negotiated plea and was sentenced to two concurrent prison sentences of 4 to 12 years (see, People v Auslander, 146 AD2d 936). Thereafter in a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10, defendant sought to vacate this judgment of conviction upon the basis that the People failed to fulfill the terms of the plea bargain. Defendant argued before County Court, and contends on this appeal, that the District Attorney agreed to recommend to the court a more favorable sentence in return for meaningful cooperation on his part.
The threshold issue requires a determination of the plea bargain. At defense counsel’s request and with the consent of the prosecution, defendant and the court, counsel was permit ted to place the plea agreement on the record, stating ""that it [was] necessary to dictate a complete understanding of the terms and conditions before we proceed to effectuate it”. Thereafter, defendant’s attorney invited immediate interruption if anything he stated was not in conformance with the agreement. With that background, counsel dictated the following relevant portion of the agreement: ""Now, [the District Attorney] has made no commitment or assemblance [sic] of a commitment; but between the time of the plea and the time of the sentence, he would be receptive to meaningful cooperation and upon which, in his sole discretion, he may make other recommendations at some other time.”
Defendant argues that his August 24, 1987 letter sent to the District Attorney entitled him to a lesser sentence. We disagree. While defendant is entitled to specific performance of a plea bargain agreement (People v Auslander, supra), it is clear that the agreement in this case does not provide for a required lesser sentence. Because the crux of defendant’s motion is the existence of an unfulfilled promise, the motion must fail because it is clear that no agreement was reached. Accordingly, the motion was properly denied without a hearing (see, CPL 440.30 [4]; People v Crimmins, 38 NY2d 407, 418), and it was not necessary to determine whether the subject letter, sent prior to the time defendant absconded while on bail prior to sentencing, constituted meaningful cooperation. The orders denying defendant’s motions for reargument are not appeal-able.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered September 10, 2015, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to five years of probation. He was subsequently charged with violating certain conditions of his probation and admitted to the probation violations, again waiving his right to appeal. Thereafter, County Court revoked his probation and resentenced him as a second felony drug offender to 10 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant contends, among other things, that the resentence is invalid because a predicate felony statement was not filed in accordance with CPL 400.21 (2) before he was sentenced as a second felony drug offender. Although this claim has not been preserved for our review due to defendant’s failure to make an appropriate motion (see People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]), under the particular circumstances presented, we exercise our discretion in the interest of justice to take corrective action (see People v Loper, 118 AD3d 1394, 1395 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1204 [2015]; People v Kimmons, 39 AD3d 1180, 1181 [2007]). The People concede and the record reveals that a predicate felony statement was never filed as is required by CPL 400.21 (2). In addition, there is no indication that defendant had notice that he would be sentenced as a second felony drug offender when he admitted to the probation violations or at resentencing. Consequently, defendant did not have an opportunity to contest his prior convictions. In view of this, the resentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing (see People v Fields, 79 AD3d 1448, 1449 [2010]; People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]; People v Mosley, 54 AD3d 1098, 1099 [2008]; People v Anthony, 52 AD3d 864, 865 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 733 [2008]; People v Ruddy, 51 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 787 [2009]).

"Mugglin, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered April 10, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After lengthy and thorough explanation by both counsel and County Court, a negotiated plea agreement was reached and defendant pleaded guilty as a second felony offender to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and, as a persistent violent felony offender, to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 4 years, 5x/2 years and 5x/2 years to life, respectively, all sentences accompanied by applicable periods of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, claiming that his pleas of guilty were involuntary, he received the ineffective assistance of counsel and the sentences were harsh and excessive.
We disagree and affirm. Defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for our review (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; People v Vanguilder, 32 AD3d 1110, 1110 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 904 [2006]). In any event, this claim is without merit. His claim that he was confused and under duress at the time he entered his guilty pleas finds no record support as his rights and the consequences of his pleas were repeatedly and thoroughly explained to him. Although some degree of tension between defendant and his attorney is evident, there is no indication that the pleas were in any way coerced. Notably, defendant made neither a protestation of innocence nor any claim of ignorance with respect to his constitutional rights.
Next, defendant’s present claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Wise, 29 AD3d 1216, 1216 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 852 [2006]). In any event, again the record reveals no merit to this claim. Counsel made an omnibus motion, sought suppression of all identification evidence at a hearing and, in view of defendant’s prior criminal history, successfully negotiated an extremely advantageous plea bargain agreement (see People v Anderson, 38 AD3d 1061, 1063 [2007]; People v Downs, 38 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2007]). Accordingly, were we to reach this issue, we would conclude that defendant was afforded the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).
Finally, any challenge to the sentence imposed is precluded by defendant’s waiver of appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]). Moreover, as the record fails to reveal any extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction, defendant’s sentences were neither harsh nor excessive (see People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 917 [2000]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered July 20, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree in full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment and waived his right to appeal. The plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to three years in prison, to be followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea on the ground that his plea was not entered into voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently. County Court denied the motion and thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. “Whether to allow withdrawal of a guilty plea is left to the sound discretion of County Court, and will generally not be permitted absent some evidence of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement” (People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 922 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; accord People v Wilson, 92 AD3d 981, 981 [2012]). Here, defendant’s contention that he did not understand what he was pleading guilty to or that he was to be sentenced to three years in prison under the plea agreement is belied by the record. A review of the plea colloquy reveals that defendant had previously discussed the plea and its consequences with counsel, was fully apprised by County Court of the terms of the plea agreement and heard and understood the terms prior to entering his plea. Accordingly, we conclude that County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion was a sound exercise of its discretion (see People v Keating, 96 AD3d 1107, 1108 [2012]; People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]).
We also reject defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The plea allocution and the written waiver of appeal executed in open court demonstrate that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011]; People v Jean-Francois, 82 AD3d 1366, 1366 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 797 [2011]). Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea and his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, which survive his appeal waiver and were preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d 811, 812 [2008]), are nevertheless without merit. The plea minutes reflect that defendant admitted his guilt and affirmatively responded to County Court’s inquiries regarding the elements of the crime. Consequently, we conclude that the allocution was sufficient (see People v Ackley, 84 AD3d 1639, 1640 [2011]; People v Kaszubinski, 55 AD3d 1133, 1135-1136 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 855 [2009]). To the extent that defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, such claim involves matters outside of the record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Leszczynski, 96 AD3d 1162, 1163 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 998 [2012]). In any event, the record demonstrates that counsel negotiated a favorable plea and defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he had been provided enough time to discuss the plea with counsel and that he was satisfied with his services (see People v Wilson, 92 AD3d at 981-982 [2012]; People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d at 1347).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered June 23, 1989, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Contrary to defendant’s claim, we do not find the sentence imposed to be harsh and excessive. She was permitted to plead guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. Further, upon her plea she was informed that she could receive a prison sentence with a maximum term of 15 years (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]). Instead she received a prison term of only 1 to 3 years. Under the circumstances and given defendant’s previous criminal record, as well as the presentence report indicating that she was not an appropriate candidate for probation (see, People v Gholston, 137 AD2d 765, lv denied 71 NY2d 896; People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305), we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Keegan, J.), rendered March 5,1993, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In a prior decision (206 AD2d 604), we remitted this matter to County Court for a hearing and determination with respect to the issues raised in defendant’s suppression motion. As a result of such hearing, County Court held that the police conduct in obtaining the warrant was reasonable and that defendant was within the area and class of individuals authorized to be searched pursuant to the terms thereof. It accordingly denied the motion to suppress.
We agree with such determination. The conduct of the police officers executing the warrant was reasonable in light of the criminal activity afoot (see, People v Easterbrook, 35 NY2d 913, cert denied 421 US 965) and the language of the warrant (see generally, People v Betts, 90 AD2d 641; cf., People v Green, 33 NY2d 496).
Similarly unavailing is defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive and that the presentence report was prejudicial. We find the presentence report to accurately reflect that defendant had extensive experience in the criminal justice system and was paroled less than two years before the instant offense. As to the sentence, clearly falling within the statutory parameters, we find no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a modification in the interest of justice.
We have reviewed all other substantive issues raised and find them to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County, rendered March 27, 1972, convicting defendant, on his plea of guilty, of criminal possession of a dangerous drug, fifth degree. Appellant was indicted on a two-count indictment charging him with criminally selling a dangerous drug, fourth degree (Penal Law, § 220.30) and criminal possession of a dangerous drug, fifth degree (Penal Law, § 220.10). He was duly arraigned and counsel assigned. On June 4,1970 the court, in the presence of the defendant and counsel, directed an investigation to determine appellant’s eligibility for treatment as a youthful offender, and on June 19, 1970 the court determined appellant was eligible for such treatment following the necessary consent by appellant and his counsel. A plea of not guilty was then entered and the matter adjourned for trial. On the return date appellant failed to appear, nor did he appear on a subsequent trial date. On February 4, 1971 the court on its own motion revoked and rescinded appellant’s eligibility for youthful offender treatment, directed that the indictment be unsealed and appellant be treated as an adult. An order was entered to this effect and, on March 18, 1971, a further order was entered revoking bail and issuing a bench warrant. Approximately a year later appellant returned to the jurisdiction and pled guilty to the second count of the indictment in full satisfaction thereof. On March 27, 1972 he was sentenced to a reformatory term and committed to the Elmira Reception Center. On this appeal appellant contends (1) that the court lacks the power to revoke youthful offender eligibility once it is granted, (2) it abused its discretion when it failed to grant youthful offender treatment and (3) the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. The court originally determined that appellant was “ eligible ” for youthful offender treatment under the provisions of section 913-g of the former 'Code of Criminal Procedure. Such a determination, of course, is discretionary with the court (People v. Wheeler, 36 A D 2d 662; Matter of Tschornyi v. County Ct. of County of Tompkins, 283 App. Div. 910, mot. for lv. to app. den. 307 N. Y. 942), and in the exercise thereof remains the inherent right to revoke that determination, either under prior or existing law (Code Crim. Pro., § 913-g; GPL 720.20). As to the sentence imposed, we find no reason to interfere with the studied judgment of the sentencing court (People v. Wheeler, supra; People v. Caputo, 13 A D 2d 861). Judgment affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered August 19, 2008, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of promoting prison contraband in the first degree.
On March 7, 2008, while defendant was serving a weekend sentence in the Broome County Jail for a prior criminal offense, jail officials searched her cell and discovered heroin and dalmane, a prescription drug. As a result, defendant was charged in a superior court information with two counts of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. She subsequently waived indictment and pleaded guilty to one count in full satisfaction of both charges and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. She now appeals.
Although defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of her plea allocution is precluded by her failure to make a motion to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d 853, 854 [2009]), the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable as defendant’s factual recitation negated an essential element of the crime to which she pleaded guilty (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 672 [2007]). Although a person confined to a detention facility is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree merely by possessing dangerous contraband (see Penal Law § 205.25 [2]), defendant was not charged with violating that specific subdivision of the applicable statute. Rather, defendant’s crimes are alleged to have been committed in violation of Penal Law § 205.25 (1), which states that a person is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree if the person “knowingly or unlawfully introduces dangerous contraband into a detention facility.” Indeed, count one of the superior court information charges defendant with “bringing] heroin into the Broome County [Jail]” and count two charges her with “bringing dalmane] into the Broome County [Jail].”
Before accepting defendant’s plea to count one, County Court asked her if she brought heroin into the jail and defendant answered “yes.” However, on further inquiry by the court, defendant stated that she found the heroin on the floor of a dressing room within the facility. Although defendant added that “[she] was in possession of it so [she was] guilty,” County Court informed her that “maybe not. . . [y]ou are charged with bringing it in.” Notwithstanding such an implicit acknowledgment of defendant’s possible confusion regarding the distinction between subdivisions (1) and (2) of Penal Law § 205.25, County Court did not clarify to defendant that she had only been charged with the former. Rather, County Court’s subsequent inquiries pertained strictly to whether defendant brought dalmané into the facility and where “in the jail” she found the heroin. Inasmuch as defendant’s responses offered no indication that she was admitting to bringing the heroin into the jail, or that she was even aware of the exact nature of the charge to which she was pleading guilty, we conclude that County Court improperly accepted her guilty plea to count one of the superior court information (see People v Pagan, 36 AD3d 1163, 1165 [2007]).
Defendant’s remaining contention is rendered academic by our decision.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered October 27, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of assault in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of three indictments containing four counts, defendant pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 21h to 5 years on the assault charge and 41/2 to 9 years on the drug charge. It was also agreed that the weapons charge would be dismissed if defendant appeared on the scheduled sentencing date. Defendant, however, failed to appear at sentencing. County Court then imposed separate prison terms of 21h to 5 years on the assault and weapons charges, to be served consecutively, and 10 to 20 years on the drug charge, to be served concurrently with the other two sentences.
On appeal, defendant contends that his guilty plea was not properly entered. However, because defendant never moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, he cannot now challenge the sufficiency of his plea (see, People v Villafane, 216 AD2d 605, l;v denied 88 NY2d 996). In any event, the transcript of the plea allocution reveals that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea following a sufficient inquiry by County Court, during which time defendant admitted his guilt to the requisite elements of the crimes charged (see, People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 975, lv denied 88 NY2d 994).
We also reject defendant’s contention that the terms of imprisonment were harsh and excessive. Defendant has an extensive criminal record. In addition, he was specifically warned at the plea proceeding that if he failed to appear at sentencing, County Court would no longer be under any obligation to honor the agreed-upon prison sentences. In fact, the court told defendant that he faced the possibility of the harshest prison terms available and that each could be imposed consecutively.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Coccoma, J.), rendered May 19, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment by a grand jury and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, with a recommendation that he be allowed to participate in a shock incarceration program. He now appeals and we affirm.
Initially, defendant contends and the People concede that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Upon our review of the record, we share that view (see People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 973 [2006]). For that reason, we have considered defendant’s further assertion that his sentence was harsh and excessive, yet find it to be unpersuasive. Contrary to defendant’s claim, the agreed-upon sentence was statutorily permissible and, given his criminal background and the nature of his crime, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion or that any extraordinary circumstances are present which would warrant a reduction of the sentence (see People v Wallach, 35 AD3d 913, 914 [2006]; People v Milner, 28 AD3d 873, 874 [2006]).

On March 10, 1995, an undercover police investigator purchased an aluminum packet of cocaine from an individual he identified as defendant. Defendant was later arrested and charged in a two-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to the first count in the indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment and he agreed to waive his right to appeal. Prior to his sentencing, defendant made a written motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. County Court denied this motion and eventually sentenced defendant to 5 to 10 years in prison as a second felony offender. This appeal followed.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is his claim that County Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing. We disagree. ""Our review of the plea allocution indicates that the guilty plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made without any protestations of innocence and that defendant understood that he was waiving any defenses he might have had to the charges against him” (People v Tillinghast, 208 AD2d 1030, lv denied 84 NY2d 1016). Under these circumstances, defendant’s post-plea assertion of innocence based on an alibi defense and the issue of identification does not vitiate his plea (see, supra; see also, People v Baker, 225 AD2d 949). Accordingly, we will not disturb County Court’s exercise of its discretion.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered March 24, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in two indictments with various drug-related crimes arising from his sale of heroin to undercover police and the execution of a search warrant at his home. Defendant moved pursuant to CPL 216.05 for judicial diversion based upon his alleged drug addiction, and the motion was denied by County Court. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all charges. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Initially, defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to follow the procedure prescribed by CPL 216.05 and request a substance abuse evaluation in connection with the motion for judicial diversion. This claim, however, has not been preserved for our review as defendant did not raise it before County Court, and the record does not reveal that he made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea on this ground (see People v Driscoll, 147 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]).
Defendant further argues that his counsel was ineffective in abandoning his request for a Mapp hearing and recommending that he enter a guilty plea when defendant was not in the proper state of mind. Although clearly impacting the voluntariness of his guilty plea, this claim is also unpreserved given that the record does not disclose that defendant made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Cooks, 150 AD3d 1323, 1324 [2017]; People v Hankerson, 147 AD3d 1153, 1153 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 998 [2017]; People v Cox, 146 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2017]). Nevertheless, we find that the narrow exception to the preservation rule was triggered by defendant’s initial statement during the plea colloquy that he did not know that the substance was heroin, thereby negating an element of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law § 220.39 [1]) and imposing a duty upon County Court to conduct a further inquiry (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d 1407, 1407 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). The record indicates that County Court further questioned defendant concerning his knowledge of the substance and briefly recessed the proceeding to allow him to confer with counsel after which defendant admitted that he knew that the substance was, in fact, heroin. Defendant has not contested County Court’s remedial action, and there is no indication that he was mentally impaired at the time that he entered his guilty plea (see People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 998 [2016]). Accordingly, we find that defendant’s guilty plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Pixley, 150 AD3d 1555, 1556 [2017]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d at 1407). Furthermore, we find that he received an advantageous plea and that nothing in the record casts doubt upon his counsel’s effectiveness (see People v McCray, 139 AD3d 1235, 1237 [2016]; People v Seuffert, 104 AD3d 1021, 1022 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1009 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered January 17, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as a result of an incident wherein he sold a plastic bag containing cocaine to an undercover police officer for $50. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years as a second felony offender. Arguing that County Court erred by accepting his guilty plea, defendant appeals.
During the plea allocution, defendant stated that he had been acting as a “go-between” during the transaction and was acting on behalf of the buyer. Unsatisfied with that allocution, County Court explained that if defendant was claiming that he was acting on behalf of the buyer, he should proceed to trial with an agency defense. Defendant, however, adamantly expressed that he did not want to go to trial and he specifically waived any possible agency defense. Unconvinced that defendant understood what he was pleading to, the court permitted defendant to confer with his counsel. After a brief conference with his attorney, defendant explained that he had in fact acted on behalf of the seller of the cocaine. Defendant stated that he knew he was selling cocaine and that it was illegal to do so.
Essentially, defendant now argues that he did not enter into his plea knowingly because he did not understand that he had a possible agency defense to pursue or what such a defense meant. Failing to challenge his plea by a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has failed to preserve this issue (see, CPL 220.60; see also, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Smith, 248 AD2d 891; People v Jones, 240 AD2d 950, 951, lv denied 91 NY2d 875; People v Fredericks [Fredricks], 235 AD2d 254, lvs denied 89 NY2d 1011). In any event, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement (see, People v Berthiaume, 240 AD2d 953; People v Battiste, 238 AD2d 724, lv denied 90 NY2d 901). The record clearly shows that County Court took substantial efforts to ensure that defendant understood what he was pleading to and that he would be waiving the right to raise certain defenses at trial by pleading guilty (see, People v Costanza, 244 AD2d 988).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered January 3, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant, a legal permanent resident, was indicted in September 2005 for the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. After extensive plea negotiations, including consideration of his possible deportation for committing a felony narcotics offense (see 8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]) and a negative evaluation for admission to the Drug Court, defendant pleaded guilty on January 11, 2006 to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to four months in jail followed by five years of probation.
After receipt of the presentence report, County Court, with the consent of the District Attorney, agreed to place defendant on interim probation for a period of one year, after which-assuming he complied with the terms of probation-defendant’s guilty plea to the felony would be vacated and he would be permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, thereby avoiding the possibility of deportation. However, other charges were filed against defendant within the probationary term and, subsequently, defendant changed attorneys and moved to withdraw his plea. Finally, on January 3, 2008, after 22 scheduled court appearances, County Court sentenced defendant to five years of probation. Defendant now appeals, asserting that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted.
We disagree and affirm. “Generally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement” (People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940 [1998] [citation omitted]) and “the decision to permit withdrawal ... is a matter committed to the trial court’s sound discretion” (People v Singletary, 51 AD3d 1334, 1334 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 741 [2008]). Here, a careful review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion in County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (see generally People v McDonald, 296 AD2d 13, 17 [2002], affd 1 NY3d 109 [2003]).

Following a Wade hearing, defendant entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison sentence of 3 to 9 years. Defendant’s contention that ineffective assistance of counsel compelled him to plead guilty is without merit. Defense counsel’s performance, when viewed in its totality, fully satisfied the criteria of effective legal representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147), defendant’s current disagreement with defense counsel’s professional advice and strategies notwithstanding. Our review of the record herein discloses that defendant’s guilty plea represented a voluntary, knowing and intelligent choice (see, People v Legault, 180 AD2d 912, 913, lv denied 79 NY2d 1051), as evidenced by the fact that it resulted in the satisfaction of a three-count indictment and a sentence that was far less than the one to which he would have been exposed had his case gone to trial.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered September 16, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree.
Defendant entered his plea of guilty with the understanding that his sentence would be a fine of $10,000, payable at the time of sentencing. County Court specifically advised defendant that if he intentionally failed to appear at sentencing on the scheduled date, he could be sentenced in absentia to a term of imprisonment of lVá to 4 years. Defendant was asked if he agreed to such an arrangement as a condition of the plea bargain and he answered in the affirmative. Defendant appeared for sentencing on August 17, 1988 and requested an adjournment until September 12, 1988. The court granted the request, but again stated that defendant’s failure to appear on the scheduled date could result in a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant failed to appear for sentencing on September 12, 1988 and his attorney requested a two-day adjournment, explaining that defendant had recently been involved in an automobile accident and was having minor difficulty obtaining sufficient cash for the fine. On September 14, 1988, defendant’s counsel appeared without defendant and again asked for a two-day adjournment, with a similar explanation. When defendant failed to appear on September 16, 1988, the court denied his attorney’s request for another adjournment and sentenced defendant in absentia to a prison term of lVs to 4 years. Defendant’s bail was revoked and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued.
Defendant was arrested and brought before the court on March 13, 1989. When questioned as to the reason for his failure to appear for sentencing as scheduled, defendant explained that he had been unable to obtain sufficient cash to pay the fine and was fearful that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. County Court refused to reconsider the previously imposed sentence.
Defendant claims on appeal that County Court erred in sentencing him in absentia, but there is ample evidence in the record that defendant’s failure to appear was deliberate and, therefore, he waived his right to be present (see, People v Sanchez, 65 NY2d 436). Defendant was fully advised of the consequences of his failure to appear and he agreed to sentencing in absentia if his failure to appear was intentional. He was given several opportunities to appear or provide an adequate excuse for his absence. He did neither. The court made a sufficient inquiry into the surrounding circumstances to determine that defendant’s failure to appear was deliberate, and the court was justified in refusing to grant another adjournment.
Defendant has filed a pro se letter proclaiming his innocence, but such a claim was forfeited by his guilty plea. The judgment should be affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Coccoma, J.), entered July 12, 2010 in Schenectady County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
As the result of an investigation into organized drug activity in Schenectady County, defendant was charged in an indictment with the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to an aggregate prison term of 14 years, plus five years of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.

Further, with regard to the plea, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated a material element of the crime or otherwise raised any doubt as to his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Sherman, J.), rendered January 7, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of three counts of the crime of forgery in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted on 12 counts of forgery in the second degree and 12 counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree. Claiming that he forged the checks in order to support his cocaine habit, defendant sought to plead guilty and be sentenced to parole supervision for drug treatment pursuant to CPL 410.91. The prosecutor refused to provide the required consent to that sentencing option (see CPL 410.91 [4]) and County Court denied defendant’s challenge to the constitutionality of that requirement. Thereafter, pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of forgery in the second degree (see Penal Law § 170.10), in full satisfaction of the indictment, and was sentenced as a second felony offender to, inter alia, concurrent prison terms of 2 to 4 years. On appeal, defendant argues that the consent provision contained in CPL 410.91 (4) unconstitutionally violates the separation of powers doctrine by improperly delegating judicial authority to the executive branch.
Initially, we note that this Court recently addressed the same argument, in dicta, in People v Mack (304 AD2d 847, 848 [2003]), where we observed that the defendant failed to show “that CPL 410.91 (4) violates the separation of powers doctrine and is thus unconstitutional.” With that issue squarely before us herein, we reach the same conclusion. Notably, with respect to sentencing in criminal matters, there can be no dispute that “the ultimate determination of an appropriate sentence is to be made by the court” (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 307 [1981]). Nevertheless, the Legislature has full authority to create criminal offenses and also “to limit the sentencing options available to the judiciary [for those offenses]” (People v Eason, 40 NY2d 297, 301 [1976]). Accordingly, “[s]o long as a statute does not wrest from courts the final discretion to impose sentence, it does not infringe upon the constitutional division of responsibilities” (id. at 301 [emphasis in original]).
Here, while CPL 410.91 (4) limits a court’s discretion to the extent of requiring the prosecutor’s consent prior to the imposition of a parole supervision sentence, it does not constrain a court to sentence a defendant in any particular way. As such, defendant has failed in his “heavy burden” of establishing that CPL 410.91 (4) violates the separation of powers doctrine (People v Mack, supra at 848; see People v North St. Book Shoppe, 139 AD2d 118, 119 [1988], lv denied 72 NY2d 1048 [1988]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered March 11, 2016, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of all then-pending charges. Under the plea agreement, defendant agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the People’s recommendation of a three-year prison sentence and two years of post-release supervision with the understanding that County Court would consider him for placement in the Willard Drug Treatment Program or a shock incarceration program (see Correc tion Law art 26-A). At sentencing, County Court declined to place defendant in either the Willard program or a shock incarceration program and sentenced defendant to a prison term of three years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that his sentence is harsh and excessive because County Court rejected his request for placement in the Willard program or a shock incarceration program. The record reflects that County Court honored its commitment to consider defendant for placement in the Willard program and ultimately determined that it was not appropriate in this case given defendant’s criminal history (see People v Patterson, 119 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1046 [2014]; People v Tollman, 92 AD3d 1082, 1083 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1065 [2013]; compare People v Muhammad, 132 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2015]). Inasmuch as County Court found that a drug treatment program would not be appropriate or warranted given defendant’s criminal history, and defendant received the promised sentence, we find that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive (see People v Patterson, 119 AD3d at 1158-1159).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered April 2, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was sentenced upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree to a term of imprisonment of 6 to 18 years. On this appeal, defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive. As a part of his plea bargain, defendant waived possible indictment for the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging the less serious offense of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed. Further, as a part of the plea negotiation it was agreed that the People would not pursue other possible charges against defendant. Given these circumstances, as well as defendant’s criminal record, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered September 28, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We previously assigned new counsel to represent defendant on this appeal (301 AD2d 751, 751 [2003]) and now defendant’s sole legal argument is that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary or intelligent. This issue, however, has not been preserved for our review because defendant did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Thomas, 307 AD2d 592, 592 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 625 [2003]; People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914, 915 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 580 [2003]). Although defendant was initially hesitant to accept the negotiated plea agreement, County Court properly made further and repeated inquiries to ensure that defendant understood the nature of the charge and that the plea was intelligently and voluntarily entered and, thus, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]).
In any event, considering defendant’s claim, we find it to be without merit. The transcript of the plea proceedings discloses, that County Court went to great lengths to explain to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, taking special care to specifically address those matters about which defendant initially expressed confusion. After the court clarified these matters, defendant indicated that he understood them and conferred with counsel. While defendant initially professed ignorance of the cir cumstances of the crime, he ultimately admitted that he sold cocaine in Ulster County in August 1999. As the record makes clear, “[a]ny reluctance on the part of defendant in entering his guilty plea is attributable not to threats or coercion but to defendant’s ‘unhappiness with the harsh realities of his situation’ ” (People v Wilmer, 191 AD2d 850, 850-851 [1993], lv denied 81 NY2d 1022 [1993], quoting People v Jimenez, 179 AD2d 840 [1992], lv denied 79 NY2d 949 [1992]; see People v Evans, 193 AD2d 960, 961 [1993]).

"Mugglin, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered July 9, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance in satisfaction of a nine-count indictment. In exchange, it was agreed that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 2½ to 7½years. Defendant executed both a written waiver of his right to appeal and a Parker admonishment, wherein he acknowledged that his participation in any illegal conduct during the period of time between the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing would free County Court to impose any legal sentence, including the maximum sentence permitted by law (see People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141 [1982]). When defendant perpetrated the crime of bail jumping by failing to appear at his scheduled sentencing hearing, County Court sentenced him in absentia to an enhanced prison term of 5 to 15 years, a legal sentence (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]).
Defendant appeals the imposition of an enhanced sentence on the ground that County Court neglected to inform him at the plea hearing of the maximum sentence which could be imposed in the event that he failed to appear at the sentencing hearing. County Court advised defendant that if he failed to appear for sentencing, he “could be sentenced to any legal sentence upon conviction for a Class B felony, which is substantially greater exposure than 7½ years.” Defendant stated that he understood and defense counsel advised the court that he had discussed with defendant what that exposure would be, a fact confirmed by defendant’s written waiver of appeal. As a result, not only is defendant’s argument belied by the record, but the issue raised does not challenge the legality of the sentence and is, therefore, precluded by his waiver (see People v Caines, 268 AD2d 790, 791 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 833 [2000]).
As defendant was adequately advised concerning the maximum sentence that could be imposed, we decline to review his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733 [1998]; People v Fewell [Sawyer], 284 AD2d 563 [2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 681, 687 [2001]). Moreover, as defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel does not allege that the inadequacy of counsel affected the voluntary nature of his plea (see People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]), this claim is also precluded by his waiver. The remaining issues raised by defendant have been examined and found to be without merit.

"Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the County Court, Rockland County (Edelstein, J.), imposed September 9, 1986, upon his conviction of criminal sale of marihuana in the first degree and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, after a plea of guilty, the sentence being two concurrent terms of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years.
Ordered that the sentence is affirmed, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, for further proceedings pursuant to CPL 460.50 (5).
The County Court informed the defendant that he could not, in good conscience, impose the promised sentence due to the nature and extent of the crimes. The defendant was then offered the option of accepting the sentence actually imposed or withdrawing his guilty plea (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). The court gave the defendant an adjournment for more than one week to consider this and to make a decision. On the adjourned date, the defendant expressly stated that he would not withdraw his plea of guilty and would ""accept” the proposed sentence. The defendant had not so changed his position in reliance on the sentence promise that the withdrawal of his guilty plea would not have restored him to his original position (cf., People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340; People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169).

Defendant claims that the waiver of his right to appeal was invalid because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made. We note that defendant has failed to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the plea for our review insofar as he failed to move to vacate the judgment of conviction or to withdraw his plea. In any event, the record belies his assertion. Defendant’s waiver was part of a negotiated plea and the minutes of the plea hearing reveal that defendant fully understood the consequences of the waiver. In addition, even were we to address the merits of defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of 10 to 20 years was harsh and excessive, we would reject it. The sentence was well within the statutory limits and was imposed in accordance with the plea bargain. The plea was also entered into in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered February 8, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. At sentencing, County Court denied defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him, in accordance with the plea bargain, to a term of imprisonment of seven years to life. On this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in summarily dismissing his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
A review of the plea transcript reveals that defendant was aware of the conditions of the plea bargain. Further, defendant’s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and given without hesitation or protestation of innocence. Finally, County Court gave defendant an opportunity to state the basis for his withdrawal motion. Given these circumstances, we find no error in County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea.

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered May 2, 1994, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of an indictment charging her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and endangering the welfare of a child. The plea was entered with the express understanding that defendant would receive a prison term of six years to life if sentenced as a second felony offender or three years to life if not sentenced as a second felony offender, and accepted only upon the condition that defendant waive her right to appeal. Having entered the plea and waived her right to appeal, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to six years to life. Defendant now appeals contending that County Court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle in which she was a passenger and in adjudicating her as a second felony offender. We affirm.
In our view, defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived her right to appeal (see, People v Collier, 226 AD2d 923, lv denied 88 NY2d 935; People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958, lv denied 87 NY2d 1025; see also, People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, 830, cert denied 423 US 873). County Court’s statement on the record that defendant was waiving all her appellate rights except those constitutional issues that survive such a waiver under the principles enunciated in People v Seaberg (74 NY2d 1) neither preserved defendant’s right to appeal the denial of her suppression motion (see, CPL 710.70 [2]; see also, People v Dixon, 210 AD2d 532) nor gave her any reason to believe that she was not in fact waiving such right (see, People v Williams, supra, at 830; People v Scott, supra). Under these circumstances, the waiver of defendant’s right to appeal the denial of her suppression motion will be enforced.
As a final matter, in the absence of any substantiation that defendant’s prior felony conviction was unconstitutionally obtained (see, CPL 400.21 [7] [a], [b]), her sentence as a second felony offender was appropriate (see, People v Robare, 226 AD2d 832; People v Stevens, 218 AD2d 678, lv denied 87 NY2d 908).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered October 29, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of grand larceny in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of various charges, defendant pleaded guilty to grand larceny in the fourth degree as charged in a superior court information. Pursuant to the plea agreement, sentencing was adjourned and defendant was allowed to sign a contract to participate in a drug court program. It was understood that if defendant abided by the conditions of the contract, which included him completing the drug court program and not violating the law prior to the final disposition of the matter, he would be allowed to withdraw his plea and enter a plea to a misdemeanor. After completing the drug court program, but prior to being given an opportunity to withdraw his plea, defendant relapsed on several occasions and was also cited for driving without a license. Defendant thereafter filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to withdraw his plea to the felony charge pursuant to the plea agreement. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant pursuant to the felony conviction to time served and five years of probation. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that by successfully completing the drug court program, he fulfilled his obligation pursuant to the contract and, therefore, he should have been allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. The record reflects, however, that by signing the contract, defendant affirmed that he “understood] that even after [he] complete[s] drug court [he] must appear at all court dates and avoid further violations of the law until this matter is disposed of finally.” Defendant also affirmed his understanding that if he “violate [s] the law prior to final disposition of this matter, the [c]ourt will determine the appropriate sentence for the felony charge.” Although defendant successfully completed the drug court program, he subsequently used illegal drugs prior to the final disposition of the matter. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that County Court erred in sentencing defendant pursuant to the felony conviction, despite his successful completion of the drug court program (see People v Hicks, 98 NY2d 185, 189 [2002]; People v Coffey, 77 AD3d 1202, 1203-1204 [2010], lv denied 18 NY3d 882 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered June 21, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a 10-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. In exchange for his plea, defendant was promised a prison sentence of seven years conditioned upon, among other things, not committing any new offenses prior to sentencing. Shortly before sentencing, defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marihuana and possession of contraband in prison in the second degree. Defendant then admitted at sentencing that he had violated one of the conditions imposed by County Court at the time of his plea. County Court accordingly sentenced defendant, a second felony offender, to a prison term of eight years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and ordered him to pay $500 in restitution. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant argues that his plea was invalid because County Court failed to sufficiently advise him that he would be giving up certain rights by pleading guilty (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; see also Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015]). While this challenge survives defendant’s valid appeal waiver (see People v Klinger, 129 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2015]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1449 [2014]), it was not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion in the ample period between plea and sentencing (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1537 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]). In any event, the plea colloquy leaves no doubt that defendant was aware of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent decision to proceed (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d at 1538).
Defendant further contends that County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence because he was not advised of the possible maximum term of imprisonment that he could receive if he violated the terms and conditions of his plea. This contention is also unpreserved for our review due to defend ant’s failure to either object to the enhanced sentence or make an appropriate postallocution motion, and the record gives us no reason to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 984 [2014]; People v Overton, 105 AD3d 1072, 1072-1073 [2013]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Mclnerney, J.), rendered March 4, 1987, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The allegations upon which the defendant predicates his contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel are belied by his unequivocal responses to questions asked by the trial court during his plea allocution. The defendant informed the trial court that assigned counsel had discussed with him the defenses of agency and entrapment and denied that counsel had ever advised him that she would not defend him at a trial of the crimes charged in the indictment if he declined the plea agreement and requested a trial. The record reveals that counsel provided the defendant with ""meaningful representation” (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).
Furthermore, the indeterminate sentence of from 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment imposed upon the defendant’s conviction of a class B felony was a proper exercise of the court’s discretion and we decline to substitute our discretion for that of the sentencing court. The sentence imposed was the result of a negotiated plea agreement which substantially reduced the defendant’s sentencing exposure. Therefore, he cannot now complain that the sentence was unduly harsh or excessive (see, People v Perkins, 130 AD2d 521, lv denied 70 NY2d 716; People v Carbone, 117 AD2d 612, lv denied 67 NY2d 881; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

"Stein, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered October 6, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
As the result of an investigation into narcotics trafficking by the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and 36 codefendants were named in a 278-count sealed indictment which, among other things, charged defendant with conspiracy in the second degree and 24 drug felonies. In satisfaction of that indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, defendant, a second felony offender, was offered a sentence of no more than 10 years in prison, upon the condition that, among other things, he “cooperate]” with the prosecution. Prior to sentencing, the People informed County Court that defendant had violated the plea agreement by refusing to speak with the prosecution. Consequently, the court imposed an enhanced sentence of 14 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Initially, defendant challenges County Court’s imposition of an enhanced sentence, claiming that the nature of defendant’s obligation to cooperate was not sufficiently clarified. Although such argument survives his appeal waiver, inasmuch as defendant did not object to the enhanced sentence on that basis and the record does not indicate that he made an appropriate postal-locution motion, this claim is not preserved for our review (see People v Stanley, 100 AD3d 1152, 1152-1153 [2012]; People v Gabbidon, 96 AD3d 1235, 1236 [2012]). In any event, while the cooperation component of the plea agreement was not described in detail, it clearly obligated defendant to, at the very least, speak to the prosecution, which he flatly refused to do. Inasmuch as defendant violated any reasonable interpretation of the cooperation agreement, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see People v Fleming, 50 AD3d 1390, 1391 [2008]; People v James, 251 AD2d 813, 815 [1998]; compare People v Stanley, 100 AD3d at 1153).
Defendant’s related claim that his trial counsel’s failure to properly advise him of the full implications of the cooperation agreement deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel— which also survives the appeal waiver because it implicates the voluntariness of his plea — is likewise unpreserved (see People v Lohnes, 112 AD3d 1148, 1150 [2013]; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1379-1380 [2013]; People v Youngblood, 107 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1078 [2013]) and does not merit the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction. Moreover, to the extent that it is properly before us, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s argument that his counsel was ineffective by failing to request a hearing on the issue of his compliance with the cooperation agreement.
Finally, we reject defendant’s assertion that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive. Given defendant’s failure to comply with the plea agreement, coupled with his lengthy criminal record, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Jordan, 111 AD3d 970, 971 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Sgueglia, J.), rendered February 14, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, the first count of a five-count indictment against him. In connection with the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court advised defendant of the rights that he was relinquishing as a part of this particular plea bargain, then delegated responsibility for conducting the plea allocution to defense counsel, informing defendant, without obtaining a waiver of the right to counsel, that counsel was “no longer representing you in the sense of protecting you.” Defense counsel then conducted the factual portion of the plea allocution. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant to eight years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, arguing that his plea was not voluntary and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
Defendant’s allegations regarding the right to counsel at the plea proceeding implicate the voluntariness of his plea and, thus, they are not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Wright, 21 AD3d 583, 583-584 [2005], lvs denied 5 NY3d 857 [2005], 6 NY3d 820 [2006]; People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]). Moreover, while defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Grant, 294 AD2d 671, 672 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 730 [2002]; People v Goodings, 277 AD2d 725, 725 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 735 [2001]), “a violation of the right to counsel may be reviewed in the absence of an objection” (People v Dean, 47 NY2d 967, 968 [1979]; cf. People v Montanez, 287 AD2d 407, 408 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 685 [2001]).
Although “[t]he fact that [an] attorney participates in the plea allocution does not. . . necessarily constitute reversible er ror” when the allocution is performed under the court’s supervision and the right to counsel is adequately safeguarded (People v Empey, 141 AD2d 987, 988 [1988]; see People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 350 [1967], cert denied 393 US 1067 [1969]; People v Skinner, 284 AD2d 906, 907 [2001]; People v Sanchez, 284 AD2d 137, 137 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 942 [2001]), we have long criticized the practice of courts delegating the duty to conduct the plea allocution (see People v Bonneau, 142 AD2d 890, 890-891 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 889 [1989]; People v Maye, 129 AD2d 204, 205-206 [1987]). Moreover, here, County Court announced that not only did it intend to delegate the allocution in its entirety with respect to the factual basis of the plea but also that, at its urging, counsel would take a position adverse to defendant during a critical stage of the proceedings (see generally People v Settles, 46 NY2d 154, 165-166 [1978]; People v Lewis, 286 AD2d 934, 935 [2001]; People v Santana, 156 AD2d 736, 737 [1989], lv denied 79 NY2d 863 [1992]). Under these circumstances, we agree with defendant that his plea was rendered involuntary and, thus, reversal is required.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered January 18, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of an indictment and a pending misdemeanor charge, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree, a class E felony (see, Penal Law § 221.45), with the understanding that the People would recommend that defendant serve at least four months in jail. As a part of the plea agreement, defendant agreed to pay restitution in a specified sum and waived his right to appeal. Following a sentencing hearing, County Court sentenced defendant to five years’ probation, 120 days in jail, the agreed-upon restitution and 50 hours of community service. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant contends that his guilty plea and waiver of the right to appeal were coerced by the ineffective assistance of his counsel and other surrounding circumstances. Although defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not in and of itself preclude our review (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1), defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders defendant’s arguments unpreserved for our review (see, People v Smith, 271 AD2d 752, 753; People v Russell, 237 AD2d 841, 842, lv denied 90 NY2d 897). Nonetheless, were we to review the arguments, we would find them to be lacking in merit. Our review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal with the benefit of meaningful assistance from his counsel (see, People v Ireland, 274 AD2d 743; People v Victor, 262 AD2d 872, 873, lv denied 94 NY2d 830).
Turning to the legality of the sentence imposed, defendant contends, and the People concede, that County Court improperly imposed a sentence of community service. Penal Law § 65.10 (2) (h) permits a sentence of community service for a class E felony conviction only where “the defendant has consented to the amount and conditions of such service.” Defendant’s consent to the possibility of community service may not be inferred from the plea allocution and the record is otherwise devoid of any indication that defendant actually consented to the terms and conditions of community service imposed at the time of sentencing. Accordingly, the sentence of community service was not authorized and the matter must be remitted for resentencing (see, People v Tice, 267 AD2d 504, 505; People v Suros, 209 AD2d 203, lv denied 85 NY2d 943, cert denied 516 US 862).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 24, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court subsequently sentenced him in accor dance with the negotiated plea agreement to a prison term of 6 to 12 years. Defendant then appealed and this Court rejected an Anders brief and assigned new counsel (31 AD3d 817 [2006]). We now affirm.
Defendant asserts that County Court coerced him into pleading guilty and, therefore, his plea must be set aside as invalid. Such an assertion, however, is unpreserved for our review given defendant’s failure to move for withdrawal of his plea or vacatur of the judgment of conviction (see People v Perez, 35 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2006]). In any event, a review of the plea proceedings satisfies us that defendant’s guilty plea was not the subject of coercion and that he entered it voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see People v Keebler, 15 AD3d 724, 726 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 854 [2005]).
Defendant also contends that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as the record reveals that defendant did not validly waive his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]), we have considered this issue on the merits, yet discern neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the lawful, agreed-upon sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Marshall, 25 AD3d 876, 877 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 850 [2006]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Berke, J.), rendered May 16, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.
Defendant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of IV2 to 3 years. On appeal, he contends that any jail time is harsh and excessive and requests that his sentence be modified to only require that he complete a specific mental illness and substance abuse treatment program. In light of defendant’s extensive criminal record, including three prior felony convictions, and his failure to take full advantage of other treatment programs previously made available to him, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Hollenback, 234 AD2d 824, lv denied 89 NY2d 986; People v Stalter, 212 AD2d 936). Contrary to defendant’s contention, neither his substance abuse nor his psychiatric problems constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention (see, People v Soares, 224 AD2d 830; People v Weill, 170 AD2d 890). We have reviewed defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered April 25, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends on this appeal that his sentence of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. The record reveals that defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal from the judgment as a part of his plea agreement (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 5; People v Bennett, 152 AD2d 886, 887, lv denied 74 NY2d 845) and the judgment must therefore be affirmed (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273). Were we to consider the merits of defendant’s argument, we would find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court given that defendant’s plea was in satisfaction of one 10-count indictment and another six-count indictment and defendant knew that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, which was less than the harshest possible sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered November 8, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In May 2000, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. After defendant failed to appear at the arraignment, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. More than two years later, after defendant was located in Florida and brought to New York, he pleaded guilty to the first count of the indictment, which was reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, in full satisfaction of all charges. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal and was to be sentenced to four years to life in prison. Defendant was sentenced as agreed and appealed. This Court rejected a previous Anders brief and assigned new counsel (12 AD3d 723 [2004]).
Initially, inasmuch as defendant neither moved to withdraw the plea nor vacate the judgment of conviction, he is precluded from challenging the voluntariness of his plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Daniels, 16 AD3d 780, 780 [2005]; People v Brown, 309 AD2d 1084, 1084 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 595 [2004]). In any event, our review of the record discloses that defendant was fully advised of the ramifications of pleading guilty and indicated that he understood. Accordingly, we find that both the plea and waiver were knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered. Defendant’s voluntary waiver of appeal encompasses his claims that the search and seizure was illegal and that his statutory speedy trial right was violated (see People v Newsome, 17 AD3d 785 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d 819, 820 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]). Although the waiver does not extend to his constitutional right to a speedy trial, this claim has not been preserved inasmuch as it is raised for the first time on this appeal (see People v Robinson, 1 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 745 [2004]; People v Haas, 229 AD2d 733, 734 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 1021 [1996]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered November 23, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered January 30, 2007, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction.
Upon the execution of a search warrant at an apartment located in the City of Albany, defendant was found in possession of heroin. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he later pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. His posttrial motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and the order denying his motion to vacate.
With regard to defendant’s claims on his direct appeal, we cannot agree with the People’s contention that defendant effectively waived his right to appeal. The record of the plea colloquy does not adequately reflect, as the Court of Appeals has indicated it must in a decision subsequent to this plea, that “defendant understood that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]) or that his oral appeal waiver was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]; see also People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]).
However, we find—contrary to defendant’s contentions—that his plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]). The plea minutes reflect that defendant was advised of—and indicated he understood—the trial-related rights he would be foregoing by entering a guilty plea, and of the consequences of so doing; he indicated he had a full chance to discuss the proof with his attorney, that his plea was a voluntary choice, and that he was entering a plea because he was in fact guilty. Defendant then answered in the affirmative when asked if he was in possession of more than a one-half ounce of heroin on the date, time and location as alleged in the indictment (which were recited at the plea), and he entered a valid guilty plea. Defendant made no statements which cast doubt on his guilt or his understanding of the plea, or were inconsistent with guilt or negated an element of the crime so as to trigger County Court’s duty to question him further (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1260 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]). It was not required that defendant himself recite the elements of the crime or to engage in a recitation of the underlying facts (see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780, 781 [2005]; People v Williams, 35 AD3d 971, 972 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 928 [2007]).
Upon consideration of the mitigating factors urged by defendant, we are not persuaded that the agreed-upon eight-year sentence—which represents a midrange second felony offender sentence for this class B drug felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i] [3Va to 12-year range])—is harsh or excessive. Finding no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances, we decline to reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; 470.20 [6]).
Defendant further argues that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel based upon counsel’s alleged deficient conduct related to his suppression motions and misadvice concerning his right to appeal following his guilty plea. Defendant also argues that his pro se motion to vacate on those grounds was improperly denied without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [1] [h]; 440.30). We find, however, that County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying defendant’s motion without a hearing, which was supported only by his affidavit reciting the chronology of his case, given the absence of any “sworn allegations” (CPL 440.30 [4] [b]) substantiating his allegations that suppression was warranted or that defense counsel provided inadequate representation, allegations which were otherwise unsupported (see CPL 440.30 [4] [d]; see also People v Woodard, 23 AD3d 771 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 782 [2006]). Also, upon review of the record as a whole, we do not find that defendant was deprived of meaningful representation by trial counsel (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]). Defendant’s remaining claims lack merit.

Appeal from an order of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), entered June 13, 2003, which granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment.
Defendant was arrested in 1997 when a search of his apartment resulted in the discovery of cocaine. Since a person residing temporarily at his apartment was the primary suspect and defendant’s role was viewed as minor, he was offered a plea agreement whereby he would serve no more than five years probation with four months of weekends in jail. The deal fell through when, during the plea allocution, defendant denied knowing that the individual residing at his apartment was involved in possessing and selling drugs. Defendant was then indicted for, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony. He was convicted and, although County Court indicated a lesser sentence would be more appropriate, it was constrained to impose the minimum permissible jail term of 15 years to life.
We reversed based upon errors at the trial (301 AD2d 673 [2003]) and, upon remittal, defendant and the People were unable to agree to the terms of a plea. Defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment in the furtherance of justice. After conducting a hearing on the motion, County Court rendered a detailed written decision addressing each of the statutory factors (see CPL 210.40 [1]) and concluding that dismissal was appropriate. The People appeal.
We affirm. Dismissal of an indictment in the furtherance of justice is a remedy, that should be sparingly employed in the limited situations where such relief is supported by compelling reasons (see People v Rickert, 58 NY2d 122, 128 [1983]; People v Kennard, 266 AD2d 718, 719 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 864 [1999]; People v Litman, 99 AD2d 573, 574 [1984]). Here, County Court noted its “tremendous concern” in the disparity between the initial plea offer and the subsequent minimum available sentence after conviction. The court set forth its further concern about the People’s decision to go from a position that defendant had minimal involvement to one of seeking an indictment for an A-I felony. Defendant, who is 57 years old and has serious health problems, served four years in jail before his conviction was reversed. The drug laws under which he was sentenced have been the subject of debate and some recent reform (see L 2004, ch 738). After the reversal, defendant was released on his own recognizance, obtained employment, enrolled in programs directed at addressing his past substance abuse problems and volunteered in community organizations. The court was convinced that defendant had adequately addressed and reformed his personal drug problem. Character witnesses appeared for defendant and the court found their testimony persuasive. County Court stated that there was “nothing to remotely suggest that the community is at risk by [defendant’s] return” and observed that “it is quite plausible that [defendant] will be an asset to the community.” County Court observed that, while defendant acknowledged possessing a small amount of cocaine for personal use, the evidence that he knew about the alleged larger transactions of a co-inhabitant of the apartment was circumstantial and defendant had consistently maintained his innocence in such regard. Upon review of the record, we are unpersuaded that County Court abused its discretion in finding that this case constituted a limited situation where dismissal in the furtherance of justice was warranted (see People v Wong, 227 AD2d 852, 853 [1996]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Meyer, J.), rendered September 28, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and welfare fraud in the fifth degree.
In June 2011, defendant waived indictment and agreed to prosecution by a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and welfare fraud in the fifth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to all charges and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, as a second felony drug offender, to seven years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on each drug conviction and one year in jail on the welfare conviction, to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claim that the third count of the superior court information—charging him with welfare fraud in the fifth degree—is jurisdictionally defective survives his guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see People v Kamburelis, 100 AD3d 1189, 1189-1190 [2012]; People v Hurell-Harring, 66 AD3d 1126, 1127 n 1 [2009]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as the information specifically refers to Penal Law § 158.05 (1) and charges that defendant “did commit a fraudulent welfare act and thereby takes or obtains public assistance benefits,” it apprises defendant of the charges and is, therefore, sufficient to survive a jurisdictional challenge (see People v Kamburelis, 100 AD3d at 1189-1190; People v McDuffie, 89 AD3d 1154, 1155 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 964 [2012]). To the extent that he challenges the factual sufficiency of the superior court information with respect to the welfare charge, such contention is unpreserved by his failure to timely object and is further precluded by his guilty plea (see People v Young, 100 AD3d 1186, 1188 [2012]; People v Quinones, 51 AD3d 1226, 1227 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 938 [2008]). Defendant’s remaining contentions, including his challenge to the severity of his sentence, are precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Boone, 101 AD3d 1358, 1359 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1096 [2013]; People v Anderson, 99 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1009 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered September 9, 2005, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following a four-day trial at which 10 witnesses testified, defendant was convicted of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. At sentencing, defendant executed a waiver of his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4V2 to 9 years. Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal (see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]).
Upon our review of the record, we perceive at least one issue of arguable merit regarding the validity of defendant’s waiver of appeal (see People v Lewis, 29 AD3d 1076, 1076-1077 [2006]; People v Santalucia, 9 AD3d 740, 740-741 [2004]; see also People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 555-556 [2006]), and a determination of the enforceability of defendant’s waiver may bring up for review any meritorious issues regarding, among other things, the pretrial procedures and hearings and the four-day trial which resulted in defendant’s conviction (see People v Santalucia, 9 AD3d at 740; see also Matter of Taylor v Fry, 42 AD3d 680, 681 [2007]). Accordingly, the application of defendant’s current counsel to be relieved of his assignment is granted and new counsel will be assigned to address any issues that the record may disclose (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered February 28, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
When defendant was arraigned on a multicount indictment, his attorney advised County Court that English was defendant’s second language and was not the language ""in which he usually does business”. In response to County Court’s inquiry, defendant indicated he understood English and then proceeded to answer appropriately the other pro forma questions County Court asked him during the arraignment. Thereafter, in paragraph 73 of an omnibus motion, defendant’s attorney applied for the appointment of an interpreter or an additional counsel fluent in Spanish because defendant did not speak English well enough for him to be able to fully and adequately represent him. County Court denied the application with leave to renew for good cause shown. The application was not renewed and thereafter defendant entered into a plea bargain,
ultimately pleading guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of four years to life. This appeal ensued.
It is a well-established precept of due process that non-English speaking defendants in criminal actions are entitled to an interpreter so that they can meaningfully participate in the trial and assist in their own defense (see, United States v Mosquera, 816 F Supp 168, 173; People v Ramos, 26 NY2d 272, 274; People v Robles, 203 AD2d 172, 174,, revd on other grounds 86 NY2d 763). In the instant case, although the better practice would have been for County Court to hold a hearing to evaluate defendant’s ability to speak and understand English, a review of the entire record reveals a 29-year-old defendant who was born in Chicago, Illinois, attended school in the Bronx through age 13 and has lived in the Bronx or Manhattan for most of his life. Further, the record discloses a presentence investigation report in which the defendant provided, with no apparent language difficulty, a detailed account of the plea bargain, his participation in the offense in question, his finances, family background, education, employment and physical condition. Thus, based on the entire record, we find no merit to the defendant’s contention that he was unable to speak and understand English.
Defendant challenges the sufficiency of his plea allocution. Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or to vacate his judgment of conviction and, accordingly, this issue raised for the first time on this appeal was not preserved for appellate review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662), and the record reveals no support for defendant’s contention that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because of a lack of fluency in English (see, People v Ferrer, 158 AD2d 315).
Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is also without merit. The record, viewed as a whole, reveals that defendant was represented in a competent and meaningful manner (see, People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796), and defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was deprived of a fair proceeding by less than meaningful representation (see, People v Flores, 84 NY2d .184, 187). Finally, defendant’s sentence cannot be described as excessive considering that more than one pound of cocaine was involved. We find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances with defendant’s sentencing and decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Kenny, 175 AD2d 404, 407, Iv denied 78 NY2d 1012). We have reviewed defendant’s remaining contentions and find them without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 23, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant signed a waiver of indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to that charge and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to receive a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison with shock program eligibility. County Court informed defendant that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if any additional crimes were committed prior to sentencing. At the time of sentencing, it was discovered that defendant had pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in Nassau County. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant to 4 to 12 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends, inter alia, that his waivers of indictment and the right to appeal must be invalidated because they were not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. Initially, we note that by failing to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant has not preserved his challenge to his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Gonzalez, 299 AD2d 581, 582; People v Holland, 270 AD2d 718, lv denied 95 NY2d 798). Likewise, “[t]he issue of the validity of his waiver of indictment is also unpreserved for review as it was forfeited by defendant’s guilty plea” (People v Gonzalez, supra at 582).
Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of defendant’s claims, we would find them unpersuasive. During the course of the plea proceedings, County Court inquired as to whether defendant voluntarily executed the waivers, had an opportunity to discuss them with his attorney and understood the rights he was relinquishing by signing them. Defendant answered these questions in the affirmative. Moreover, the terms of the waivers, which were executed in open court, clearly set forth their ramifications and were signed by both defendant and his attorney. Under these circumstances, we find that the waivers were knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see id.; People v Catalfamo, 228 AD2d 786, 787).
Defendant further asserts that his waiver of the right to appeal should be annulled and the plea agreement set aside because he was not informed of the maximum sentence that could be imposed in the event he violated the terms of the plea agreement. He seeks to have the enhanced sentence invalidated as harsh and excessive. “[W]e have held that where a defendant who concomitantly validly pleaded guilty and waived all appeal rights receives an enhanced sentence based upon a violation of the terms of the plea agreement, any claim addressed to the harshness or excessiveness of the enhanced sentence falls within the scope of the waiver of the right to appeal, provided the defendant is informed of the maximum potential sentence for noncompliance with the plea agreement” (People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800; see People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827; People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513). Although County Court advised defendant during the plea proceedings that it would not be bound by the agreed-upon sentence if defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement, it did not inform him of the maximum sentence that could be imposed. Consequently, defendant is not precluded from challenging the severity of his sentence. Nevertheless, we do not find any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Shea, supra at 513). We have considered defendant’s remaining claims and find them to be unavailing.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered June 21, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
• In exchange for defendant’s plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, it was agreed that he would be sentenced as a second felony of fender to a prison term of 2V2 to 5 years. The agreement was conditioned upon defendant’s appearance at the sentencing hearing before County Court and his abstention from additional criminal activity during the interim. Prior to sentencing, defendant was again arrested on a drug-related charge. As a result, he accepted the terms of a revised agreement pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 to 7 years, and his most recent drug-related charge, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was dismissed. Defendant appeals, seeking a reduction of his sentence in the interest of justice.
In view of defendant’s lengthy history of drug-related crimes and his apparent inability to refrain from this activity, we find that the prison term imposed by County Court was appropriate (see People v Hill, 291 AD2d 730; People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917). Defendant’s admitted drug addiction and need for rehabilitation do not constitute extraordinary circumstances that would warrant modification of his sentence in the interest of justice, given the opportunities he has received to participate in drug rehabilitation programs and his repeated failure to benefit from them (see People v Baker, 293 AD2d 820, 822, lv denied 98 NY2d 708). The remaining contentions raised on defendant’s behalf have been reviewed and found to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered February 2, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment charging defendant with various drug crimes, defendant pleaded guilty in July 2002 to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Before he could be sentenced, however, defendant absconded and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was ultimately returned to County Court’s jurisdiction in 2004 and sentenced, as a second felony offender and in accordance with the plea agreement, to a prison term of 3 to 6 years. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial (see CEL 30.30). Upon our review of the record, we find that defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea operated as a waiver of his right to seek appellate review of this issue (see People v Friscia, 51 NY2d 845, 847 [1980]; People v Cintron, 7 AD3d 827, 828 [2004]; People v Attanasio, 240 AD2d 877, 877-878 [1997]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered January 8, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a hypodermic needle.
In September 1997, defendant was found to be in possession of a large quantity of marihuana and was growing it around his home, which he shared with his girlfriend and their two young children. He and his girlfriend were charged in an indictment with various crimes relating thereto and were jointly represented throughout the course of the proceedings. Ultimately, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a hypodermic needle in full satisfaction of the indictment. As part of the plea agreement, the District Attorney agreed to allow defendant’s girlfriend to plead guilty to two counts of the indictment, and to be sentenced to a $1,000 fine and a three-year period of probation. Both defendant and his girlfriend waived their rights to appeal. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to a definite one-year jail term on his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and concurrent six-month jail terms on the remaining charges. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s assigned appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of representing defendant on the ground that there are no non-frivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, however, has filed a pro se submission contesting appellate counsel’s position, arguing that his trial counsel improperly refused his request to withdraw the plea at sentencing and the search of his premises was illegal. Initially, we note that defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerns matters outside the present record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Carroll [Barile], 299 AD2d 572, 572-573 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 625, 626 [2003]; People v Perez, 198 AD2d 540, 542 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 929 [1994]). In any event, our review of the record discloses that defendant was fully informed of the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the rights he was waiving thereby. Defendant stated on the record that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and was satisfied with the services of his attorney. Accordingly, defendant’s plea and waiver were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Angus, 303 AD2d 829, 830 [2003]; People v King, 299 AD2d 661, 662 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 583 [2003]). Defendant is precluded by his voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from now challenging the legality of the search (see People v Castano, 302 AD2d 686, 687 [2003]; People v Scott, 222 AD2d 958, 959 [1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 1025 [1996]). Inasmuch as our review does not reveal any nonfrivolous issues of arguable merit (cf. People v Shaw, 301 AD2d 751 [2003]; People v Vahedi, 299 AD2d 662 [2002]), defense counsel’s application is granted and the judgment is affirmed (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Sgueglia, J.), rendered June 8, 2007, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and sentenced to 4x/2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
While the prison term defendant received was greater than that apparently offered during the course of failed plea negotiations or sought by the People at sentencing, there is nothing in the record to suggest that defendant received a greater sentence in retaliation for electing to proceed to trial (see People v Torra, 309 AD2d 1074, 1076 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 581 [2003]). The record does, however, reflect that defendant received an additional six months in prison based solely upon what County Court apparently deemed to be an interrupting remark made by defendant during sentencing. Under such circumstances, we agree that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, reduce defendant’s sentence to four years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered January 23, 1987, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was arrested on November 20, 1986 and charged with a violation of Penal Law § 220.18 (1), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony. He was arraigned before a Justice of the local criminal court of an adjoining town due to the unavailability of the Justice of the appropriate town court to whom the felony complaint and all other pertinent documents were transferred for further preliminary proceedings. However, the complaint and related documents were not received and no further proceedings transpired in the local criminal court. Instead, plea negotiations were entered into by defendant’s attorney and the Assistant District Attorney and an application by the People and defendant to County Court for waiver of indictment and arraignment upon a superior court information charging one count of a violation of Penal Law § 220.18 (1) was granted (see, CPL 195.10). Thereafter, in accordance with a negotiated plea, defendant pleaded guilty to a violation of Penal Law § 220.16 (12), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 3 Vs to 10 years. This appeal ensued.
We reverse. A waiver of indictment wherein the charge in the felony complaint is a class A felony is constitutionally impermissible and a nullity (NY Const, art I, § 6; CPL 195.10; People v Sledge, 90 AD2d 588, lv denied 58 NY2d 977). Accordingly, defendant’s plea of guilty must be vacated, the superior court information dismissed, and the matter remitted to the court of original jurisdiction for further proceedings on the felony complaint.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 11, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered March 10, 2003, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
In satisfaction of an 11-count indictment charging him with committing various drug-related felonies in September and October 1999, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, as reduced on the People’s motion. Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon concurrent sentences of SVs years to life on each count. Defendant later moved to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 claiming that the evidence against him had been illegally obtained, he was under duress at the time of the plea and he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. In a written decision, County Court denied the motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals from both the judgment of conviction and, by permission, the order denying his motion.
We affirm. Initially, although County Court granted defendant’s omnibus request for Huntley and Mapp hearings prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty while those suppression motions were pending and before a hearing was held or a decision rendered. He has, as a result, forfeited all claims related to those pending motions, including the claim that his statement to police was illegally obtained (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d 746, 747 [2004]; see also People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688 [1986]). Likewise, defendant’s guilty plea waived his contention that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient, claims rejected by a decision of County Court on defendant’s motion (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 233 [2000]; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 88-89 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 642 [2002]).
Next, we reject defendant’s contentions that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel or that his guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance in that counsel failed to pursue suppression motions (see People v Williams [June], 299 AD2d 580, 580 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 616, 621 [2003]). Given the uncertainty of success on the pretrial motions and the very favorable plea agreement—which disposed of numerous A-level felonies, entailed less than maximum sentences for the A-II felonies, and avoided possible consecutive sentences—defendant failed to demonstrate either the absence of a legitimate or strategic reason in advising him to forego a decision on the pending suppression motions and accept the then-available plea deal, or that counsel’s representation was less than meaningful (see People v Whitehurst, supra at 89; see also People v Garcia, 75 NY2d 973, 974 [1990]; People v Chevalier, 226 AD2d 925, 929 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 934 [1996]). Moreover, during the plea colloquy, County Court specifically elicited from defendant that he had discussed the plea with counsel and was satisfied with his services (see People v Whitehurst, supra at 89; People v Chevalier, supra at 929). A review of the colloquy also reflects that the court advised defendant of the terms of the plea agreement and apprised him of the consequences of pleading guilty and the rights he was foregoing—eliciting that he understood and allowing him to confer with counsel—and demonstrates that he agreed to the plea terms in full; thereafter, defendant admitted the conduct and entered a guilty plea which was, in all respects, knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d at 747).
We further find unpersuasive defendant’s contention that the agreed-upon concurrent prison sentences of SVs years to life are harsh and excessive and should be reduced to the minimum sentence of six years. As a second felony offender, defendant could have received consecutive sentences of I2V2 years to life on each of these distinct A-II felonies (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [a]; [4] [a]; § 70.25 [2]). There being no extraordinary circumstances in the record, we find no basis upon which to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in imposing the agreed-upon sentence (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; see also People v Mason, 2 AD3d 1207, 1207-1208 [2003]).
In view of the foregoing, and upon review of defendant’s submissions, we find that County Court properly denied defendant’s CPL article 440 motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [2], [3]; 440.30 [2]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J), rendered July 8, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In March 2008, defendant was charged in an indictment with various counts of criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance arising out of two sales of cocaine in the presence of an undercover officer. Subsequently, defendant was charged in an indictment with multiple counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance after cocaine was found in his pocket when police executed a no-knock warrant on the apartment of an acquaintance. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the second indictment. He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the bargained for prison term of four years and three years of postrelease supervision on the first charge and 21h years and two years of postrelease supervision on the second charge, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Initially, defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution regarding the offense charged in the second indictment is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d 853, 854 [2009]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1133 [2008]). We also find that the narrow exception to the preservation rule does not apply because defendant made no statements during the allocution that served to cast doubt upon his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Davis-Ivery, 59 AD3d at 854; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d at 1133; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]). In any event, contrary, to defendant’s contention, it was not necessary that he recite every element of the crime or engage in a factual recitation, inasmuch as his affirmative responses to County Court’s questions established the elements of the crime charged (see People v Kaszubinski, 55 AD3d 1133, 1136 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 855 [2009]; People v Johnson, 54 AD3d at 1133-1134; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d at 967).
Defendant’s claim that County Court erred because it did not advise him at the time of his guilty plea that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender is similarly unpreserved by defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mayers, 74 NY2d 931, 931-932 [1989]; People v Kopy, 54 AD3d 441, 441 [2008]; People v Granan, 48 AD3d 975, 975-976 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 959 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered December 3, 1984, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a minimum term of one year and a maximum term of three years. This sentence did not exceed that which was agreed to by defendant as a condition of his plea. Accordingly, since defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we must dismiss the appeal (CPL 450.10; People v Terry, 114 AD2d 657).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (Ryan, J.), rendered May 23, 2002, which resentenced defendant following his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In full satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. After defendant’s original sentence was vacated by this Court (293 AD2d 916), County Court resentenced him to an indeterminate prison term of five years to life. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole claim on this appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. He asserts that considering his age, educational and working background, limited criminal history and the fact that other participants in the same drug ring received more lenient sentences, he should have been sentenced to an indeterminate term of three years to life.
We are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed is harsh or excessive. It is well settled that “ ‘[t]he imposition of the sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we should not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances’ ” (People v King, 293 AD2d 815, 817-818, lv denied 98 NY2d 698, quoting People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663, 663). Here, considering the large quantity of drugs sold by defendant (see People v Chester, 297 AD2d 862) and the fact that his sentence was less than the maximum authorized (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]; People v Bailey, 295 AD2d 632, 635), we find no reason to modify the sentence in the interest of justice {see CPL 470.15 [6]). Moreover, the mere fact that defendant received a greater sentence than that of other participants does not mandate a reduction of his sentence by this Court (see People v Durrence, 244 AD2d 728, 728, lv denied 91 NY2d 925; People v Revels, 191 AD2d 905).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Cort land County (DiStefano, J.), entered April 12, 2002, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing.
Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a 16-count indictment charging him with, inter alia, five counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree involving five separate sales of cocaine on five separate occasions to the same State Police investigator. Defendant waived his right to appeal and thereafter was sentenced, in accordance with such plea bargain, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4V2 to 9 years. Defendant thereafter moved pursuant to CPL article 440 to vacate his judgment of conviction upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. That motion was denied and this appeal ensued.
We affirm. The crux of defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is that his assigned attorney advised him that he had no viable agency defense in view of the five separate sales asserted in the indictment and, further, that if defendant went to trial he was “almost certain to lose,” thereby subjecting himself to potential consecutive sentences. As aptly observed by County Court, counsel’s advise was realistic, appropriate and, given the extremely favorable plea bargain, hardly ineffective (see e.g. People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 398). We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered July 30, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty as charged to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. County Court thereafter sentenced him to eight years in prison, to be followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision, with the sentence to run concurrently to a sentence he was currently serving. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Initially, defendant’s contention that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel were not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Trombley, 115 AD3d 1114, 1114 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1068 [2014]). As to the plea, we note that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was triggered by defendant’s initial denial during the plea colloquy that he had the intent to sell the narcotics, thus negating an element of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (see Penal Law § 220.16 [1]), and triggering a duty on the part of County Court to conduct further inquiry (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Peterson, 124 AD3d 993, 994 [2015]; People v Morehouse, 109 AD3d 1022, 1022 [2013]). However, the record reveals that the court did then conduct sufficient further inquiry of defendant to confirm that he understood the nature of the charge and ensure the validity of the plea, and defendant thereafter admitted to having the requisite intent to sell. “ [A] s defendant failed to express any dissatisfaction with the court’s remedial action in this regard, defendant has waived any further challenge to his allocution” (People v English, 100 AD3d 1147, 1148 [2012]; see People v Karolys, 85 AD3d 1213 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 818 [2011]). Accordingly, we find that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d at 667-668; People v Howard, 119 AD3d 1090, 1090 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 961 [2014]).
Finally, as to defendant’s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive, the record reveals no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence (see People v Harold, 123 AD3d 1237, 1238 [2014]; People v Terry, 122 AD3d 955, 956 [2014]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 14, 1991, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and assault in the second degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice. The record reveals that, on November 30, 1990, defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced as a youthful offender to six months in the County Jail with five years’ probation as long as he did not engage in any criminal conduct between the time of the plea and the date of sentencing. Defendant was also warned that he could then be sentenced up to 8⅓ to 25 years in prison. During this time period, however, defendant was charged in two separate indictments for additional drug offenses and assault in the second degree. In addition, at least two felony complaints were outstanding against defendant charging him with at least two additional felonies. After new plea negotiations, defendant entered a second plea of guilty on March 14, 1991 to assault in the second degree in satisfaction of the remaining indictment, the felony complaints and new allegations regarding incidents that occurred the previous day at the jail. After taking into consideration all of these factors as well as the nature of the crimes involved, County Court sentenced defendant as promised to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years for the criminal possession conviction and 2Vs to 7 years for the assault conviction. Under these circumstances, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Henao, 149 AD2d 531, 532; People v Aia, 105 AD2d 592, 593; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Nicandri, J.), rendered January 29, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered January 29, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (3) by permission, from an order of said court, entered October 2, 2002, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his convictions, without a hearing.
In satisfaction of two indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. The plea agreement contained no promises as to the sentence, and County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 7V2 to 15 years. Thereafter, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside his sentence, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney told him that the plea agreement included a promise of 4x/2 to 9 years’ imprisonment. County Court denied that motion without a hearing. Defendant now appeals from the judgments of conviction and, by permission, from County Court’s denial of his CPL 440.20 motion.
Defendant’s assigned counsel seeks to be relieved of representing defendant on the direct appeals from his convictions on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant has responded with pro se submissions raising issues as to the legality of a search of his premises and the effectiveness of trial counsel. As a result of defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, he “may not now challenge the legality of the search” (People v Castano, 302 AD2d 686, 687 [2003]; see People v Hemingway, 306 AD2d 689, 690 [2003]). The waiver of appeal also encompasses defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance insofar as he does not allege that “the claimed ineffectiveness induced an otherwise knowing and voluntary guilty plea” (People v McGuffie, 294 AD2d 617, 618 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 699 [2002]; see People v Castano, supra at 687). As we fail to discern any nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on direct appeal, the judgments are affirmed and defense counsel’s application is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]).
Defendant’s remaining argument, raised in his CPL 440.20 motion, is that trial counsel was ineffective because counsel allegedly told him that the plea agreement included a promise that he would receive a sentence of 4x/2 to 9 years’ imprisonment. However, the record contradicts defendant’s claim, since defendant stated during the plea colloquy that no promises had been made by anyone with respect to the sentence (see People v Gene SS., 51 AD2d 1064, 1065 [1976]). In addition, defendant was told on several occasions that no promises as to sentencing were being made, and he indicated that he understood. As such, we perceive no error in County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.30 [4] [c], [d]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered May 12, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty in satisfaction of a two-count indictment to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. County Court thereafter sentenced him as a second felony offender to a prison term of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant initially contends that his attorney and County Court pressured him into pleading guilty, thereby rendering his plea involuntary. That claim, however, has not been preserved for our review in light of defendant’s failure to move for withdrawal of his plea or vacatur of the judgment of conviction (see People v Perez, 35 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2006]; People v Missimer, 32 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 927 [2006]). In that regard, while defendant apparently at one point asked his attorney to advise the court that he wished to withdraw his plea, the court specifically questioned him on the matter prior to sentencing and defendant clearly and unequivocally indicated that he did not want to withdraw his plea but, instead, wanted to go forward with sentencing. In any event, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is without merit and the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable here (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). Defendant’s allegation of coercion is belied by the transcript of the plea allocution, which demonstrates that his guilty plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.
Defendant also asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Although defendant has failed to preserve this matter for our review (see People v Henkel, 37 AD3d 873, 873 [2007]; People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]), we nevertheless note that, notwithstanding defendant’s unsubstantiated assertions, nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of his attorney and, further, defendant received a favorable plea (see People v Nugent, 31 AD3d 976, 977 [2006]; People v Rodriguez, 29 AD3d 1215, 1216 [2006]). Thus, were we to entertain defendant’s claim, we would conclude that he received meaningful representation.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Loyola, J.), rendered February 10, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted pursuant to a superior court information charging him with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. At a subsequent appearance before County Court (Drago, J.), and in full satisfaction of both the superior court information and other pending drug-related charges, defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to the charged crime. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court (Loyola, J.) thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to four years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues on appeal that County Court (Drago, J.) failed to adequately explore defendant’s stated mental health issues (depression, anxiety and a sleep disorder) and erred in accepting his plea without first conducting a competency hearing. Although defendant’s arguments on these points survive his uncontested waiver of the right to appeal, such claims are unpreserved for our review absent record evidence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Duffy, 126 AD3d 1142, 1142 [2015]; People v Borden, 91 AD3d 1124, 1125 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 862 [2012]; People v Stoddard, 67 AD3d 1055, 1055 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 806 [2010]). Were we to reach this issue, we would find it to be lacking in merit.
“[A] defendant is presumed competent and, absent reasonable grounds to believe that he or she is incapable of understanding the proceedings due to a mental disease or defect, a court is not required to order a competency hearing based solely upon a history of substance abuse or mental illness” (People v Duffy, 126 AD3d at 1142; see People v Bennett, 30 AD3d 631, 631 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 809 [2006]). Here, a review of the plea colloquy confirms that defendant responded appropriately to County Court’s inquiries, indicated that he understood the nature of the proceedings and assured the court that he wished to proceed (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]; People v Bennett, 30 AD3d at 631; People v Mears, 16 AD3d 917, 918 [2005]). The record similarly reflects that defendant “made no statements that called into question the voluntariness of his plea so as to alert the court of the need to inquire as to his competency or to hold a competency hearing” (People v Duffy, 126 AD3d at 1142; see People v Rought, 90 AD3d 1247, 1248 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 962 [2012]; People v Bennett, 30 AD3d at 631). Under these circumstances, we would not find that County Court erred in accepting defendant’s plea without first conducting a competency hearing (see People v Duffy, 126 AD3d at 1143; People v Mears, 16 AD3d at 918). To the extent that defendant’s related ineffective assistance of counsel claim implicates the voluntariness of his plea and, therefore, survives the appeal waiver, this issue is similarly unpreserved for our review (see People v Baxter, 154 AD3d 1010, 1011 [2017]; People v Williams, 150 AD3d 1549, 1551 [2017]; People v Borden, 91 AD3d at 1125-1126). Additionally, for the reasons previously discussed, were this issue properly before us, we would find it to be lacking in merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County rendered June 16, 1972, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the fourth degree and two counts of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree. The indictment arose out of two alleged sales of LSD by defendant to a State Police informer. The jury found defendant guilty of all four counts and the trial court sentenced him to a term of not more than four years imprisonment on each count, the terms to run concurrently. Defendant contends .(1) that he was denied a speedy trial; (2) that the lower court erred in refusing to admit the testimony of two defense witnesses; (3) that the sentence was harsh and excessive; and (4) that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. When the case came on for trial on January 13, 1972, the District Attorney moved for an adjournment on the ground that a preceding trial had lasted until approximately 1:30 a.m. of that morning and, as a result, he had been unable to have his witnesses ready for trial that day. The court adjourned the ease for a period of four days. We find that the defendant was not prejudiced by this short delay. Nor do we find merit in defendant’s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the testimony of two defense witnesses which he purportedly offered to show bias and hostility on the part of. the prosecution’s chief witness, the informant. The testimony offered, however, could not on any view be regarded as demonstrative of the witness’ bias towards defendant, but rather merely tended to show prior immoral or criminal acts of the witness. Unlike hostility or bias, which <(is not a collateral inquiry, but may be proved by others than the witness himself” (People V. Glermon, 175 N. Y. 45, 52), testimony as to prior immoral or criminal acts relates to collateral matter. Therefore, although the witness may be cross-examined, the cross-examiner may not (except as to a criminal conviction) call other witnesses or produce other evidence to refute him (People v. Zabrocky, 26 N Y 2d 530, 535; Richardson, Evidence [9th ed.], § 503). Thus, the proffered testimony was properly excluded. We find that the sentence imposed is not •excessive. Having been convicted of four felonies involving the sale and possession of drugs, including two class D felony counts, defendant could have received a far greater sentence. Thus, a maximum sentence of four years is by no means harsh or excessive. We find no merit in defendant’s final contention that the record is insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The verdict is amply supported by the record. We have examined the remainder of defendant’s contentions and find them to be without merit. Judgment affirmed. Staley, Jr., J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered March 12, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison sentence of six years and an unspecified period of postrelease supervision and waived his right to appeal. As part of the plea agreement, County Court expressly advised defendant that if he, among other things, failed to cooperate with the Probation Department or appear for sentencing, it could impose the maximum permissible sentence. Defendant indicated that he understood and signed a Parker admonishment to that effect (see People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141 [1982]). When defendant failed to report to the Saratoga County Department of Probation as directed, County Court issued a warrant for his arrest. Upon defendant’s return to custody, a hearing was held to determine whether defendant should receive an enhanced sentence. At the conclusion thereof, County Court found that defendant indeed violated the terms of his release and thereafter sentenced him to a term of nine years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.
We affirm. County Court clearly had the right to impose an enhanced sentence (see id.). Inasmuch as defendant failed to tender a valid excuse for failing to comply with the conditions of his release, the imposition of the enhanced sentence was justified (see People v Walker, 30 AD3d 823 [2006]; People v Marshall, 25 AD3d 876, 877 [2006], Iv denied 6 NY3d 850 [2006]). Defendant’s remaining contention, that the enhanced sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice, is not properly before us in light of his valid and unchallenged waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hopkins, 46 AD3d 1107, 1108 [2007]; People v Marshall, 25 AD3d at 877; People v Holmes, 306 AD2d 889 [2003], Iv denied 100 NY2d 621 [2003]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered July 7, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, who was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant’s plea was entered into with the express understanding that he was waiving his right to appeal and would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 61/2 to 13 years to run concurrently with a previously imposed sentence.
On appeal, defendant contends that this sentence is harsh and excessive and requests that this Court reduce it in the interest of justice. Defendant, however, has failed to preserve this claim for our review in light of the fact that he specifically waived his right to appeal the sentence as part of his guilty plea (see, People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673; People v Sullivan, 223 AD2d 893). Notably, defendant does not contend, nor would the record support a contention that his plea was entered into involuntarily. In any event, were we to consider the merits, we would find that the sentence is neither harsh nor excessive in view of defendant’s prior criminal history, which includes a drug-related conviction, and the fact that the sentence agreed upon relieved defendant of significant jail time exposure.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered September 18, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Pursuant to a plea agreement which included a waiver of the right to appeal, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. When defendant appeared for sentencing, County Court noted that the presen-tence report contained a statement attributed to defendant in which he asserted his innocence and claimed that he entered his plea in order to avoid a sentence of 25 years to life. The court adjourned the matter to permit defendant to consult with his attorney and, thereafter, defendant confirmed that the statements he made at the time of the plea, in which he admitted his guilt of the charged crime, were true and accurate. The court then imposed the agreed-upon indeterminate sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, that the statutory scheme pursuant to which he was sentenced is unconstitutional and that his plea was not voluntary. Inasmuch as “a defendant always retains the right to challenge the legality of the sentence or the voluntariness of the plea” (People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), the validity of defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal is irrelevant to this appeal (see, People v Falcis, 233 AD2d 340, Iv denied 89 NY2d 1011; People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, Iv denied 88 NY2d 982). With regard to defendant’s challenge to the legality of his sentence, the facts and circumstances of this case do not warrant the conclusion that defendant’s sentence violated the constitutional proscriptions of cruel and unusual punishment (see, People v Thompson, 83 NY2d 477). We note that defendant is a previously deported alien with a lengthy criminal history which includes drug-related crimes, and he admitted possessing two pounds of cocaine at the time of his arrest for the instant offense.
There is also no merit to defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea. During the plea proceeding, County Court advised defendant of his rights and the consequences of a guilty plea and conducted a thorough colloquy to determine that defendant, who was represented by counsel, was entering a knowing and voluntary plea and had, in fact, committed the crime charged in the indictment. Based upon defendant’s claim of innocence during an interview for the presentence report, the court adjourned the sentencing to provide defendant with an opportunity to confer with counsel to determine whether he wanted to withdraw the plea. When defendant appeared on the adjourned date, defense counsel advised the court that he had been given sufficient opportunity to consult with his client and that defendant wanted to proceed with sentencing based upon the plea. In response to the court’s inquiry, defendant assured the court that the statement in the presentence report was not accurate and that the statements he made at the time of the plea were true and accurate. Based upon County Court’s appropriate response to the limited area of uncertainty created by the presentence report, and considering the ample evidence that defendant’s plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered, the judgment must be affirmed (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 667-668; People v Murphy, 243 AD2d 954, lv denied 91 NY2d 835).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered March 12, 2003, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Waiving her right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with the understanding that the recommended sentence was 2 to 6 years in prison. Sentencing was deferred, however, to allow defendant to participate in a Drug Court program. After defendant twice failed to appear at Drug Court, she was sentenced to a prison term of V-k to 4V2 years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we note that, insofar as defendant waived her right to appeal and failed to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, her challenge to the voluntariness of her guilty plea is not preserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Lasher, 14 AD3d 943, 943-944 [2005]). As there is nothing in the record which casts significant doubt on her guilt, no exception to the preservation rule applies (see People v Rich, 10 AD3d 739, 740 [2004]; People v Keyes, 300 AD2d 909, 909-910 [2002]).
Defendant’s appellate counsel asserts that, since defendant was a crack cocaine user, she may have been too intoxicated to form the requisite intent to sell. Failure to advise defendant of this possible intoxication defense is thus the basis for both the claim that defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel and that her plea was not knowing and voluntary. Not only is this argument based on sheer speculation, it is belied by the record. In a thorough plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant, among other things, that by pleading guilty she waived any affirmative defenses and defendant clearly admitted—by repeating the question before answering it—that she possessed cocaine with the intent to sell it. In short, the record is devoid of evidence that defendant was intoxicated at the time that she committed the crime (see People v Lasher, supra at 944; People v Jaworski, 296 AD2d 597, 598 [2002]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered April 17, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The charge stemmed from a controlled buy that occurred in the City of Kingston, Ulster County on September 11, 2012, during the course of which defendant allegedly was found to be in possession of 110 glassine envelopes of a substance that field tested positive for heroin. When the parties appeared before County Court in February 2013 for a suppression hearing and jury selection, defense counsel indicated that, despite having rejected prior offers, defendant was interested in accepting a plea. Following an extensive colloquy with County Court, defendant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment and waived his right to appeal in exchange for a sentence of nine years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant’s subsequent pro se motion to withdraw his plea was denied, and County Court thereafter sentenced defendant in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals, contending that the waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
We affirm. “When an appeal waiver is challenged, the operative question is whether the trial court has confirmed on the record that the defendant understands the terms and conditions of his or her plea agreement” (People v Pope, 129 AD3d 1389, 1389 [2015] [citations omitted]). To that end, the court is “not obliged to engage in any particular litany or catechism in satisfying itself that a defendant has entered a knowing, intel ligent and voluntary appeal waiver” (People v Smith, 121 AD3d 1131, 1131 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1123 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). As long as the record reflects “that there was some judicial examination of the waiver itself” (People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and that the defendant had “a full appreciation of the consequences of such waiver” (People v Spellicy, 123 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 992 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]), the challenged waiver may be upheld.
Here, although County Court should have more clearly distinguished defendant’s right to appeal from the remainder of the rights that defendant forfeited upon pleading guilty, the record nonetheless reflects that County Court reviewed the waiver with defendant and obtained the required assurances that defendant fully appreciated the appellate rights that he was waiving (see People v Waite, 120 AD3d 1446, 1447 [2014]; People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1141 [2014]). Notably, during the course of the colloquy between County Court and defendant, defendant — evidencing his knowledge of the criminal justice system — inquired as to whether the waiver encompassed only those issues that could be raised upon a “direct appeal” or extended to CPL article 440 motions and habeas corpus proceedings as well. Following additional discussions with County Court, defendant indicated that he had no further questions and, when County Court urged defendant to pose any inquiries that he may have to counsel prior to proceeding, defendant replied, “I’m fine.” Defendant was presented with a copy of the detailed written waiver of appeal, which was amended to address defendant’s concern regarding his right to pursue certain postplea applications, and was questioned as to his understanding thereof. Again, defendant indicated that he understood everything that had been discussed. Defendant then executed the written waiver — the text of which expressly delineated the separate and distinct nature of defendant’s appellate rights and confirmed that defendant had been afforded “ample opportunity to discuss such rights and [the] waiver with [his] attorney and to address and ask questions of [County] Court regarding them.” Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the record reflects that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal his conviction and sentence was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 982-983 [2014]; People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v White, 96 AD3d 1299, 1299-1300 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1029 [2012]; compare People v Pope, 129 AD3d at 1389-1390; People v Ritter, 124 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2015]; People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]).
As to defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, certain of the arguments raised by defendant in this regard— including his assertion that defense counsel failed to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation (see People v Bahr, 96 AD3d 1165, 1166 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1024 [2012]), seek out and interview alibi witnesses (see People v Varmette, 70 AD3d 1167, 1172 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 845 [2010]), pursue certain discovery demands and/or available defenses (see People v Davis, 114 AD3d 1003, 1003 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 962 [2014]), seek sanctions for alleged prosecutorial misconduct (cf. People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]) and explain the collateral consequences of his plea (cf. People v Balbuena, 123 AD3d 1384, 1386 [2014])—involve matters outside of the record and, as such, are more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion. To the extent that the balance of defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts upon the voluntariness of his plea, such claim survives the valid appeal waiver but must be preserved by an appropriate postallocution motion (see e.g. People v Moses, 110 AD3d 1118, 1118 [2013]). In this regard, the record reflects that defendant made a pro se motion to withdraw his plea claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that counsel’s performance was deficient in that she conspired with the People to procure an “excessive sentence,” failed to adopt four of defendant’s five pro se motions and neglected to advocate for and secure a favorable plea deal. Accordingly, the additional grounds now advanced by defendant in his pro se brief— including his assertions that counsel failed to bring certain pretrial motions, neglected to correct inaccurate information relative to defendant’s criminal history and failed to object to County Court’s alleged bias — are unpreserved for our review, as defendant did not advance these specific grounds in his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Delarosa, 104 AD3d 956, 956 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1003 [2013]; People v Escalante, 16 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]).
In any event, “[d]efense counsel was not required to support defendant’s various pro se motions” (People v Blackwell, 129 AD3d 1690, 1691 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 926 [2015]; see People v Jones, 261 AD2d 920, 920 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 972 [1999]; see also People v Adams, 66 AD3d 1355, 1356 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]), and “the failure to make a particular pretrial motion does not — per se — constitute ineffective assistance of counsel” (People v Alnutt, 107 AD3d 1139, 1145 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014]; see People v Carbone, 101 AD3d 1232, 1235 [2012]). Additionally, counsel did endeavor to clarify and correct certain information contained in the presentence investigation report (see People v Orengo, 286 AD2d 344, 344-345 [2001], affd 97 NY2d 739 [2002]) and, contrary to defendant’s assertion, the record falls far short of establishing any colorable claim of judicial bias, thereby obviating any need for counsel to take corrective action in this regard. The record is similarly bereft of any evidence of a “conspiracy” to subject defendant to an “excessive” sentence. In short, inasmuch as defendant “receive [d] an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Vonneida, 130 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; accord People v Jenkins, 130 AD3d 1091, 1091 [2015]), we are satisfied that defendant was afforded meaningful representation.
Finally, defendant’s challenge to the perceived severity of his sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]), and his assertion that County Court should have assigned substitute counsel to represent him is unpreserved for our review. Defendant’s remaining arguments, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered August 20, 1998, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count superior court information with the understanding that she would receive a 3- to 9-year prison sentence. Following the plea, defendant was released on her own recognizance with the condition that if she failed to reappear on the sentencing date County Court was authorized to revoke its sentencing commitment and impose a sentence of 5 to 15 years in prison. Defendant failed to appear on January 9, 1998 for sentencing, was indicted on April 3, 1998 for bail jumping in the first degree, was arrested in the City of Middletown, Orange County, on or about June 10, 1998 and returned to Broome County. On August 20, 1998, County Court, denied her motion to withdraw her previous plea and imposed the enhanced sentence, whereupon the bail jumping charge was dismissed on the People’s motion. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Inasmuch as defendant violated the release conditions by failing to appear for sentencing despite being informed by County Court that such conduct would justify an enhanced sentence, we reject defendant’s contention that the 5- to 15-year sentence imposed was harsh and excessive under the circumstances (see, People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879; People v Hughes, 260 AD2d 657, lv denied 93 NY2d 972). Moreover, defendant’s specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is belied by the record which reveals that defense counsel filed a motion seeking to withdraw defendant’s guilty plea based upon the court’s stated intent to revoke the sentencing commitment and impose the enhanced sentence.

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Teresi, J.), rendered March 7, 2003 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of all charges pending against him, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was subsequently sentenced, as agreed, to a prison term of 37a to 7 years. Defendant now appeals, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
We affirm. Although defendant expressly waived his right to appeal, his challenge to the effectiveness of counsel implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea and, thus, survives such waiver. Defendant, however, did not preserve that issue, having failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]). In any event, his claim is without merit. “In the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995] [citations omitted]; see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Here, counsel negotiated a favorable plea agreement exposing defendant to far less prison time than if he were convicted of the pending charges after trial and there is no indication in the record that counsel was otherwise ineffective (see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Washington, supra at 742). Finally, due to defendant’s knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review his contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Allen, supra at 690; People v Travis, 12 AD3d 784 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered March 14, 2001, (1) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (four counts), and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and four counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 5 to 10 years on the felony convictions and one-year jail terms on the misdemeanor convictions. In connection therewith, defendant also admitted to violating the terms of his probation and, as a result, his probation was revoked and a consecutive sentence of 1 to 3 years was imposed. Defendant appeals.
Defendant has failed to preserve for our review his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea inasmuch as he failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Harris, 293 AD2d 818, lv denied 98 NY2d 676; People v Fuller, 245 AD2d 987, lv denied 91 NY2d 941). Were we to consider the merits, we would find that County Court did not induce or coerce defendant to enter a plea by informing him of the potential sentence to which he was exposed (see People v Lambe, 282 AD2d 776). In addition, the record establishes that his plea was knowingly and voluntarily made (see id.). Furthermore, we find no abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences imposed (see People v Van Hoesen, 213 AD2d 944, lvs denied 85 NY2d 980, 981). Contrary to defendant’s contention, the record reveals that County Court appropriately considered all relevant factors.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered June 5, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court denied defendant’s subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, to a prison term of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that County Court abused its discretion in summarily denying his motion to withdraw his plea. It is within the trial court’s discretion to determine the nature and extent of the fact-finding procedures necessary to decide a motion to withdraw a guilty plea and a limited interrogation by the court will often be sufficient (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 544 [1993]; People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927 [1974]; People v Riddick, 136 AD3d 1124, 1124 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1154 [2016]). “An evidentiary hearing will be required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to the plea’s voluntariness” (People v Decker, 139 AD3d 1113, 1116 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 928 [2016]; see People v Brown, 14 NY3d 113, 116 [2010]).
Here, defendant moved to withdraw his plea on the basis that he continued to be harassed and threatened by a code-fendant, that he was innocent and that his guilty plea would result in his deportation. A review of the plea colloquy reflects that County Court explained, and defendant acknowledged that he understood, the deportation consequences of the guilty plea (see People v Rebelo, 137 AD3d 1315, 1317 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). Additionally, the continued threats and harassment by a codefendant do not undermine the voluntariness of the plea. Finally, defendant’s sworn admissions during the plea allocution contradict his conclusory and unsupported claim of innocence (see People v Crispell, 136 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1149 [2016]; People v Barton, 126 AD3d 1238, 1239 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1142 [2016]).
Next, we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid because he was not advised that his right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights that he automatically forfeited by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Beverly, 137 AD3d 1421, 1422 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1128 [2016]). As such, his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive is not precluded. Nevertheless, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed. We note that the agreed-upon sentence was significantly less than the maximum statutorily permitted sentence (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [i]). Furthermore, our review of the record reveals no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion to warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v White, 122 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2014]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered April 29, 1998, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 3V2 to 7 years in prison. Defendant now appeals, arguing that he should have been sentenced to parole supervision at a drug treatment campus pursuant to CPL 410.91. We disagree. During the plea colloquy, defendant was informed that there was no promise with respect to his eligibility for the drug treatment program by either County Court or the People, nor was it a condition to the plea agreement. Moreover, although at the time of the plea the People took no position regarding a sentence of parole supervision, the People nevertheless expressed their opposition thereto at the time of sentencing. County Court was therefore unable to impose such a sentence (see, CPL 410.91 [4]). Furthermore, we reject defendant’s assertion that the agreed-upon sentence was harsh or excessive (see, People v Black, 253 AD2d 984, 985, lv denied 92 NY2d 980). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.

"Garry, J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), rendered July 1, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered November 24, 2014, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
In April 2013, in the course of a traffic stop in the Town of Harpersfield, Delaware County, defendant was arrested after drugs were found on his person and also in the vehicle in which he was a passenger. A preplea probation report was prepared, and thereafter, in July 2013, defendant executed a waiver of indictment and consented to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with various counts arising from the incident. On the same date, in full satisfaction of the charges, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and executed an appeal waiver. He was sentenced in accord with his plea agreement to a split sentence of 90 days of incarceration and five years of probation. Defendant’s subsequent motion to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the denial of his CPL 440.10 motion.
Defendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as he was erroneously advised that he was eligible for a youthful offender adjudication and as counsel failed to adequately advise him of the deportation consequences of his plea. At the outset, these claims survive defendant’s uncontested appeal waiver only to the extent that they impact the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Livziey, 117 AD3d 1341, 1342 [2014]; People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013]; People v Leonard, 63 AD3d 1278, 1278 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 797 [2009]). Further, although a defendant is ordinarily required to preserve such a claim through an appropriate postallocution motion, preservation is not required where, as here, there is no practical opportunity to do so prior to sentencing (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 183 [2013]; People v Williams, 123 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2014]).
Defendant was ineligible for youthful offender treatment at the time of the underlying proceedings due to a prior youthful offender adjudication (see CPL 720.10 [2] [c]). As he now contends, it appears from the record that both defense counsel and County Court mistakenly believed that he remained eligible. However, the court clearly and repeatedly advised that he would not be granted a youthful offender adjudication; the court expressly stated this three times prior to the plea allocution. Nonetheless, defendant chose to proceed. In these circumstances, the misapprehension as to defendant’s eligibility was rendered irrevelant by the court’s clear and repeated warnings. Accordingly, we find that defendant’s plea was voluntary (see generally People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 383 [2015]; People v Chaney, 72 AD3d 1194, 1196 [2010]).
Defendant’s claim that he was not warned that he would be deported as a consequence of the plea is also belied by the record. Both prior to and during the course of the plea allocution, and again before pronouncing sentence, County Court expressly advised defendant that a potential consequence of his plea would be his removal from the country; this was described in the initial proceedings as a “likely result.” Thus, defendant was adequately apprised of the potential consequence of deportation that he faced as a result of his plea (see People v Castro, 133 AD3d 986, 987 [2015]; People v Achouatte, 91 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 954 [2012], cert denied 568 US —, 133 S Ct 216 [2012]).
Finally, we find that defendant’s claims are capable of being resolved by reference to the record on direct appeal and, thus, County Court did not err in denying defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing (see People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796, 799 [1985]; People v LaPierre, 108 AD3d 945, 946 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J), rendered December 7, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant waived indictment by a grand jury and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty with the understanding that the recommended sentence would be capped at 2 to 6 years in prison. Sentencing was deferred, however, to allow defendant to participate in a Drug Court program. After defendant twice absconded from Drug Court, he was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. Defendant now appeals.
Insofar as defendant waived his right to appeal and failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim that his guilty plea was not voluntarily made is not preserved for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075,1075 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 923 [2007]). Furthermore, as there is nothing in the record which casts significant doubt on his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea, no exception to the preservation rule applies (see People v Wagoner, 30 AD3d 629, 629 [2006]; People v Van Bramer, 26 AD3d 672, 673 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]). In any event, defendant’s contention, that he entered his plea without full knowledge of its consequences and was unaware that violating the Drug Court program would lead to a prison sentence, is belied by the fact that County Court fully advised him of the rights he was relinquishing as a result of his plea and ascertained that he understood those rights and that the Drug Court participation agreement he signed at allocution clearly outlined the ramifications of failing to complete the program. Therefore, we are satisfied that defendant’s plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made (see People v Escalante, 16 AD3d 984, 985 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]; People v Burdo, 1 AD3d 793, 794 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]).
Similarly, defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment rendered his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as it relates to the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea unpreserved for review (see People v Baldwin, 36 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2007]; People v Fogarty, 35 AD3d 957, 958 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 922 [2007]). Inasmuch as defendant’s arguments focus on counsel’s alleged failure to investigate the circumstances of his case, which lies outside the record, defendant’s claims are more properly suited to a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Douglas, 38 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 843 [2007]). Finally, defendant’s challenge to his sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Sawyer, 41 AD3d 1089,1090 [2007]; People v Smith, 37 AD3d 975, 976 [2007]).

Defendant was charged in two separate indictments with the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree after selling cocaine to an undercover police officer in April and June 2006. Following consolidation of the indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges. Consistent with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3V2 years, with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Folk, 43 AD3d 1229, 1230 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1033 [2008]; People v Brill, 42 AD3d 823, 823 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 960 [2007]). In any event, even assuming that defendant’s contention that County Court misrepresented the maximum sentence defendant was facing under the indictments at his arraignment is correct, inaccurate information concerning sentence exposure is not dispositive of whether a plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered (see People v Garcia, 92 NY2d 869, 870 [1998]). Furthermore, as our review of the record reveals no evidence that defendant relied on this information in entering his plea, we are convinced that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea (see People v Wilkinson, 151 AD2d 801, 802 [1989], lv denied 74 NY2d 821 [1989]). Finally, as both indictments are for offenses defined by the same statutory provision, we find that County Court acted within its discretion in consolidating the indictments pursuant to the People’s application (see CPL 200.20 [2] [c]; [4]; People v Ferrer, 17 AD3d 777, 777 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 788 [2005]).

Ap peal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered August 10, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In April 2001, defendant was indicted on two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. The charges arose out of defendant’s sale of cocaine to a confidential police informant. Represented by counsel, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all six counts of the indictment and waived her right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 2Vs to 7 years. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the plea allocution, contending that County Court failed to elicit an adequate factual recitation from her before accepting her plea. Initially, we note that while defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal does not preclude this Court’s review of the voluntariness of her plea, defendant’s “failure to move either to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction generally precludes review of [her] challenge to the factual sufficiency of the plea allocution” (People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635; see, People v Ward, 282 AD2d 871, 872). Defendant made no statements during the colloquy which were inconsistent with her guilt, which negated an essential element of the crime or called into question the voluntariness of her plea and, thus, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable in this case (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, supra at 636; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s challenges to the adequacy of the allocution or the voluntariness of her plea, we would find they are without merit. A review of the colloquy between County Court and defendant demonstrates that both the plea and the waiver of appeal were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Martinez, 243 AD2d 923, 924; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769-770, lv denied 89 NY2d 919). At the plea colloquy, the court fully informed defendant of her rights and the ramifications of pleading guilty. Defendant stated that she understood the consequences of her plea and waiver and that she was not under the influence of drugs or medication. Defendant then admitted that she had knowingly and unlawfully attempted to sell cocaine on the date charged. Given these facts, we find no basis to vacate the guilty plea.
Likewise, in light of defendant’s knowing waiver of the right to appeal the sentence as part of her guilty plea, her challenge to the severity of the sentence is not preserved for our review (see, People v Charles, 258 AD2d 740, lv denied 93 NY2d 968; People v McElhiney, 237 AD2d 827, 828, lv denied 90 NY2d 861). In any event, we are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, given defendant’s prior criminal record, the nature of defendant’s crime, that she received the negotiated sentence as part of a favorable plea bargain and that there are no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see, People v Mickens, 275 AD2d 818, 819; People v Chapman, 273 AD2d 495, lv denied 95 NY2d 904).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered May 23, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In September 2007, defendant allegedly sold cocaine to an undercover police officer and was thereafter arrested and indicted for one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and six counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in varying degrees. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and executed a written waiver of appeal. Prior to sentencing, defendant submitted a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting that such plea was involuntary and that his counsel was ineffective. County Court denied his motion and—pursuant to the negotiated plea agreement— sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of seven years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. On this appeal, defendant maintains that County Court abused its discretion in denying his motion without a hearing because his plea was involuntary and that, among other things, he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender.
We note, initially, that defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Walker, 47 AD3d 965, 966 [2008]). Nonetheless, we now affirm. “The decision to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea is a matter within the trial court’s sound discretion, and a hearing is required only where the record presents a genuine question of fact as to its voluntariness” (People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d 664, 664 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 557 [2002] [citation omitted]). Moreover, in the absence of some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn (see People v Atkinson, 58 AD3d 943, 943 [2009]).
Here, the record amply supports County Court’s determination that defendant entered into a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea. Indeed, during his plea colloquy, defendant admitted to facts establishing the elements of his crime and acknowledged that he understood the nature and consequences associated with his guilty plea (see People v White, 52 AD3d 950, 951 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 742 [2008]). Defendant’s subsequent protestation of innocence, furthermore, is insufficient to warrant a hearing on the issue inasmuch as it is unsupported by any evidence and is contradicted by grand jury testimony from both the arresting police officer, who indicated that defendant was in possession of $1,400 worth of cocaine at the time of his apprehension, and the undercover police officer, who stated that she purchased 1.9 grams of cocaine from defendant (see People v De Fabritis, 296 AD2d at 665; People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940-941 [1998]).
Defendant’s assertion that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender implicates the legality of the sentence imposed and is, thus, similarly not precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Ellis, 53 AD3d 776, 777 [2008]). Nevertheless, his failure to raise the issue before County Court renders the claim unpreserved for our review (see People v Atkinson, 58 AD3d at 944). Were we to consider it, we would find it to be without merit as the record demonstrates substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Paige, 24 AD3d 895, 895 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 851 [2006]). Defendant’s remaining contentions have been reviewed and are without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered April 3, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 3V2 years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Notwithstanding defendant’s assertion otherwise, his factual recitation during the plea allocution did not cast doubt on his guilt, negate an essential element of the crime or call into question the voluntariness of his plea. On the contrary, although the police discovered crack cocaine in the backyard of defendant’s neighbor, defendant informed County Court that they were his drugs, he had hidden the drugs there and he intended to sell them. He likewise acknowledged his understanding of the ramifications of pleading guilty, stated that he had all the time he needed to discuss the matter with his attorney and that he was entering the guilty plea freely and voluntarily. Accordingly, we find that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea (see People v First, 62 AD3d 1043, 1044 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 915 [2009]; People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]) and that his description of the underlying facts was sufficient to establish the elements of the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see Penal Law § 220.16 [1]).
Defendant next contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to make certain pretrial motions. However, “[t]he fact that defense counsel did not request a particular pretrial hearing does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance of counsel” (People v Jackson, 67 AD3d 1067, 1068 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 801 [2010]). Moreover, counsel negotiated a favorable plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on his effectiveness (see People v Singletary, 51 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 741 [2008]; People v Lee, 51 AD3d 1217, 1217-1218 [2008]).
Defendant’s remaining argument, to the extent that it is properly before us, is unpersuasive.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), entered June 26, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 4V2 to 13V2 years after pleading guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in fall satisfaction of a four-count indictment. He contends on this appeal that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive in view of his youth (22 years of age at the time of sentencing) and his lack of a prior criminal record. We disagree. A sentence that falls within the permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, 595, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872). No extraordinary circumstances have been shown to exist here nor can we discern any abuse of judicial discretion in light of the fact that a sentence of SVs to 25 years (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) could have been imposed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered August 7, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was charged with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and third degrees, having been arrested while in possession of 694 vials and nine plastic bags of cocaine. Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in exchange for an agreed-upon prison sentence of five years to life.
Defendant appeals, contending that this sentence is harsh and excessive given his previously clean criminal record. Our review, however, reveals that defendant admitted to both possession of the drugs and knowledge of their weight. Further, his sentence was imposed pursuant to the terms of a plea bargain agreement and is within the statutory guidelines. The sentence does not constitute an abuse of County Court’s discretion and it will not, accordingly, be disturbed (see, People v Hunter, 217 AD2d 723, lv denied 86 NY2d 843).

"Mercure, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered December 19, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant entered a plea of guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in a superior court information and waived his right to appeal. County Court informed defendant that he would be sentenced to 2 to 6 years in prison and released defendant on his own recognizance, indicating that defendant’s failure to appear for sentencing would constitute a violation of the plea agreement and authorize the court to impose a harsher prison sentence of up to 15 years. Defendant did not appear for sentencing on the appointed date and County Court ultimately sentenced him in absentia to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we note that defendant has failed to preserve by appropriate motion his contention that the waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary (see People v Kirkland, 2 AD3d 1063, 1063 [2003]; People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 685 [2003]). In any event, were we to consider defendant’s claims, we would conclude that the waiver was entirely proper. County Court extensively questioned defendant regarding his willingness to enter into the plea agreement and understanding of the consequences, including the relinquishment of his right to pursue an appeal. Defendant’s answers to every question posed by the court were unequivocal, giving no indication that he did not comprehend the terms of the waiver or any other aspect of the plea agreement. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the plea and waiver were knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Barrett, 301 AD2d 790, 790-791 [2003]; People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513 [1998]). Contrary to defendant’s assertions, the court was not required to engage in any specific litany during the allocution (see People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 910-911 [1990]); nor did the fact that the waiver was unwritten render the plea deficient (see People v Willis, 2 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2003]).
We further reject defendant’s contention that County Court impermissibly enhanced his sentence after he failed to appear for sentencing. Following its acceptance of defendant’s plea, County Court issued a Parker admonishment expressly inform - ing defendant that his failure to appear for sentencing would amount to a breach of the plea agreement, releasing the court from its promise of a lighter sentence (see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Parker, 57 NY2d 136, 141-142 [1982]; People v Waldron, 257 AD2d 771 [1999]). Further, County Court adjourned the proceedings twice in an effort to locate defendant and ascertain the reason for his absence. In our view, County Court did not err in imposing the enhanced sentence in defendant’s absence (see People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713, 714 [2000]; People v Sumner, 254 AD2d 537, 537-538 [1998]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County, rendered August 13, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and one count of possession of weapons, dangerous instruments and appliances. Following a jury trial, defendant George A. Skokan, Jr., was convicted of the possession of cocaine and marijuana as well as brass knuckles. Thereafter, he was sentenced to a term of not less than five years nor more than 15 years on the cocaine conviction and to a concurrent term not exceeding five years on the marijuana conviction. For possession of the brass knuckles he received a one-year term in the county jail. On this appeal, defendant raises two questions relating to the admission of certain testimony into evidence and the issuance of a search warrant, which were previously considered by this court in an appeal by his wife who was a codefendant, and we see no reason for further discussion or disturbance of our earlier resolution of those issues (People v Skokan, 50 AD2d 615). His only remaining contention is that the sentence which he received is excessive, but we must disagree as the sentencing court has broad discretion in this area and no extraordinary circumstances are presented justifying our interference therewith (People v Dittmar, 41 AD2d 788; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861). Although the sentence imposed for the possession of cocaine, a class C felony, was the maximum permissible (Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 2, par [c]), the court adequately explained its action and its reasons for imposing a minimum term as well (Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 3, par [b]) and in view of the serious nature of the crime and defendant’s admitted prior involvement in drug traffic there was no abuse of discretion. Likewise, the other sentences are clearly within the statutory limits and should not be disturbed. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P.

"Lahtinen, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered July 24, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
After an alleged sale of cocaine and heroin to an undercover police officer, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court denied his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment in which he contended that the grand jury proceedings had been defective. The case proceeded to trial and, while the juiy was deliberating following the presentation of proof, defendant elected to accept a plea offer by the People. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of all charges, he waived his right to appeal and he received a sentence, as a second felony offender, of two years in prison followed by 18 months of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant argues that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel, evidentiary errors occurred at trial, and the integrity of the grand jury was compromised by the presence of a law enforcement officer as . a grand juror. A guilty plea generally “marks the end of a criminal case, not a gateway to further litigation” (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5 [1985]). Thus, alleged errors that are normally forfeited by a guilty plea include, as relevant here, an assertion of ineffective assistance that is not directly related to the plea bargaining process or the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Parilla, 8 NY3d 654, 660 [2007]; People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535 [1982]; People v Heier, 73 AD3d 1392, 1393 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 805 [2010]), an argument regarding evidentiary rulings at trial (see People v Campbell, 73 NY2d 481, 486 [1989]; People v Mead, 198 AD2d 612, 613 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 899 [1993]), and a challenge to the grand jury proceedings that does not go to the issue of jurisdiction (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 231 [2000]; People v Robertson, 279 AD2d 711, 712-713 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 805 [2001]). We further note that, contrary to defendant’s contention, the record reveals that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d 987, 987 [2010]; People v Cruz, 74 AD3d 1496, 1497 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 803 [2010]), and accordingly his current arguments are also precluded by that valid waiver (see People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]).

Defendant entered counseled guilty pleas to each count of an indictment in full satisfaction of that indictment and a number of unspecified additional uncharged crimes with the express understanding that he would be sentenced as a predicate felony offender to a prison term of 3lh to 7 years. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals, challenging County Court’s determination of his suppression and Sandoval motions.
We affirm. As a preliminary matter, we note that a plea of guilty works a forfeiture of nonjurisdictional defects (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1), including adverse rulings on a Sandoval application (see, People v Otero, 184 AD2d 484, lv denied 80 NY2d 976; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 259-260, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026; People v Crouch, 161 AD2d 834). Therefore, by pleading guilty, defendant has removed from the case any appealable issue concerning the propriety of County Court’s Sandoval ruling (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 7).
Turning now to the suppression issue, which has been preserved for our consideration by express statutory provision (CPL 710.70 [2]), we conclude that County Court did not err in its determination. The record of the suppression hearing provides ample support for County Court’s conclusion that the challenged statement, made in Hudson City Court at the time of defendant’s arraignment on the felony complaint, was not the product of any questioning but, rather, was spontaneously volunteered after defendant had been fully apprised of his rights (see, e.g., People v Rivers, 56 NY2d 476; People v Wimberly, 145 AD2d 823, 824-825, lv denied 73 NY2d 1024).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered September 10, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and to waive his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2xh to 5 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, County Court received a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 indicating that defendant had been previously convicted of a felony on February 20, 1997. Based upon this statement, the court sentenced him as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that he was illegally sentenced as a second felony offender because County Court did not comply with the requirements of CPL 400.21. Preliminarily, we note that inasmuch as this claim implicates the legality of the sentence, defendant is not precluded from raising it by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Turner, 26 AD3d 524, 525 [2006]; People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Turning to the merits, defendant argues that County Court did not inquire if he wished to controvert the allegations contained in the second felony offender statement as required by CPL 400.21 (3). He makes no argument, however, challenging the validity of the prior conviction. A review of the sentencing transcript discloses that County Court read the statement and then asked defense counsel if his client acknowledged the prior conviction. Defendant responded that he did. Given defendant’s admission that he was the person convicted of the prior felony and the fact that he was given sufficient notice of and an opportunity to controvert the allegations made in the second felony offender statement, we find that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 and that County Court’s failure to specifically ask defendant if he wished to controvert the allegations of the statement was a harmless oversight (see People v Booker, 280 AD2d 785, 786 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 916 [2001]; People v Mann, 258 AD2d 738, 739 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 900 [1999]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered October 6, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a 10-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, he was sentenced on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as a persistent violent felony offender to the minimum permissible prison term of 12 years to life. On the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, he was sentenced to a prison term of 12 years, plus three years of postrelease supervision. County Court directed that the sentences were to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]). Based upon our review of the record, we agree. If defendant—who entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea—had been sentenced on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree alone, a challenge to the severity of that sentence would not be wholly frivolous because he received more than the minimum with respect to that charge and did not waive his right to appeal (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d at 635-636; cf.

Here, however, such a challenge would be futile because defendant will be imprisoned for at least 12 years on the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law § 70.08 [2], [3] [c]), followed by parole supervision for the rest of his life (see Executive Law § 259-i [2] [b]). Thus, were his concurrent sentence to be reduced, he would spend no less time in prison or under postrelease supervision (see People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 554 n 1 [2006]). Accordingly, appellate counsel’s application to be relieved of his assignment is granted and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Meyer, J.), rendered October 16, 2014, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) after he sold crack cocaine to a confidential informant on two occasions. After he rejected a plea offer and proceeded to a jury trial, he was found guilty as charged. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of 12 years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s sole argument on appeal—that the imposed sentence was in retaliation for exercising his constitutional right to a jury trial—may well be unpreserved for our review given the arguable failure of defendant or his counsel to raise the issue at sentencing (see People v Hurley, 75 NY2d 887, 888 [1990]; People v Haskins, 121 AD3d 1181, 1185 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1120 [2015]; People v Gallup, 302 AD2d 681, 686 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 594 [2003]). In any event, the fact that the imposed sentence was longer than the one offered defendant during the plea negotiations “ 4s not proof that defendant was penalized for exercising his right to a jury trial’ ” (People v Young, 86 AD3d 796, 800 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 905 [2011], quoting People v Robinson, 72 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]; see People v McCray, 96 AD3d 1160, 1161 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1104 [2012]). While defendant was considering a plea offer tendered by the People, County Court advised defendant of his potential sentencing exposure should he be convicted as charged following a jury trial. The court further stressed that it had no interest in penalizing defendant for proceeding to trial, but advised him that the light sentence offer reflected his willingness to enter a guilty plea to a reduced charge that would have protected a confidential informant whose identity had not yet been disclosed. Defendant nevertheless rebuffed that and all other efforts to resolve the charges and proceeded to a trial where the informant testified, and the extent of defendant’s involvement in the drug trade was made apparent. “[T]he quid pro quo of the bargaining process will almost necessarily involve offers to moderate sentences that ordinarily would be greater,” and the record before us reveals no evidence of retaliation or vindictiveness on the part of County Court stemming from defendant’s refusal to accept a plea bargain (People v Pena, 50 NY2d 400, 412 [1980], cert denied 449 US 1087 [1981]; see People v Martinez, 26 NY3d 196, 200 [2015]; People v Molina, 73 AD3d 1292, 1293 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 807 [2010]; People v Pepper, 89 AD2d 714, 718 [1982], affd 59 NY2d 353 [1983]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered April 30, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following his arrest on charges of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a waiver of appeal. Pursuant to this plea agreement, defendant agreed to cooperate with the District Attorney’s office and law enforcement officials investigating other individuals suspected of drug-related activities. In exchange for his release from jail and his satisfactory cooperation, defendant’s conviction would be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree for which he would be sentenced to a minimum prison term of 2 to 4 years and a maximum term of SVa to 7 years. Defendant entered into this cooperation agreement with the knowledge that if he failed to comply with its terms, his conviction would not be reduced and he would be sentenced as a second felony offender to a minimum prison term of 4V2 to 9 years and a maximum term of 12V2 to 25 years.
Following defendant’s release from jail, he fled the jurisdiction prior to providing any of the agreed-upon assistance. Approximately eight months later, he turned himself over to authorities and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of I2V2 to 25 years. Defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded from review by his knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 702 [2002]). Even if we were to reach the merits, considering defendant’s extensive criminal history, we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion that would warrant a reduction in the interest of justice (see People v Jones, 289 AD2d 871 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Ny dam, J.), rendered December 19, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
The sole issue raised on this appeal is whether County Court abused its discretion by denying defendant’s request for youthful offender status and by sentencing him as an adult to a period of incarceration of 1½ to 4½ years. The granting of youthful offender treatment rests entirely with the court’s discretion and depends upon the facts of each individual case (CPL 720.20 [1]; see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 333-335, affd 67 NY2d 625; see also, People v Hayes, 115 AD2d 910). Our review of the record discloses no abuse of judicial discretion here.
Defendant’s conviction arose out of his sale of heroin to a college student who subsequently died of a drug overdose. Although defendant, who was then 17 years old, had no prior criminal convictions, he was a known drug dealer in the community. As the sentencing court accurately observed, defendant’s sale of drugs on the date in question was not ""an impulsive, youthful indiscretion”, but a ""deliberate plan” to obtain cash illegally.
Additional factors supportive of County Court’s denial of youthful offender treatment are the recommendation in defendant’s presentence report that he merited ""no leniency” together with the fact that defendant has expressed little understanding or remorse for the consequences of his crime (see, People v Duff, 216 AD2d 689, 690).
Under the circumstances presented here, we find no abuse of County Court’s discretion in refusing defendant youthful offender status and no reason to consider youthful offender treatment in the interest of justice (see, People v Buckley, 196 AD2d 915; People v Pearson, 133 AD2d 951).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered April 7, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (nine counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts).
Defendant challenges the severity of the sentence, which includes nine consecutive indeterminate prison terms of 3 years to life imposed upon his plea of guilty of nine counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, with an aggregate term of 27 years to life. Criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree is a serious crime that has a significant adverse impact upon the community, and defendant admitted during the presentence investigation that he was involved as an intermediary between street level dealers and large suppliers in an ongoing family cocaine trafficking enterprise. Accordingly, a lengthy period of incarceration was warranted, as was a harsher sentence than those imposed upon the two codefendants who acted as defendant’s couriers.
Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of our authority to modify the sentence in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]). First, we note that County Court, in imposing this extremely severe sentence, relied, in large part, upon the conclusion that there was no likelihood that defendant could be rehabilitated. We find absolutely no record evidence to support such a conclusion. Accordingly, considering defendant’s age, the absence of any prior convictions involving the sale or possession of drugs or any prior felony convictions, the absence of violence and defendant’s acknowledgment of responsibility for his criminal conduct, we are persuaded that the sentence should be modified by reducing the aggregate indeterminate prison term to 15 years to life (see, People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908; People v Davis, 267 AD2d 597, 598-599; People v Sturgis, 202 AD2d 808, 810, lv denied 84 NY2d 833).
Peters, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the prison sentences imposed upon defendant’s conviction under counts 11, 13, 15 and 17 be served concurrently with each other and with the remaining sentences, and, as so modified, affirmed.

We reject defendant’s assertion that the prison sentence he received of 4 to 8 years as a second felony offender was harsh and excessive. The sentence was in accord with the plea bargain agreement and was well within the statutory limits (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Duskas, J.), rendered September 5, 1980, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. The defendant raises on this appeal the issue of the deprivation of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. The record discloses that defendant had been originally indicted on three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance, each of which was a class D felony punishable by an indeterminate term of seven years. His defense counsel was able, through plea negotiations, to substantially limit defendant’s exposure to imprisonment by a negotiated plea to a lesser crime in full satisfaction of all counts. The mere fact that counsel did not engage in some pretrial procedures available to defendant, in itself, does not indicate ineffective assistance of counsel. The strength of the People’s case may very well have made such efforts futile. The defendant has not successfully demonstrated inadequacy of his counsel or that counsel’s handling of the case was detrimental to defendant. The unsupported conclusory assertions of defendant to the contrary are ineffective to support his contention. The record on the other hand, indicates that defense counsel’s handling of the predicate felony hearing was that of a knowledgeable and capable advocate. Accordingly, we find no merit to defendant’s contention. Defendant next contends that his prior felony conviction was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and, therefore, should not have been the predicate for his sentence as a second felony offender. The burden of proving this contention reposes on defendant. The record is woefully devoid of credible evidence to establish the contention raised. Finally, defendant raises the question of the appropriateness of the sentence as a second felony offender. The court was required by law to impose a minimum sentence. The maximum imposed was lenient in view of the transgression. We find nothing in the sentence as would indicate that it is harsh or invalid. Judgment affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 8, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant, a native of Laos who speaks English with some difficulty, was indicted and charged with one count each of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first, second and third degrees for events occurring on three different dates. Initially, County Court refused to accept the negotiated plea agreement because of defendant’s indication that he had never transferred cocaine to undercover police officers. Four days later, the court accepted defendant’s plea of guilty which included a waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1).
Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is unpreserved for review since he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Rafter, 234 AD2d 711). Furthermore, contrary to defendant’s assertion on appeal, the case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation rule since, subsequent to defendant’s statement casting doubt upon his guilt, County Court appropriately conducted a detailed inquiry to ensure that defendant had committed the crime to which he was pleading guilty and that his plea was knowing and voluntary (see, People v Lopez, supra, at 666; People v Dobbins, 220 AD2d 234, lv denied 87 NY2d 921; see also, People v Woodberry, 216 AD2d 597, 598, lv denied 86 NY2d 805).
Specifically, an examination of the record reveals that, prior to accepting the plea, County Court not only required defendant to recite, in English, the events of the crime to which he was pleading, but also required defendant to tell the same information to his interpreter, in Laotian, which the interpreter then translated. During the colloquy, the court also repeatedly inquired, of defendant directly and through his interpreter, whether defendant understood what he was admitting and what rights he was forsaking by entering a plea of guilty; this included a review of the possible defense of entrapment. Rather than creating confusion, as defendant asserts, County Court’s inquiries in dual languages are indicative of the detailed manner in which the plea allocution was conducted (see, People v Sosa, 226 AD2d 921; People v Mohammed, 208 AD2d 1118, 1119, lv denied 85 NY2d 941).

"— Harris, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Lomanto, J.), rendered July 24, 1984, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
The issue on appeal is whether defendant’s plea of guilty should be set aside on the ground that it was not voluntarily and intelligently entered into by him. Defendant asserts that the terms of the plea bargain were not made clear to him and that he was under duress at the time he pleaded guilty. Defendant’s plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree was made in full satisfaction of the numerous charges pending against him.
It is well established that a defendant must have knowledge and understanding of the consequences of his plea and that a plea may be vacated if it was coerced or the defendant’s knowledge of the consequences was not adequately explored (Matter of Chaipis v State Liq. Auth., 44 NY2d 57, 63-64; see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17). Defendant asserts that at the time he agreed to the plea arrangement it was not clear whether the charges pending against him in Schenectady County were covered by the plea. However, in response to defendant’s inquiry about the Schenectady County charges, County Court clarified any doubts by unequivocally responding ""yes> they are dropped”. Further, defendant has not alleged that he has been prosecuted on those charges and, thus, even assuming there was an ambiguity, defendant has not shown that he was prejudiced by it.
Defendant’s argument that he was coerced to accept the plea is apparently based on his contention that County Court set his bail excessively high which prevented him from visiting his terminally ill mother. This argument is belied by the fact that the record is devoid of any evidence indicating that the court was aware of the condition of defendant’s mother prior to the time defendant accepted the plea agreement. Indeed, there is every indication that defendant had made tentative arrangements to meet bail by the time his plea was entered. He could have thus refrained from entering his guilty plea and proceeded with a bail application. Upon review of the record, and particularly the plea colloquy, it is evident that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement (see, People v Price, 105 AD2d 557, 559).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered December 9, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in exchange for an agreed-upon prison sentence of five years followed by three years of post-release supervision. At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea. Based upon some confusion as to whether the prosecutor had mentioned at the plea hearing the potential for persistent felony offender sentencing — which was not applicable in this case — and whether that statement may have improperly induced defendant’s plea, County Court offered defendant a reduced sentence if he waived the right to appeal that issue. When defendant attempted to bargain for an even lower sentence, the court stated, “If [defendant] wants to withdraw his plea today, that’s fine, it goes back on the trial calendar. We are through negotiating. It’s the original offer or nothing.” Defense counsel then informed the court that defendant would proceed with the five-year sentence. Counsel acknowledged defendant’s status as a second felony offender and the court sentenced him to five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends that County Court should have permitted him to withdraw his plea. The court did permit him to do so, but defendant instead chose to adhere to the original offer. Thus, he cannot now complain of the court’s actions in that regard. Having abandoned his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant did not preserve the argument that his plea was involuntary (see People v Miller, 70 AD3d 1120, 1120-1121 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 890 [2010]; People v Watson, 62 AD3d 1032, 1033-1034 [2009]).
Defendant was properly sentenced as a second felony offender. By not controverting the legitimacy of his prior conviction at sentencing or moving to vacate the judgment or sentence, he failed to preserve this argument (see People v Bynum, 68 AD3d 1348, 1350 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 798 [2010]). We decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction with respect to this aspect of the sentence because County Court and the prosecutor substantially complied with CPL 400.21 (see id.). Finally, County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence, which we do not find harsh or excessive considering that defendant has a serious criminal history and absconded after his arraignment on the present indictment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), rendered November 14, 1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was arrested on the basis of two incidents which took place in August of 1983, when he was alleged to have sold a quantity of heroin to a police informant. He was initially arraigned on the basis of two felony complaints. At that time, defendant was not represented by counsel.
On September 30, 1983, defendant was indicted by the Grand Jury on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.39 [1]). Shortly thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence of 5 to 15 years, and this appeal ensued.
Defendant’s primary contentions on this appeal are that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that his sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. We reject both of those contentions.
Following his indictment on the charges, defendant was represented by counsel from arraignment through sentencing. While defendant urges ineffectiveness on the part of his assigned counsel in not pursuing a defense theory of entrapment, there is no reason to conclude that such a tactic would have been successful. Where defense counsel reasonably can conclude that a pretrial procedure or defense tactic would be unavailing, counsel is not obliged to pursue it further (People v Peters, 90 AD2d 618, 619; see, People v Bramble, 103 AD2d 1019). The record of the colloquy between the court and defendant at the time defendant pleaded guilty establishes that he was fully advised of his rights and the consequences of his plea, and manifested his understanding of the nature and consequences of that act (People v Peters, supra, p 619). From the record before us, we are unable to find that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at any stage of the proceeding.
On the basis of defendant’s prior criminal record and the plea bargain arrangement he agreed to, we find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of sentence by County Court, which was in compliance with the provisions of Penal Law § 70.00 (2) (c) and (3) (b).

Defendant contends that County Court never acquired jurisdiction over this matter, with the issue specifically distilling to whether defendant was appropriately held for action of the grand jury prior to his waiver of indictment. “[A] defendant may waive indictment and consent to be prosecuted by a [superior court information] when, among other conditions not in issue here, a local criminal court has held the defendant for [g]rand [j]ury action” (People v Barber, 280 AD2d 691, 692 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 825 [2001]; see CPL 195.10 [1]; People v D'Amico, 76 NY2d 877, 879 [1990]). “Being so ‘held’ for the action of a [g]rand [j]ury involves the filing of a felony complaint on which defendant has been arraigned and a finding after a preliminary hearing (unless waived by defendant) that reasonable cause exists to believe that defendant committed a felony” (People v Barber, supra at 692 [emphasis added]; see People v D'Amico, supra at 879).
Here, defendant was arraigned upon the felony complaint and, although he initially requested that a preliminary hearing be conducted on a specific date in the future, he nevertheless voluntarily entered his plea of guilty before that date, thereby effectively waiving his right to the hearing. Because defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing and “the record of the plea proceeding establishes that the Superior Court was satisfied with the waiver [of indictment] and executed an order to that effect (see, CPL 195.30), we may presume that the matter was properly before that court” (People v Chad S., 237 AD2d 986, 986 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 856 [1997]). Defendant’s remaining assertions concerning the validity of County Court’s jurisdiction, to the extent not specifically addressed herein, have been examined and found to be unavailing.
As for defendant’s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive, we decline to review this issue given his knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; People v Tate, 28 AD3d 801 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered August 5, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment and thereafter was sentenced to an indeterminate term of SVs years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals contending that his guilty plea was not entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently because he was not conversant with the English language. Alternatively, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
Initially, we note that upon a prior appeal to this Court, we determined that despite defendant’s failure to move to vacate the judgment or withdraw his guilty plea, the assignment of new counsel was warranted to address nonfrivolous appealable issues regarding the voluntariness of defendant’s plea (see, People v Serna, 262 AD2d 673). Nevertheless, upon our review of the merits, we are unpersuaded that these issues require reversal as an exercise of our discretion in the interest of justice. A transcript of the plea proceedings reveals that defendant capably responded, in English, to the questions put to him, giving no indication that he was having difficulty understanding the proceedings such as would have alerted County Court to the need for an interpreter (see, People v Ramos, 26 NY2d 272, 275). Indeed, inasmuch as defendant stated on the record that he had conferred with his attorney, that he understood the ramifications of his plea and that he was entering his guilty plea freely and voluntarily, we find no basis for vacating the guilty plea (see, People v Espinal, 176 AD2d 417, 418). Finally, defendant’s lack of criminal history notwithstanding, we see no reason to disturb the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence (see, People v O’Byrne, 262 AD2d 867, 868, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered March 4, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a reduced charge under count one of a six-count indictment. He waived his right to appeal during the plea colloquy and was thereafter sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, as a second felony offender, to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant argues that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. However, after County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from those rights being forfeited as a result of his guilty plea, defendant executed a written appeal waiver in open court that indicated that he had discussed the matter with his attorney, fully understood the rights he was relinquishing and that he was “waiving [his] right to appeal voluntarily, knowingly, intelligently, and without coercion by anyone.” Defendant also affirmed that he was willingly waiving his right to appeal on the record and, in response to multiple inquiries from County Court, stated that he had no questions regarding the issue. Under such circumstances, we find that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see People v Dennis, 66 AD3d 1058, 1058 [2009]; People v Tabbott, 61 AD3d 1183, 1184 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 750 [2009]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967-968 [2008]).

In satisfaction of a seven-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was to be sentenced to a prison term of no more than 51/2 to 11 years and no less than 5 to 10 years.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Lea-man, J.), rendered October 28, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following his arrest on drug possession charges, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a superior court information and certain uncharged crimes. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defense counsel and the People offered a joint recommendation that defendant be sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4x/2 to 9 years. Following the sentencing hearing, however, County Court imposed a sentence of 71/2 to 15 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends that County Court abused its discretion ""in failing to accept the joint sentencing recommendation and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree. County Court was not bound by the sentencing recommendation and could properly impose a more severe sentence based upon defendant’s extensive criminal history (see, People v Moore, 270 AD2d 715, 716; People v Hadsell, 249 AD2d 682, 684, lv denied 92 NY2d 852). Moreover, we find nothing in the record to support defendant’s contention that County Court erred in failing to consider any relevant mitigating factors presented during the sentencing hearing (see, People v Ormsby, 242 AD2d 840, lvs denied 91 NY2d 895, 975). Finally, under the circumstances of this case and in light of the information revealed in the presentence report, we are not persuaded that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive (see, People v McCoy, 266 AD2d 589, 592, lv denied 94 NY2d 905; People v Beecher, 225 AD2d 943, 946) or that defendant’s history of substance abuse provides extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention (see, People v McKenzie, 263 AD2d 778, 780, lv denied 93 NY2d 1045).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Putnam County (Reitz, J.), rendered April 24, 2014, convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon her plea of guilty, and sentencing her to a determinate term of imprisonment of seven years, followed by a period of postrelease supervision, and a fine in the sum of $5,000.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the determinate term of imprisonment imposed from seven years to 3V2 years and the fine imposed from $5,000 to $1,000; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant contends that her plea of guilty was not knowing, voluntary, or intelligent because the County Court failed to inquire whether she had consulted with her attorney about the constitutional rights under Boykin v Alabama (395 US 238 [1969]) that she was forfeiting by pleading guilty. While this issue would survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Murphy, 114 AD3d 704, 705 [2014]; People v Joseph, 103 AD3d 665 [2013]; People v Ballinger, 12 AD3d 686, 687 [2004]), it is nonetheless unpreserved for appellate review, since the defendant did not move to vacate her plea prior to the imposition of sentence or otherwise raise the issue in the County Court (see People v Sirico, 135 AD3d 19, 22 [2015]; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d 1081 [2015]; People v Bennett, 122 AD3d 871, 872 [2014]). In any event, since the County Court expressly advised the defendant of the Boykin rights and other constitutional rights that she was waiving by pleading guilty, and the record affirmatively demonstrates the defendant’s understanding and waiver of these constitutional rights, we find that the plea of guilty was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 19-20 [1983]; People v Sirico, 135 AD3d at 22; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d at 1082; People v Jackson, 114 AD3d 807, 807-808 [2014]).
While a defendant who has validly waived the right to appeal cannot invoke this Court’s interest of justice jurisdiction to obtain a reduced sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]), here, the Court is not precluded from exercising its interest of justice jurisdiction, since the defendant’s purported waiver of her right to appeal was invalid. The record does not demonstrate that the defendant understood the distinction between the right to appeal and other trial rights forfeited incident to her plea of guilty (see People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 893 [2006]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 257; People v Gordon, 127 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2015]; People v Cantarero, 123 AD3d 841, 841 [2014]; People v Ayala, 112 AD3d 646 [2013]). Furthermore, although the defendant executed a written appeal waiver form, there is no indication on the record that the County Court obtained an acknowledgment from the defendant that she had, in fact, signed the waiver or, if she had, she was aware of its contents or discussed it with defense counsel (see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; People v Gordon, 127 AD3d at 1231; People v Brown, 122 AD3d 133, 145 [2014]). Accordingly, despite the defendant’s execution of a written waiver of her right to appeal, she did not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently waive her right to appeal (see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d at 510; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d at 283).
The sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated herein (see People v Gordon, 132 AD3d 904 [2015]; People v Velasquez, 181 AD2d 751 [1992]; People v Irby, 95 AD2d 839 [1983]; People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered March 24, 2006, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of, inter alia, the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a three-count indictment, and to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a separate superior court information. Defendant also admitted violating a previously imposed condition of probation. She waived her right to appeal in writing and orally during the plea colloquy. As agreed, she was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of two years for the criminal sale conviction and four years for the attempted criminal sale conviction, along with periods of postrelease supervision. With regard to the probation violation, her probation was revoked and she was sentenced to time served. This appeal ensued.
Defendant, as limited by her brief, challenges only her conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Specifically, defendant contends that her plea of guilty to that crime was involuntary. While this claim survives defendant’s appeal waiver (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]), defendant never moved to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and, thus, this contention has not been preserved for our review (see People v Decker, 32 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2006]; People v Sebast, 32 AD3d 615, 615 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 870 [2006]). Nevertheless, considering the claim, we find it to be without merit. Review of the plea proceedings demonstrates that defendant was fully apprised of her rights and the consequences of her plea, which she acknowledged she understood and she freely admitted the underlying facts of the crime and pleaded guilty to its commission. Further, there is nothing in the record to support defendant’s conclusory and self-serving assertions, raised now for the first time, that she was discouraged from taking her case to trial and led to believe that she had no alternative but to plead guilty (see People v Missimer, 32 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2006]). Accordingly, we find that defendant’s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Jones, 30 AD3d 633, 633 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 849 [2006]; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]).
Defendant’s challenge to the agreed-upon four-year prison sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded in light of her valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered March 27, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, he was to waive his right to appeal and be sentenced to a cap of one year of incarceration, followed by one year of postrelease supervision. In addition, County Court imposed certain conditions on the sentence advising defendant, among other things, that if he was arrested prior to sentencing, it would not be obligated to impose the agreed-upon sentence. Before sentencing, defendant was arrested on two separate occasions. Although defense counsel questioned the validity of these arrests, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, based upon defendant’s violation of the sentencing conditions. Defendant declined to complete his signing of the written waiver of his right to appeal at sentencing and he now appeals.
Defendant’s sole challenge is to County Court’s imposition of the enhanced sentence based upon his two arrests. When the validity of a postplea arrest is called into question, “the court must conduct an inquiry at which the defendant has an opportunity to show that the arrest is without foundation” (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993], cert denied 519 US 964 [1996]; see People v Fiammegta, 14 NY3d 90, 97 [2010]; People v Smalls, 85 AD3d 1450, 1451 [2011]). Significantly, “[t]he nature and extent of the inquiry — whether through a summary hearing pursuant to CPL 400.10 or some other fair means — is within the court’s discretion [but it] must be of sufficient depth, ... so that the court can be satisfied ... of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest” (People v Outley, 80 NY2d at 713 [internal citation omitted]).
Here, County Court did not conduct a formal evidentiary hearing regarding the validity of defendant’s two arrests, and one was not required (see id. at 713; People v Talbot, 114 AD3d 1000, 1001 [2014]). Instead, the court made an on-the-record inquiry during the sentencing proceeding at which it considered the accusatory instruments, supporting documentation and arguments of counsel before concluding that a legitimate basis existed for defendant’s arrests. Under the circumstances presented, we conclude that County Court’s inquiry was adequate and established that a legitimate basis existed for defendant’s arrests thereby warranting its imposition of the enhanced sentence (see People v Talbot, 114 AD3d at 1001; People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231[2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1023 [2014]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered July 28, 2009, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the second degree (nine counts).
While he was an inmate at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Washington County, defendant mailed letters containing a white powdery substance, which turned out to be foot powder, to various agencies, officials and organizations. As a result, he was convicted following a jury trial of nine counts of placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree. He was sentenced as a second felony offender on each count to a prison term of seven years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving. On appeal, this Court reduced all counts to placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the second degree and remitted the matter to County Court for resentencing (People v Lettley, 64 AD3d 901 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 836 [2009]). Thereafter, County Court resentenced defendant as a second violent felony offender on each count to a prison term of four years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, and directed them to run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentence he was then serving. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant has exhibited disturbing behavior in his plan to create hysteria and instill fear in parties completely unknown to him. In view of this, and given the violent nature of his prior crimes, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Nelson, 56 AD3d 899 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Sheridan, J.), rendered July 9, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and resisting arrest.
Defendant was charged in a nine-count indictment with ""various crimes involving the sale and possession of controlled substances. Following various negotiations, defendant agreed to plead guilty to the entire indictment in exchange for County Court’s promise to impose an aggregate sentence of 4V2 to 9 years. Thereafter, the court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison sentence of 4V2 to 9 years for each conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and each conviction of criminal, possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts). Defendant also received an indeterminate prison sentence of 2 to 4 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and a one-year determinate jail sentence for his conviction of resisting arrest. The court indicated that all sentences were to run concurrently.
In this appeal, defendant asserts that the indictment was defective because his prior felony conviction was not set forth in the indictment. As a result, defendant argues that he should not have been sentenced as a second felony offender. We do not agree. Defendant’s reliance upon the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Apprendi v New Jersey (530 US 466) is misplaced. The Court in Apprendi specifically stated that “the fact of a prior conviction” is not required to be submitted to a jury (id., at 490). Moreover, the Court of Appeals has stated that a “ [defendant [has] no constitutional right to a jury trial to establish the facts of * * * prior felony convictions” (People v Rosen, 96 NY2d 329, 335). Under these circumstances, defendant, previously sentenced as a predicate felon (see, e.g., People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982), and admitting the prior felony conviction at sentencing herein, cannot persuasively maintain that he was prejudiced by the fact that the existence of the prior felony was not contained in the indictment or discussed at any length during the plea allocution. Notably, defendant received the exact sentence promised during that allocution.
Next, defendant claims that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest with the Public Defender’s office created due to his complaints concerning the effectiveness of different attorneys from that office in a prior appeal (People v Conyers, supra). We note that defendant’s attorney herein was not a member of that office at the time. Significantly, this Court was not persuaded by defendant’s allegations concerning his former counsel (id.) and, in any event, defendant’s argument of a conflict of interest is not supported in this record. More importantly, we find no merit to defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel made appropriate motions and went to great lengths to ensure that defendant’s contentions regarding the alleged conflict of interest were placed on the record. Additionally, defense counsel negotiated a reasonable plea agreement for defendant and there exists no basis in this record to support defendant’s claim that he was prevented by his counsel from testifying before the Grand Jury. Notably, even if defendant could establish that defense counsel failed to effectuate his intent to testify before the Grand Jury, such a fact, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872; People v Williams, 267 AD2d 772, lvs denied 94 NY2d 886, 926). Thus, we find that defendant received “meaningful representation” within the appropriate standard (People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796, 799-800; see, People v Sowizdral, 275 AD2d 473, 475-476, lv denied 95 NY2d 969).
Defendant further contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive and should be modified. Here, County Court was aware of defendant’s lengthy criminal record and imposed concurrent sentences all within the statutory guidelines and in accordance with the plea bargain. Therefore, we find no reason to disturb the court’s sentencing determination (see, People v Archangel, 272 AD2d 686).
Defendant’s remaining arguments have been examined and found to be without merit.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered June 14, 1996, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of two indictments and a pending misdemeanor charge. County Court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years. We reject defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. When defendant entered her guilty plea, she did so knowing that the People would recommend the sentence which was ultimately imposed. In any event, the record reveals that the sentence was appropriate and we find no extraordinary circumstances to warrant a modification thereof (see, People v Douglas, 238 AD2d 632, lv denied 90 NY2d 857).

In June 1996, defendant was sentenced to, inter alia, five years’ probation upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. After defendant was arrested on September 29, 1996 on new drug charges he was subsequently charged with and, following a hearing, found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. As a result, County Court revoked defendant’s probation and sentenced him to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Notably, at the hearing, defendant admitted, inter alia, that he drank alcohol and possessed marihuana on the date of his arrest. Considering defendant’s prior drug-related conviction and his admission to violating the terms of his probation, and there being no extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention, we find the sentence, which was within the statutory parameters, neither harsh nor excessive (see, People v Dalton, 247 AD2d 656).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered February 14, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of seven years to life. Defendant raises four issues on this appeal. He first contends that it was reversible error to allow testimony of the undercover officer concerning three other drug related transactions with defendant for which defendant was not on trial. This contention is without merit. Due to an alleged alibi defense, identity became a major issue in the case. Evidence of other offenses is admissible where the sole purpose is to establish identity and the evidence is relevant to that issue. (People v Molineux, 168 NY 264; see, also, People v Condon, 26 NY2d 139, 142.) Next, defendant urges that there was a fatal defect in the chain of possession of the packages of heroin from the time they were purchased from defendant until they were finally examined by the chemist. On this record we find no apparent gap. The exhibit was properly sealed by the undercover officer and placed in an evidence locker at State Police headquarters. Later, it was taken by him to the State Police laboratory in Albany and turned over to the evidence clerk. The chemist testified that, after it was brought to the laboratory, it was placed in an evidence locker in a walk-in vault in the laboratory. Subsequently, he removed the exhibit from the vault and performed the chemical analysis on its contents. There is no suggestion in the record that the evidence was altered in any way up to the time of the chemist’s analysis. Under the circumstances, the chain of possession was adequately established. (People v Connelly, 35 NY2d 171; People v Porter, 46 AD2d 307.) Defendant’s remaining contentions also lack merit. The District Attorney’s statements in his summation did not go beyond the normal scope of fair advocacy. Moreover, if there was error, it was harmless and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. Moreover, none of the ascribed errors are constitutional in nature. Furthermore, the proof of defendant’s guilt, without reference to the alleged errors, was overwhelming. In our view there is no significant probability that the jury would have acquitted the defendant had it not been for the alleged errors. (People v Crimmina, 36 NY2d 230.) Finally, the Court of Appeals has recently put to rest the unconstitutional attack on the mandatory sentencing provisions of the statutes applied to defendant’s conviction.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered June 18, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and various other lesser counts of sale and possession of controlled substances. Although charged with a class A-I felony, defendant was allowed to plead to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony, in full satisfaction of the indictment and with a prison sentence of eight years to life. Defendant accepted the plea as offered and was sentenced as agreed. On this appeal he contends that his sentence was unduly harsh.
Inasmuch as defendant was facing a potential prison sentence ranging from 15 years to life up to 25 years to life if convicted as charged, we find the plea to the reduced charge and the sentence imposed to have been advantageous to defendant’s interests. The claim of excessiveness is untenable.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered March 10, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to two years in prison followed by one year of post-release supervision.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea, which survives his appeal waiver, is not preserved for our review absent a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251 [2009]). Furthermore, inasmuch as a review of the plea colloquy does not “clearly cast[ ] significant doubt upon . . . defendant’s guilt or otherwise call[ ] into question the voluntariness of the plea,” we are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine applies (People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; see People v Wilson, 16 AD3d 781, 781 [2005]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Seibert, Jr., J.), rendered December 19,1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to a prison term of 31/2 to 7 years. Defendant argues on appeal that the sentence is harsh and excessive in light of the fact that he received the harshest sentence permissible and would have been eligible for a less severe sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1995 (see, L 1995, ch 3). Given defendant’s lengthy criminal record and the fact that he agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we find this argument to be unpersuasive. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered December 6, 2004, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
In satisfaction of two indictments containing various drug-related offenses, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years. It was further agreed that sentencing would be delayed for a considerable period of time (apparently because defendant was a few months pregnant). County Court, however, twice advised defendant that if she were arrested during the ensuing time period, it would reserve the right to impose a harsher sentence. She was specifically advised that another arrest could result in consecutive, 5 to 15-year prison sentences.
While awaiting sentencing, defendant was again arrested and charged with additional drug-related crimes. At sentencing on the original charges, County Court was initially willing to accept a plea to the new charges and sentence her to an aggregate prison term of 4 to 12 years for all charges. During a plea allocution on the new charges, however, defendant indicated that she had not had sufficient time to confer with her attorney. County Court therefore refused to accept a plea to the new charges, ignored apparent attempts by defendant and her attorney to revisit the matter and proceeded to sentence her on the original charges. In light of her violation of the no-arrest condition of the plea, County Court sentenced her to consecutive, 2 to 6-year prison terms. She now appeals, and we affirm.
First, having failed to make a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant’s present argument that her plea was not knowing, intelligent or voluntary is not properly preserved for this Court’s review (see e.g. People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 895 [2006]). In any event, were we to reach the issue, our review of the plea colloquy convinces us that, despite certain misstatements by County Court, defendant indeed knew and understood the precise crimes to which she was pleading guilty, admitted the elements of these offenses and understood the consequences of her plea.
Defendant next argues that her sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice because it constituted retribution on the part of County Court for her statement during the plea allocution on the new charges that she had not had enough time to confer with her attorney. We are unconvinced that County Court’s imposition of the enhanced sentence—which could have been far greater—was an exercise of retribution. Defendant had been clearly warned that County Court could impose a harsher sentence than that initially agreed upon if she were arrested while out on bail awaiting sentence (cf. id. at 894; People v Donnelly, 23 AD3d 921, 922 [2005]). Moreover, despite the opportunity to do so, neither defendant nor her attorney in any way challenged the validity of her postplea arrest or denied defendant’s involvement therein (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Schnackenberg, 269 AD2d 618, 619 [2000], lv denied 94 NY2d 925 [2000]; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, 854-855 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 880 [1999]; People v Jackson, 221 AD2d 740, 740-741 [1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 974 [1996]; cf. People v Jenkins, 29 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2006]). Under these circumstances, enhancement of defendant’s sentence was certainly appropriate and not the product of vindictiveness on the part of the County Court (see People v Outley, supra).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered October 3, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and thereafter was sentenced as a second felony offender to eight years in prison, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the propriety of having been sentenced as a second felony offender.
We affirm. Contrary to his contention, “ ‘County Court was not obligated to expressly advise defendant of his right to contest the constitutionality of the prior conviction’ ” (People v Wood, 108 AD3d 932, 932-933 [2013], quoting People v Smith, 121 AD2d 771, 772 [1986]; see People v Wallace, 188 AD2d 499, 500 [1992]; People v West, 140 AD2d 852, 852 [1988]). Here, the record reveals that defendant was provided with the prior felony information before sentencing and, while represented by counsel during sentencing, declined to deny or controvert any of the allegations in the information. Accordingly, County Court substantially complied with the requirements of CPL 400.21 (3), and defendant was properly sentenced as a second felony offender (see People v Wood, 108 AD3d at 933).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered November 15, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence of seven years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. We reject defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea, and defendant acknowledged that he understood the ramifications of the waiver and executed a written waiver in open court. Accordingly, we conclude that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Neithardt, 127 AD3d 1502, 1502 [2015]; People v Brown, 125 AD3d 1049, 1049 [2015]). The valid appeal waiver precludes his claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Almeida, 127 AD3d 1499, 1500 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1006 [2015]; People v Turner, 126 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2015]), as well as his challenge to County Court’s denial of his application to redact certain information contained in the presentence investigation report (see People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]; People v Abdul, 112 AD3d 644, 645 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1136 [2014] ).
Defendant’s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that the plea allocution was not factually sufficient are not preserved for our review as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015]; People v Martin, 125 AD3d 1054, 1054 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 932 [2015]). Defendant “made no statements during the plea colloquy that would bring this matter within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement” (People v Pickett, 128 AD3d at 1276).
Finally, we reject defendant’s contention that he was illegally sentenced as a second violent felony offender, although he correctly notes that the People submitted a predicate felony offender statement that erroneously indicated that he was subject to being sentenced as a second violent felony offender (see Penal Law § 70.04 [1] [a]). The sentencing minutes reflect that County Court properly sentenced defendant as a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony (see Penal Law § 70.70 [4] [b] [i]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d 880, 881 n [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1040 [2013]). While the judgment is therefore affirmed, we note that the uniform sentence and commitment form incorrectly reflects that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender and it must be amended to reflect his status as a second felony drug offender with a prior violent felony conviction (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1472 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d at 881 n).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered June 14, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
When this case was previously before this Court, we rejected counsel’s Anders brief, withheld decision and assigned new counsel to represent defendant on appeal (139 AD3d 1110 [2016]). New counsel has submitted a brief challenging the validity of defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal and the severity of the sentence.
Turning to the appeal waiver, the record discloses that defendant executed a written waiver and related to County Court during the plea colloquy that he voluntarily signed it. County Court did not, however, explain the nature and ramifications of the waiver or ensure that defendant had read and understood it (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the waiver was invalid and does not preclude defendant from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]; People v Lemon, 137 AD3d at 1423).
Upon his plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Given defendant’s extensive criminal record and his acquiescence to the sentence as part of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Day, 133 AD3d 920, 920 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1095 [2015]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smyk, J.), rendered June 23, 1980, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In February 1975, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a minimum term of one year and a maximum term of life upon his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In 1980, defendant applied for resentencing pursuant to Penal Law § 60.09, and this application was granted. Subsequently, defendant was resentenced to a term of imprisonment with a minimum term of one year and a maximum term of 20 years.
Defendant contends that the sentencing court’s failure to afford his counsel an opportunity to address the court necessitates a remittal for resentencing. The District Attorney, with admirable candor, joins in this argument.
After conducting a review of the record, we find that, in the interest of justice, this matter should be remitted to County Court for resentencing (see, CPL 380.50; People v Lucks, 91 AD2d 896).

"—Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Cheeseman, J.), rendered September 4, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court (Turner, Jr., J.), rendered September 11, 1991, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant had previously been adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced to five years’ probation following his conviction of attempted reckless endangerment in the first degree. As a result of his possession conviction, defendant was also charged with violation of probation and subsequently pleaded guilty to that charge as well. Defendant was sentenced to a term of impris onment of 2 to 6 years for the possession conviction and, subsequently, to a consecutive term of imprisonment of ÍVz to 4 years on his conviction of violation of probation. Defendant appeals both sentences, contending that they are harsh and excessive.
Defendant’s plea to the possession charge was in satisfaction of a two-count indictment which included the more serious crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty to both that charge and the violation of probation charge knowing that he would receive the sentences imposed, which in the case of the possession conviction is much less than the harshest possible. Given these facts, as well as defendant’s criminal record and his obvious inability to abide by the terms of his probation, we find no basis to disturb the sentences imposed by County Court.

The plea agreement also included the waiver of the right to appeal. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, there was discussion regarding defendant’s eligibility for a shock incarceration program. Ultimately, defendant agreed to enter an additional plea of guilty to the remaining three counts of the indictment as well. This agreement was made with the understanding that, as a result of both pleas, he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to four concurrent 4x/2-year prison terms, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, together with an order directing his enrollment in a shock incarceration program. This additional agreement also included the waiver of the right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, his waivers of the right to appeal were valid. Based upon our review of the plea colloquies, County Court adequately distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea, particularly in light of defendant’s lengthy criminal history and his acknowledgment that he had previously executed an appeal waiver in regard to a previous guilty plea. Further, the court ensured that defendant understood the ramifications of the waivers and defendant executed a counseled written waiver in open court (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Butler, 134 AD3d 1349, 1349-1350 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 963 [2016]). Accordingly, defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. In light of his valid waivers of the right to appeal, his contention that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive is precluded (see People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1240 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]; People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Lomanto, J.), rendered August 27, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of four counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all charged and uncharged crimes relating to a 24-count indictment and in exchange for a sentence of four concurrent prison terms of 8 to 16 years. Two subsequent defense attorneys moved to vacate the plea prior to sentencing. After denying these motions, County Court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain.
During the plea colloquy, when asked whether he sold drugs to an undercover officer, defendant stated, “Most was set up through another guy. He called me up, told me that his friend wanted this stuff. I went and got it for him basically. * * * I never made no profit from it.” These statements raised the possibility of an agency defense.
If the agency defense applied here, defendant would not have been culpable in the sale of controlled substances (see People v Feldman, 50 NY2d 500, 503 [1980]). Agency is not an affirmative defense, but rather “may negate the existence of an essential element of the crime — the ‘sale’ ” (People v Roche, 45 NY2d 78, 86 [1978], cert denied 439 US 958 [1978]). Where the colloquy fails to establish all the elements of the crime, casts significant doubt on the defendant’s guilt, or raises the possibility of a defense which may negate an essential element, the court is put on notice of such situation and must take steps to ensure a valid plea (see People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]; People v Munck, 278 AD2d 662, 663 [2000]). Where facts implicating the agency defense are raised, a court may not accept the plea without first conducting further inquiry to assure that the defendant is aware of the possible defense and decides to plead despite its existence, thus assuring that the waiver of the defense is intelligent and voluntary (see People v Mosher, 222 AD2d 1034, 1035 [1995]; People v Davis, 176 AD2d 1236, 1237 [1991]; see also People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 677 [1999]).
Here, defendant’s statements during the plea colloquy indicated a possible agency defense. County Court erred in accepting his plea without inquiring further to determine defendant’s awareness of that defense and whether he chose to plead guilty anyway. Given the fact that the plea must be vacated on this ground, we decline to address the remaining issues.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered April 24, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an eight-count indictment and other pending charges. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to four years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant committed a prior violent felony, consented to the sentence as part of his plea agreement and received only six months more time in prison than the statutory minimum (see Penal Law §§ 60.04 [5]; 70.70 [4] [b] [ii]). As such, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lussier, 109 AD3d 1023, 1023 [2013]; People v Bell, 290 AD2d 729, 730 [2002]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered May 12, 2006, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In January 2002, defendant was charged in an 11-count indictment with various drug-related crimes and ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction thereof (People v Lerario, 1 AD3d 635, 635-636 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004]). Defendant thereafter was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 10 years to life in prison (id. at 636). County Court granted defendant’s subsequent motion for resentencing with regard to his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree pursuant to the provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (see L 2005, ch 643) and, following a hearing, resentenced defendant, by judgment rendered May 12, 2006 and amended judgment rendered June 21, 2006, to a prison term of eight years and five years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Preliminarily, we decline the People’s invitation to dismiss the instant appeal because defendant appealed from only County Court’s May 12, 2006 judgment. Rather, we will exercise our discretion, in the interest of justice, and treat the notice of appeal as valid (see CPL 460.10 [6]).
Turning to the merits, defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the resentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We cannot agree. The determinate term that defendant received upon resentencing was well within the permissible statutory range (see Penal Law § 70.71 [3] [b] [ii]; § 220.18) and, upon our review of the record as a whole, and taking into consideration the serious nature of the underlying crimes and defendant’s criminal history, we perceive no abuse of discretion or extraordinary cir cumstances warranting a reduction thereof (see People v Marrero, 41 AJD3d 1091 [2007]; People v Thompson, 33 AD3d 1131 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Pulver, Jr., J.), rendered August 9, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Having pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 21h years in prison and one year of postrelease supervision. The sole argument raised by defendant on this appeal is that the predicate felony statement filed by the People was defective inasmuch as it did not indicate that his prior felony conviction was a violent felony. Defendant’s failure to raise this issue before County Court, however, has rendered the matter unpreserved for our review (see People v Collier, 35 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2006]; People v Ochs, 16 AD3d 971, 971 [2005]). In any event, although the statement did not satisfy the technical requirements of CPL 400.21 (2), County Court read the statement to defendant and he freely admitted that he was validly convicted of the prior felony described therein. Having received adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to the prior conviction, the statutory requirements were substantially complied with (see People v Collier, supra at 1038; People v Ochs, supra at 972).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Avery, Jr., J.), rendered April 15, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged, under two indictments, with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, single counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees and two counts of criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of all counts contained in both indictments. Defendant’s plea agreement was conditioned on defendant cooperating with the Cortland County Drug Task Force and in exchange for his cooperation, he would receive 2 to 6 years in prison for each count to be served concurrently. However, defendant was informed before accepting the plea agreement that unless he fully cooperated with the Drug Task Force he would not receive concurrent prison sentences. Prior to sentencing, the Drug Task Force informed County Court that defendant had failed to cooperate. Therefore, County Court imposed a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison for each count to be served consecutively.
Defendant appeals his sentence contending that it was harsh and excessive. In light of the seriousness and extensiveness of defendant’s crimes and the fact that defendant was fully apprised that he would not be sentenced to concurrent sentences if he failed to cooperate with the Drug Task Force, the sentence was not harsh and excessive (see, People v Fernandez, 263 AD2d 673, lv denied 94 NY2d 822). Finding no extraordinary circumstances, we decline to exercise our discretion to modify the sentence in the interest of justice (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Marcano, 265 AD2d 673).

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered February 22, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In conjunction with a 278-count indictment accusing more than 30 people of involvement in an enterprise to distribute and sell cocaine, defendant was charged in 10 counts of the indictment with conspiracy in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Thereafter, he entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he would plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waive his right to appeal and promise cooperation against his codefendants in exchange for a prison sentence of six years followed by three years of post-release supervision. Subsequent to his plea, the Organized Crime Task Force prosecuting the case informed County Court that defendant had failed to fulfill his obligation to cooperate under the plea agreement. Accordingly, the court found the agreement not to be enforceable and thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a prison term of 10 years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver; County Court adequately informed him that his right to appeal was separate from the other rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea, the written appeal waiver he executed in open court similarly informed him of that fact, and he was provided with ample time to confer with counsel to ensure that he fully understood the impact of his waiver (see People v Campbell, 114 AD3d 996, 997 [2014]; People v Osgood, 111 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1089 [2014]). Accordingly, defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed by his valid waiver of appeal (see People v Osgood, 111 AD3d at 1030; People v Durham, 110 AD3d 1145, 1145 [2013]). While defendant’s contention that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent survives his appeal waiver, it has not been preserved for our review, as the record before us does not indicate that he moved to withdraw his plea (see People v Monk, 113 AD3d 999, 1000 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable as defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that called into question either his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Brabham, 112 AD3d 1066, 1067 [2013]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d 988, 988-989 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1137 [2014]).
Turning to defendant’s contentions with regard to his sentence, we are unconvinced that County Court imposed the enhanced sentence without making an adequate inquiry into whether or not defendant complied with the cooperation requirement of the plea agreement (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Crowder, 110 AD3d 1384, 1385-1386 [2013], lv granted 22 NY3d 1155 [2014]). While a valid appeal waiver typically precludes a challenge to the severity of even an enhanced sentence, the waiver does not foreclose such challenge where, as here, a defendant has not been advised of the maximum potential sentence at the time of the plea (see People v Powers, 302 AD2d 685, 686 [2003]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 800 n [2001]; see generally People v Edie, 100 AD3d 1262, 1262 [2012]). Nonetheless upon review, we discern no abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013]; People v Bressard, 112 AD3d at 989).
We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions, including those raised in his pro se brief, and have found them to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J), rendered June 17, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was charged in an 11-count indictment with various drug-related crimes after police recovered drug paraphernalia, a firearm and a quantity of cocaine in a bungalow in the Town of Fallsburg, Sullivan County. Two of defendant’s brothers were also charged with drug-related crimes and the District Attorney made a collective plea offer. Pursuant to the offer, de fendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 10 years to life in prison. At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, claiming that he was innocent and was coerced into accepting the plea offer by virtue of its collective nature. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accordance with the agreement, prompting this appeal.
“The decision whether to permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the discretion of the trial court, ‘and only in rare instances will a hearing be granted’ ” (People v Bolden, 289 AD2d 607, 608 [2001], lv denied 98 NY2d 649 [2002] , quoting People v Yell, 250 AD2d 869, 869 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 863 [1998]; see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Totman, 269 AD2d 617, 618 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 839 [2000]). “Generally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in its inducement” (People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940 [1998] [citation omitted]; see People v McDonnell, 302 AD2d 619, 620 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 540 [2003]). Here, defendant did not protest his innocence during the plea allocution. To the contrary, he admitted that he possessed both the gun and cocaine weighing in excess of four ounces and also that he sold a quantity of cocaine (see People v Davis, supra at 940). In addition, he informed County Court that he understood he did not have to plead guilty and was satisfied with his attorney’s advice regarding the plea. At no point did he state that he felt pressured into accepting the plea due to the collective nature of the plea offer. In sum, there is nothing in the record to indicate that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion without a hearing (see People v Robinson, 301 AD2d 745, 747 [2003] , lv denied 100 NY2d 542 [2003]; People v Davis, supra).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Lalor, J.), rendered June 24, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. He moved to suppress the evidence seized as well as certain statements he made to the police. Following a suppression hearing, County Court granted suppression of the statements, but not of the tangible physical evidence. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to five years to life in prison. He now appeals.
Upon reviewing the record, we note that defendant waived his right to appeal all aspects of the case, including the preplea rulings, the judgment of conviction and sentence. This was done as part of defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea. Under these circumstances, we find that defendant is precluded from challenging County Court’s ruling on his suppression motion (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Williams, 6 AD3d 746, 747 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 650 [2004]; People v Boyce, 2 AD3d 1208, 1208 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 737 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered November 7, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant, who was on parole, pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of a 35-count indictment that charged him and his fiancée with numerous crimes in connection with their involvement in multiple drug transactions. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant executed a written waiver of appeal in open court. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony, to an agreed-upon prison term of 17 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. County Court also ordered defendant’s sentence to run consecutively to any remaining undischarged term of imprisonment that he was required to serve. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s initial contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Defendant, who had extensive prior knowledge of the criminal justice system, was advised during the plea colloquy “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,” and defendant acknowledged that he was expected to waive that right as a component of the plea agreement (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341-342 [2015]). Defendant then executed a detailed written waiver of the right to appeal and advised County Court that he had only done so after discussing the document with defense counsel. The written waiver and plea colloquy accordingly establish that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal from his conviction and sentence (see People v Vellon, 128 AD3d 1274, 1274-1275 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1043 [2015]; People v Brown, 125 AD3d 1049, 1049 [2015]).

As a result of an investigation into narcotics trafficking by the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant was charged in an indictment with conspiracy in the second degree and two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

County Court thoroughly advised defendant of the constitutional rights being forfeited upon a guilty plea (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]), and then asked whether, “separate and apart, independent of the trial rights you give up by virtue of the plea, do you understand [that] the plea bargain requires that you give up your right to appeal the conviction as well as the sentence that I will impose here?” Defendant responded in the affirmative. This colloquy confirms that defendant was duly apprised of the distinction between the rights automatically forfeited upon a plea and the additional requirement here of an appeal waiver. Given defendant’s valid appeal waiver, his challenge to the severity of the sentence is foreclosed (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]).
Defendant’s claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary and that counsel failed to provide effective assistance with respect to the plea survive the appeal waiver, but were not preserved for our review by an appropriate postallocution motion, and no statements were made during the plea colloquy triggering the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]; People v Pickett, 128 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015]). Recognizing as much in his brief, defendant seeks to have us vacate the plea in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [a]). We are not persuaded to do so.
The majority of defendant’s claims concern matters that are outside the record on appeal, such as what counsel discussed with or provided to him, and are more properly raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Taylor, 135 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2016]). Further, a review of the plea allocution demonstrates that defendant was adequately informed of the plea terms and the rights that he was foregoing, that he understood the consequences of his plea and had sufficient time to discuss the proof against him and possible defenses with counsel. Defendant confirmed that he was pleading guilty of his own free will and unequivocally admitted the charged conduct. Moreover, defendant expressed satisfaction with counsel, who negotiated a favorable plea deal to a single sale count for which defendant received a sentence well below the maximum possible consecutive sentences if he had been convicted on each of the cocaine sales (see Penal Law §§ 70.25 [3]; 70.70 [1] [b]; [3] [b] [i]). That defendant opted to plead guilty, confirming that he had sold cocaine even though the lab test results may not have been available to him, does not compromise the viability of the plea. As such, were these issues properly before us, we would find that they lack merit.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Siedlecki, J.), rendered March 25, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant contends that his sentence of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. The sentence defendant received was well within the statutory guidelines and was in accordance with the plea bargain. Given these circumstances, as well as defendant’s past criminal history and the fact that the sentence was not the harshest possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903; People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Sherman, J.), rendered May 6, 1996, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Based upon defendant’s admission at the plea colloquy and the information contained in the presentence report that she had a prior felony conviction, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 3 to 6 years, executed as a sentence of parole supervision. Defendant contends that her sentence is illegal in that she was erroneously sentenced as a second felony offender because at the time the instant sentence was imposed she was awaiting resentencing for the prior felony conviction due to her parole having been revoked. Although defendant waived her right to appeal as part of her plea agreement, she is not precluded from challenging the legality of her sentence (see, People v Laureano, 87 NY2d 640, 643). We find that defendant did, however, waive this claim because she failed to challenge the use of her prior felony conviction to establish her status as a second felony offender (see, People v Hamilton, 205 AD2d 706, 707, lv denied 84 NY2d 868). In any event, defendant’s contention is without merit inasmuch as she had been convicted and sentenced to a term of probation for the prior felony prior to the occurrence of the instant offense (see, People v Leight, 90 Misc 2d 233, 235).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered March 7, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In November 2003, defendant was indicted and charged with, among other things, multiple counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance. Defendant ultimately was extradited from Arizona and arraigned on the indictment in Saratoga County in September 2004. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to an agreed upon sentence of IV2 to 3 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant first challenges the voluntariness of his plea. While he acknowledges that this challenge is not preserved for our review in that he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction (see People v Booth, 23 AD3d 766, 767 [2005]), he nonetheless asserts that his plea comes within a recognized exception to the preservation requirement, to wit, that during the plea allocution he made statements that cast doubt on his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). We disagree. The record here reveals that defendant was fully informed about and understood the terms of the plea agreement and that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into it.
Defendant further argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to move to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds. In that regard, we merely note that the record is inadequate to resolve such a claim and, as such, it is more appropriately raised by way of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 632 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]). We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Williams, J.), rendered January 26, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On March 11, 1987, defendant was indicted for two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On June 17, 1987, defendant was charged in another indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marihuana, all allegedly committed at the time of his arrest on the first set of charges. County Court assigned the same counsel to represent defendant on each indictment.
On December 8, 1987, defendant appeared before Supreme Court Justice Robert C. Williams, acting as Sullivan County Judge, and, in response to the court’s inquiry, indicated that he had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the significance of the plea proceedings with his assigned counsel. Thereupon, the District Attorney recited into the record the plea arrangement that had been agreed upon among the District Attorney, defendant and his counsel. Defendant agreed that terms of the agreement were satisfactory and entered guilty pleas to the first count of each indictment in full satisfaction of all charges.
On January 25, 1988, when the parties again appeared before Justice Williams for sentencing, defendant’s attorney advised the court that defendant wished to withdraw his guilty plea. After counsel presented the court with eight handwritten yellow pages wherein defendant somewhat incoherently tried to explain his misunderstanding of the process that resulted in the indictments against him, Justice Williams remanded defendant until the following day so that he could read the allocution minutes made at the time of the plea. On January 26, 1988 the court reporter read the minutes into the record. They revealed that the District Attorney was willing to accept a plea of guilty to the first count of each indictment in full satisfaction of both instruments in exchange for a recommended prison sentence of 2 to 6 years on each count, to run concurrently, and that defendant and his counsel agreed to accept the recommendation. The court, after reciting into the record that it found no evidence that would cause it to believe that defendant was threatened or coerced into pleading guilty, imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals claiming that his request to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted in light of his repeated complaints to Sullivan County Judge Eugene M. Hanofee about his assigned counsel’s lack of attention to his case.
Defendant’s reliance on People v McKennion (27 NY2d 671) to support his contention that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea should have been granted is misplaced. Here, Justice Williams afforded defendant a reasonable opportunity to advance his claims and, after weighing the same, made an informed and prudent determination that the motion should be denied (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 525-526). Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his plea of guilty was induced by his attorney’s failure to adequately inform him of the reasons that a guilty plea was in his best interest. The court meticulously interrogated the District Attorney, defense counsel and defendant during the reading of the plea allocution minutes and was satisfied that defendant fully understood the consequences of his guilty plea (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17; People v Frederick, supra; People v Murphy, 142 AD2d 776).
Finally, while assigned counsel was somewhat remiss in the frequency of his visits to defendant while he was incarcerated, given the favorable sentences he negotiated on defendant’s behalf in exchange for guilty pleas to very serious crimes, we cannot conclude on this record that counsel was guilty of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137,147).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Madison County, rendered October 16, 1975, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a maximum of life and a minimum of one year. In December of 1974, the Grand Jury of Madison County indicted defendant for the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law, § 220.18, subd 4), and in the third degree (Penal Law, § 220.16, subd 6). Upon his arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty to both charges and subsequently moved, inter alia, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence before the Grand Jury was insufficient. Finding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the indictment, however, the County Court denied this motion on September 23, 1975, and immediately thereafter and as a result of plea bargaining, it was agreed by the parties that defendant would withdraw his plea of not guilty to both charges and enter a plea of guilty to the second count, criminal possession in the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictment. It was likewise agreed that defendant would receive an indeterminate sentence of one year to life, and he was sentenced accordingly on October 16, 1975. On this appeal, defendant initially contends that the indictment against him should have been dismissed because the evidence before the Grand Jury was provided by accomplices and uncorroborated. Perusal of the Grand Jury minutes leads us to conclude otherwise. Assuming arguendo that the main witness before the Grand Jury was an accomplice and that the defendant was not foreclosed by his guilty plea from raising this argument on appeal, the testimony of the alleged accomplice was such that a jury might be reasonably satisfied that the accomplice was telling the truth (cf. People v Daniels, 37 NY2d 624, 630). Moreover, the testimony of the undercover agent, given after investigation and surveillance, established that the defendant was in the company of persons possessing and preparing for sale large quantities of drugs (People v Daniels, supra) and thus tended to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense (CPL 60.22, subd 1). The corroborating testimony harmonized with the accomplice’s narrative so as to have a tendency to furnish the necessary connection between the defendant and the crime (People v Morhouse, 21 NY2d 66, 74). Accordingly, the indictment was properly sustained. Similarly without merit are defendant’s contentions that he should have been placed on life probation in lieu of the sentence imposed and that the County Court should have required the District Attorney to include a recommendation for parole in a statement pursuant to subdivision 4 of section 214 of the Correction Law. No extraordinary circumstances are presented to justify our disturbance of the sentence (People v Dittmar, 41 AD2d 788; People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861), which was clearly authorized for the class A-III felony conviction here (Penal Law, § 70.00, subds 2, 3). As to the cited section of the Correction Law, that relates to reports by prison wardens to the Board of Parole and was obviously misconstrued by defendant. We have considered defendant’s remaining arguments and find them to be without substance. Judgment affirmed. Greenblott, J.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered March 15, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in return for a negotiated prison sentence of 3V2 years and three years of postrelease supervision. He subsequently was sentenced in County Court to the agreed-upon sentence. No mention was made on the record, at any time prior to or during the plea allocution or at sentencing, of the potential for defendant to be adjudicated a second felony offender or a second felony drug offender (see Penal Law § 70.06 [1]; § 70.70 [1] [b]). The following day, and for the first time, the District Attorney filed a predicate felony statement and the court acknowledged that no such statement had been filed prior to defendant’s sentencing. When defendant, who had been returned to court, admitted the predicate felony, the court stated, “I adjudicate the defendant to be a second felony offender.” Defendant was not resentenced or provided with an opportunity to withdraw his plea. He now appeals, contending that his sentence was invalid, his plea was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent and counsel was ineffective for failure to pursue these issues.
Pursuant to CPL 400.21 (2), a predicate statement “must be filed by the prosecutor before sentence is imposed” (emphasis added), which was not done here. Where the statutory purposes for filing a predicate statement have been satisfied, i.e., “apprising the court of the prior conviction and providing defendant with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard” (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]), substantial compliance has been found to be adequate (see People v Saddlemire, 50 AD3d 1317 [2008] [the defendant had notice and opportunity to be heard at sentencing regarding predicate, and admitted it]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966 [2008] [the defendant admitted predicate at sentencing]; People v Jones, 47 AD3d 1121 [2008] [the defendant given copy of statement and admitted at sentencing]; People v Ladson, 30 AD3d 836, 837 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 814 [2006] [statement filed before sentencing, the defendant acknowledged predicate but not asked if he wanted to controvert]; People v Valderama, 25 AD3d 819, 820-821 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 854 [2006]; see also People v Ruffin, 42 AD3d 582 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 881 [2007] [defective statement filed, the defendant had notice and opportunity to be heard at sentencing]; People v Johnson, 24 AD3d 967, 969 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 814 [2006]). Here, however, no statement was filed prior to or at sentencing; the record does not reflect that notice was given to defendant prior to sentencing or that defendant had an opportunity to be heard with respect to the prosecutor seeking predicate sentencing (cf. People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d at 1142; People v Saddlemire, supra; People v Ruffin, 42 AD3d at 582).
Further, defendant never agreed at the plea allocution to be sentenced as a predicate offender and, hence, cannot be said to have waived his rights under CPL 400.21 when he proceeded to sentencing without objection in the absence of a predicate statement or substantial compliance with the statutory scheme (cf. People v Ross, 7 NY3d 905, 906 [2006] [the defendant agreed at plea to predicate sentencing, so court held that he waived receipt of statement at sentencing and declined to challenge predicate]). Likewise, defendant’s admission to the predicate after sentence was imposed did not validate the sentence or constitute a waiver of the invalid sentence. Thus, there was no compliance with CPL 400.21 and “the complete failure to file a felony offender statement prior to sentencing renders the sentence invalid as a matter of law” (People v De Fayette, 16 AD3d 708, 710 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005] [no statement ever filed]; see People v Pierre, 8 AD3d 904, 906-907 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]). Accordingly, we must remit to County Court for resentencing pursuant to CPL 400.21.
To the extent that defendant contends that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent in view of the failure to include the predicate sentencing status as part of the plea agreement or to mention it at any point prior to sentencing, he did not preserve this claim for appellate review by moving to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 40 AD3d 1276, 1276 [2007]). Given that defendant can raise this issue upon remittal for resentencing, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [3], [b]). Defendant also alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based upon counsel’s failure to advise him regarding the significance of the prosecutor’s failure to file a predicate statement. This too is an issue not preserved for review (see People v McKeney, 45 AD3d 974, 975 [2007]) and, as it concerns matters outside the record, it should more properly be raised in a CPL article 440 motion (see id. at 975).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered June 1, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In March 2011, in satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, County Court informed defendant of his maximum sentence exposure as a predicate felon and agreed not to impose a sentence greater than 3Vs years in prison followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. At that time, the court informed defendant before releasing him pending sentencing that, if he were arrested for any reason prior to the sentencing date, the court would no longer be bound by the sentencing commitment. Thereafter, while released awaiting sentencing, defendant was arrested on new felony drug charges in Warren County. The court ultimately found that defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an enhanced prison term of SVa years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This appeal followed.
Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s claim that County Court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into defendant’s post-plea arrest before imposing an enhanced sentence. Our review confirms that the court made an inquiry of sufficient depth so as to “be satisfied — not of defendant’s guilt of the new criminal charge[s] but of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest on th[ose] charge[s]” (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; see People v Purcelle, 107 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2013]). Here, after defendant was initially questioned regarding the new arrest, he denied involvement and the court promptly ordered an adjournment in order to find out if this was a “viable arrest” in violation of the plea agreement. At defendant’s subsequent appearance, the court was in receipt of a May 2011 nine-count indictment charging defendant with numerous crimes, including criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant’s counsel then relayed that defendant entered a “not guilty plea” to the new charges, but also admitted that defendant’s undisputed “arrest alone would be a violation of the plea agreement” and requested leniency as to the sentence. When ask to respond, defendant stated that he agreed with his counsel’s statements. Although defendant maintains that a more formal Outley hearing should have been directed, this claim is unpreserved due to his failure on this record “to seek such a hearing or otherwise move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction” (People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]). In any event, it is apparent from the record that the court “imposed the enhanced sentence only after it was sufficiently assured that the information upon which it based the sentence was reliable and accurate” (People v French, 72 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]).
Lastly, defendant maintains that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive under the circumstances. We disagree. Given defendant’s demonstrated disregard of the no-arrest restriction in the plea agreement, coupled with his criminal history and “the fact that the enhanced sentence was less than the statutory maximum, we find no extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice” (People v Douglas, 2 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 761 [2004]; see People v Clapper, 87 AD3d 1227, 1227-1228 [2011] ; People v White, 24 AD3d 817, 817 [2005]; see also Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i]).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), entered December 20, 1984, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, without a hearing.
Defendant was indicted for one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (Penal Law § 220.21 [1]). Subsequently, pursuant to plea negotiations, he pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law § 220.18) and was sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain to a prison term of 8 Vs years to life.
Defendant appealed his conviction, which was affirmed without opinion by this court (99 AD2d 931). Thereafter, defendant moved pursuant to CPL article 440 for an order vacating his conviction. In his motion, defendant argued that the plea colloquy was insufficient and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. County Court, without a hearing, denied defendant’s motion and this appeal, by permission, ensued.
First, we have reviewed the plea colloquy and find it to be sufficient. Moreover, adequate appellate review of this issue was available upon appeal from the judgment of conviction. Accordingly, this aspect of the motion was properly denied (see, CPL 440.10 [2]).
Second, a review of the record reveals that there is no merit to defendant’s contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel obtained a plea to the lesser charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree with a sentence of 8 Vs years to life, whereas defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, with a possible sentence of 25 years to life (see, Penal Law § 70.00). It cannot be said that counsel’s advice to defendant to accept this plea offer prior to the suppression hearing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant has simply failed to set forth sufficient facts to make a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, defendant’s motion was properly denied without a hearing.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Turner, Jr., J.), rendered January 8, 1991, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was convicted after trial of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 12 Vi to 25 years. We find no error in County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion for dismissal of the indictment on the basis of the People’s failure to comply with CPL 30.30. The People announced their readiness for trial within the time set forth in that statute. We also find no merit to defendant’s allegation that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. The record does not support defendant’s contentions that the People misrepresented relevant facts, suborned perjury or acted improperly in any other manner. We have considered defendant’s other contentions and find them similarly lacking in merit.

"Cardona, P. J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered December 21, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of five years to life imprisonment following acceptance of his guilty plea. Defendant contends that County Court coerced his guilty plea by threatening to revoke the plea bargain offer made two months earlier unless defendant accepted it by the end of the business day and by indicating the imposition of a greater sentence after trial. The argument is not preserved for appeal inasmuch as defendant neither moved to withdraw his guilty plea nor to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Ryan, 191 AD2d 814). In any event, the record clearly indicates that defendant’s guilty plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909) and without any protest of innocence.
The offer of five years to life that encompassed two distinct class A-II felonies, as well as a separate class B felony, was made on September 4, 1992. Defendant, through counsel, rejected that offer on September 25, 1992 when he made a counteroffer to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of three years to life. When defendant appeared in court on November 16, 1992, sufficient time had elapsed for him to have considered the plea bargain. By that time, County Court had rendered a decision on defendant’s pretrial omnibus motion and scheduled the case for trial. Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to condition the proffered plea bargain on defendant’s acceptance of it before the end of business that day.
Furthermore, unlike People v Christian (139 AD2d 896, lv denied 71 NY2d 1024), the record here lacks an explicit threat to give defendant a heavier sentence if he exercised his right to trial. County Court’s statements informed defendant that consecutive sentences were legally permissible upon multiple convictions. Although defendant again expressed his general dissatisfaction with representation of his attorney at the time of the plea and stated that he had recently mailed a pro se motion seeking the assignment of new counsel, he elected not to pursue that issue. Instead, defendant accepted the plea bargain negotiated by the Public Defender’s office which substantially limited his exposure to imprisonment (see, People v Reeves, 199 AD2d 566).

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (Paño Z. Patsalos, J.), rendered June 8, 1990, convict ing him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and criminal possession of controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to concurrent indeterminate terms of 12 Vi to 25 years imprisonment for each conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and 5 to 10 years imprisonment for each conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentences on the two convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree to concurrent indeterminate terms of 8 Vi to 17 years imprisonment; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The trial commenced on May 4, 1990, a Friday. After the court recessed, a juror notified the Court Clerk that he recognized the first witness, an undercover officer, although he had not recognized the officer’s name on the list of prospective witnesses. When the trial reconvened the following Monday, the court informed the parties what had occurred and they questioned the juror in chambers. The juror told the court and the attorneys that he knew the officer from church and no longer felt he could hear the case without prejudice. However, he insisted that all he had told his fellow jurors was that he knew the officer from church, and that he had said nothing about the officer’s credibility. With the consent of the parties, the court discharged the juror and, in open court, asked the remaining assembled jurors whether, as a result of conversations with the discharged juror, anyone of them felt unable to ""listen to the testimony objectively and fairly not only for the defendant * * * but for the People as well”. The court instructed any juror with such reservations to raise his or her hand, at which point the matter would be discussed in chambers outside the presence of the other jurors. No juror responded. The defense counsel then moved for a mistrial on the ground that the discharged juror’s statements to the other jurors had contaminated the jury. The court denied the motion.
We disagree with the defendant’s contention that the court improvidently exercised its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. As the Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated, ""[bjecause juror misconduct can take many forms, no ironclad rule of decision is possible. In each case the facts must be examined to determine the nature of the material placed before the jury and the likelihood that prejudice would be engendered” (People v Brown, 48 NY2d 388, 394; see also, People v Testa, 61 NY2d 1008; People v Sullivan, 167 AD2d 564). Here, after a thorough and searching inquiry, the court properly determined that the comments made by the discharged juror to the other jurors were not likely to result in substantial prejudice. Therefore, a mistrial was not warranted (see, People v Castillo, 144 AD2d 376; People v Costello, 104 AD2d 947).
We find that the defendant’s sentence was excessive to the extent indicated.
We have considered the defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Thompson, J.

"Weiss, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered May 1, 1986, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In January 1986, defendant and a codefendant, Humberto Quitllet, were charged in a four-count indictment with the possession and sale of cocaine, a controlled substance. Pursuant to a negotiated bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged that he provided the cocaine which Quitllet sold, fully intending to share in the profits. At sentencing, defendant moved to vacate his guilty plea, contending that he had a valid entrapment defense. This application was precipitated by Quitllet’s recent acquittal at trial on the basis of entrapment. County Court denied the application without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accord with the plea bargain to an indeterminate term of 8 ló-years-to-life imprisonment.
On this appeal, defendant argues that County Court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate the plea and that the sentence was excessive. We find neither contention persuasive. A guilty plea may not generally be withdrawn absent some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in inducing the plea (see, People v Cooke, 61 AD2d 1060, 1061). Resolution of a withdrawal application rests within the trial court’s discretion (CPL 220.60 [3]; see, People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677). Although no specific reference to entrapment was made, a review of the plea minutes confirms that defendant fully discussed the ramifications of his plea with counsel (compare, People v Johnson, 91 AD2d 782, 783). Defendant’s suggestion that Quitllet’s acquittal revealed previously unknown facts supporting an entrapment defense is sharply contradicted by his specific admission of a profit motive during the plea colloquy. Given these circumstances, County Court could readily determine that defendant’s belated claim of entrapment was without substance (see, People v Austin, 117 AD2d 835, 836; People v Kelsch, supra; People v Johnson, supra).
Finally, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed, which was within the scope of the plea agreement and the pertinent statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [a]; [4] [a]).

"In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment of at least one year and no more than SVa years to be followed by a two-year period of post-release supervision. County Court released defendant to interim probation pending sentencing. While on probation, defendant and a codefendant were charged in a 12-count indictment with additional drug-related crimes. In satisfaction thereof, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and again waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of this plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to nine years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to run concurrently to the sentence imposed in connection with the first indictment of 5x/2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was sentenced accordingly and he now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. We are, however, precluded from addressing this claim given defendant’s valid waivers of appeal (see People v Harris, 84 AD3d 1587 [2011]; People v Jones, 83 AD3d 1289 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 860 [2011]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 5, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered November 10, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
In satisfaction of a 12-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to four counts without any promise regarding sentencing. County Court sentenced defendant to seven years in prison with two years of postrelease supervision on each of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, 5V2 years in prison for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and one year of incarceration for criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. The court denied defendant’s subsequent CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the order denying his motion.
County Court did not inform defendant of the key rights he was forfeiting by pleading guilty rather than proceeding to trial. The court did not advise defendant of the potential sentencing range before accepting an open plea, so as to ensure that defendant’s plea was knowing and intelligent. Notably, postrelease supervision was not mentioned by anyone during the plea proceedings. Due to these omissions during the plea colloquy, the court could not be assured that defendant had a full understanding of the plea and its consequences (see People v Thomas, 68 AD3d 1445, 1447 [2009]). “Because a defendant pleading guilty to a determinate sentence must be aware of the postrelease supervision component of that sentence in order to knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently choose among alternative courses of action, the failure of a court to advise of post-release supervision requires reversal of the conviction” (People v Catu, 4 NY3d 242, 245 [2005]). Based on the court’s failure to advise defendant of the mandatory imposition of postrelease supervision, as well as other important aspects of the plea, we reverse the judgment and vacate his plea.
Defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion is rendered academic by our reversal of the judgment.

Considering that defendant could have received a maximum of 15 years and not less than a mandatory three years upon his conviction for a class C felony, the County Court’s imposition of a five-year maximum sentence cannot be said to constitute a clear abuse of its discretion, despite defendant’s prior character and record which was fully presented to the trial court (People v Dittmar, 41 AD2d 788).

On July 24, 1994 defendant, following his arraignment on a felony complaint accusing him of, inter alia, three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was committed to the custody of the Sheriff in lieu of $500,000 bail. Thereafter, defendant and 11 others were indicted and charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree. Additionally, defendant was charged in 32 counts of that indictment with, inter alia, 26 counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony. Upon defendant’s arraignment on the indictment, defense counsel advised County Court that defendant, defense counsel and the District Attorney had signed a proffer agreement wherein the District Attorney consented to a reduction of bail to $75,000 in exchange for defendant’s cooperation in connection with the investigation leading to the instant indictment and any related investigations and, additionally, at the appropriate time, the District Attorney would give defendant consideration concerning disposition of the charges against him by reason of such cooperation.
Following the aforesaid arraignment, counsel for defendant apparently inquired of the District Attorney what his position would be regarding a plea and sentence in the event that defendant cooperated with the authorities, and counsel was advised that defendant would be permitted to plead to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with an indeterminate prison sentence of 8 to 24 years. Counsel for defendant found this position to be particularly harsh and the District Attorney, after further consideration, indicated a willingness to recommend a sentence of 7 to 21 years. Continu ing to find the District Attorney’s plea offer as unreasonable, defense counsel moved for specific performance of the ""cooperation and plea agreement”, which motion was denied. Following defendant’s plea to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and his sentence thereon of 8 to 24 years, this appeal ensued.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, there was never placed upon the record a plea agreement susceptible of specific performance (see, Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116). Defendant agreed to cooperate with the authorities in consideration of bail reduction, and the District Attorney acknowledged that he would consider such cooperation in determining his recommended disposition of the charges. The fact that defendant and his attorney did not perceive that the District Attorney gave sufficient consideration to defendant’s cooperation is of no moment, inasmuch as the District Attorney never committed to any specific and, therefore, enforceable plea agreement.

"—Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Aison, J.), rendered December 18, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and burglary in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered May 18, 1992, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his conviction, without a hearing.
Defendant pleaded guilty to burglary in the third degree and two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As a part of the plea agreement, County Court agreed to sentence defendant to concurrent prison terms of 2% to 7 years on the burglary conviction and 4 to 12 years on each of the two attempted sale convictions. Defendant also expressly agreed that County Court would be free to impose the harshest sentences, all to be served consecutively, if defendant intentionally failed to appear for sentencing. Defendant subsequently failed to appear for sentencing, allegedly because he had become intoxicated, and County Court imposed two consecutive sentences of 4 to 12 years for the attempted sale convictions and a sentence of 2Vz to 7 years for the burglary conviction, to run concurrently to the other two sentences.
Given the voluntary nature of defendant’s intoxication, we find that the record demonstrates that defendant intentionally failed to appear for sentencing. Consequently, County Court was free to enhance the sentence in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement (see, People v Bennett, 162 AD2d 825; People v Chevalier, 92 AD2d 944). Further, in light of defendant’s extensive criminal record and the facts that he was allowed to plead guilty to three crimes in satisfaction of three indictments that included a total of 16 counts and was not given the harshest sentences possible on the convictions of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, we find no basis to disturb the sentence of County Court. Finally, County Court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to set aside the sentence without a hearing. As already noted, County Court was merely exercising its right to sentence defendant pursuant to the plea agreement (see, People v Chevalier, supra).

On January 14, 1975 defendant and his brother Rafael were indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Specifically, the indictment charged that they sold four tinfoil packets containing heroin to one Anne Didrich, also known as Anne Benton (herein Anne). Rafael subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge. A severance was then granted. Defendant was tried and convicted. He received an indeterminate sentence of three years to life. Basically, it was defendant’s contention at trial that Rafael was the guilty party and defendant was not involved. To substantiate this, Rafael testified, admitting this guilt and exonerating defendant. The latter testified in his own behalf. Anne testified for the prosecution and related a contrary story which implicated defendant. The conflicting stories presented questions of fact and credibility which the jury resolved against defendant. On this appeal defendant urges several errors. We have examined all of his arguments and conclude they lack merit.

Defendant was charged in a three-count indictment with various crimes after he sold ecstasy to a police informant during a controlled buy operation. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he entered a plea of guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the indictment and purportedly waived his right to appeal. County Court denied his subsequent motion to withdraw his plea and imposed the agreed-upon sentence of 90 days in jail followed by five years of probation. Defendant now appeals, arguing that the court should have granted his motion based upon the ineffectiveness of his counsel.
Although defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument implicates the voluntariness of his guilty plea and thus survives his appeal waiver (see People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1344 [2011]; People v Fitzgerald, 56 AD3d 811, 812 [2008]), defendant’s argument in that regard is unavailing. His primary contention in support of his motion to withdraw his plea was that his counsel failed to advise him regarding the judicial di version program created by CPL article 216. We note that whether an eligible defendant will be offered judicial diversion pursuant to that article is within the trial court’s discretion (see CPL 216.05 [4]). Here, in denying defendant’s withdrawal motion, County Court stated that under the circumstances of this case it would not have exercised its discretion in defendant’s favor even if an application had been made. Inasmuch as judicial diversion would not have been available to defendant and he has produced no other “evidence of innocence, fraud or mistake in the inducement” (People v Waters, 80 AD3d 1002, 1003 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 858 [2011]; see People v Mitchell, 73 AD3d 1346, 1347 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 922 [2010]), the court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chenango County (Sullivan, J.), rendered October 14, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of robbery in the first degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to five years in prison to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision and was to waive his right to appeal. During the plea proceedings, County Court agreed to release defendant on a one-week furlough so that he could spend time with his children before sentencing, but admonished him that a condition of his release was that he not consume alcohol or drugs. When he reappeared for sentencing, it was disclosed that defendant had tested positive for THC. As a result, County Court imposed an enhanced sentence of six years in prison to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that County Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence without first conducting a hearing to determine if he, in fact, violated the conditions of his release by smoking marihuana while he was on furlough. We note that this issue has not been preserved due to defendant’s failure to object to the enhanced sentence on this basis or to move to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Wachtel, 117 AD3d 1203 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1044 [2014]; People v Bucknor, 116 AD3d 1233, 1234 [2014]). In any event, County Court afforded defendant an opportunity to respond and, given the positive test results and defendant’s admission to smoking marihuana, assured itself that the enhanced sentence was based upon reliable and accurate information (see People v Kocher, 116 AD3d 1301, 1302 [2014]; People v Paneto, 112 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2013], lv denied 23 3MY3d 1023 [2014]; People v Saucier, 69 AD3d 1125, 1126 [2010]). Defendant’s claim that he smoked marihuana while in jail does not compel a contrary conclusion under the circumstances presented here. Therefore, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered February 10, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a waiver of appeal. County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a five-year prison term, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, and recommended that defendant be considered for any substance abuse programs that the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision deemed him eligible for. After the court imposed defendant’s sentence, defendant’s counsel stated that the court was empowered to order that defendant participate in a Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program — a statement that the court construed as a motion for such an order. The court denied the motion. Defendant appeals.
Initially, the record establishes that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. County Court confirmed that defendant understood that his right to appeal was separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a guilty plea and confirmed that defendant understood that certain appeal rights, which the court enumerated, would not be foreclosed by an appeal waiver. Defendant explicitly waived his appeal rights, without qualification, during the same colloquy. Accordingly, defendant’s waiver was valid, and that waiver forecloses our review of discretionary sentencing determinations (see People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 969 [2014]; People v Wolz, 112 AD3d 1150, 1152 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1026 [2014]).
In any event, defendant’s challenge to the CASAT determination is without merit. Although County Court was initially unaware of its power to order defendant’s participation in CASAT, defendant apprised the court of its statutory authority to do so (see Penal Law § 60.04 [6]). Defendant’s contention that the court nonetheless denied defendant CASAT participation due to a mistaken belief that it did not have the power to make such an order is without specific support in the record and is therefore speculative. In addition, the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to order defendant’s participation in the CASAT program (see People v Walker, 95 AD3d 1240, 1241 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1002 [2012]; People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Traficanti, Jr., J.), rendered September 27, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
After pleading guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that this sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Not only did defendant receive the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [d]; [4] [b]), but he pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. In addition, defendant derived a benefit from pleading guilty as he was able to plead to a class D felony instead of a class B felony, which carried with it a more lenient sentence (compare, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b], with Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [d]). Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v Pardoe, 147 AD2d 820; People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered October 18, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Upon pleading guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony, defendant received a prison sentence of 15 years to life. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that the sentence should be reduced as a result of his age, his addiction to cocaine at the time and his lack of criminal history. Not only did defendant receive the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]), but 10 other felony counts and one misdemeanor count were dropped as a result of the plea agreement. In addition, defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Finally, defendant’s self-induced drug addiction does not present the type of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in his sentence (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Under the circumstances, we find no abuse by County Court in imposing sentence (see, supra; People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered February 19, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree stemming from allegations that he sold cocaine to the same individual on April 30, 1998 and May 28, 1998. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a joint sentencing recommendation of consecutive 1 to 3-year prison terms. During the plea allocution, however, defendant indicated that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the April 30, 1998 sale and could not recall whether he sold the individual one or two packets of cocaine. After further questioning defendant and advising him that his allocution raised a possible issue of criminal intent, County Court adjourned the matter to enable defendant to further discuss his options with defense counsel. Upon returning to court, defendant recited sufficient facts to establish each ánd every element of the pleaded crimes and, in response to County Court’s inquiries, indicated his understanding that by pleading guilty he was waiving any issues relating to his intoxication or criminal intent. County Court thereafter accepted defendant’s guilty plea and sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of 1 to 4 years on each conviction. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and, accordingly, his challenge to the sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review (see, People v Chappelle, 250 AD2d 878, lv denied 92 NY2d 894; People v Stockwell, 243 AD2d 992). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation doctrine is inapplicable here because, even assuming that defendant’s initial factual recitation raised a question concerning his criminal intent or the availability of an intoxication defense, County Court satisfied any duty of further inquiry by advising defendant that an issue of criminal intent may have been raised, adjourning the matter to permit further consultation with counsel and subsequently ascertaining that defendant knowingly waived the potential defense (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Pink, 265 AD2d 191, lv denied 94 NY2d 865; People v Williamson, 165 AD2d 686; cf., People v Maldonado, 254 AD2d 574). In any event, were we to review the merits, we would find that County Court properly accepted defendant’s guilty plea following the second plea allocution inasmuch as the record reveals that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Snow, 253 AD2d 985, 986, lv denied 93 NY2d 858).
Finally, defendant contends that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive in view of his young age. We disagree. County Court was not bound by the joint sentencing recommendation of defense counsel and the prosecutor (see, People v Dopp, 261 AD2d 715) and, considering defendant’s significant juvenile and adult criminal history, we discern no basis to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Shabazz, 242 AD2d 764, lv denied 91 NY2d 836).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered October 4, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony (see, Penal Law § 220.39 [1]). Following plea-bargaining negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced as indicated at the time of his plea and in accord with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 8 years. However, defendant’s maximum sentence should have been at least nine years (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]) with a minimum of one half of that (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [b]). The sentence defendant did in fact receive was therefore illegal and, by operation of law, cannot stand (see, People v Shelton, 100 AD2d 775). Since the sentence promised at the time of defendant’s plea of guilty cannot be fulfilled, thus denying defendant the benefit of the plea bargain, he is entitled to vacatur of the sentence and should be given the opportunity to move to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Shelton, supra; People v Rodriguez, 70 AD2d 509; People v Miller, 38 AD2d 745, 746).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered May 22, 1974, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He received an indeterminate sentence with a maximum term of life imprisonment and a minimum term of imprisonment of four years. On this appeal defendant raises two issues. He maintains that the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the illegal sale of methadone constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and, consequently, subdivision 2 of section 70.00 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional. Secondly, he contends that the trial court’s refusal to grant a continuance to enable defendant’s attorney to further prepare for trial was an abuse of discretion. As for the first issue, most of the arguments urged by defendant for reversal were rejected in People v Venable (37 NY2d 100, affg 46 AD2d 73). Furthermore, we are not persuaded by defendant’s additional argument that since methadone, unlike heroin, produces no euphoria or high and is less dangerous, its illegal sale should not receive the same punishment as the illegal sale of heroin. The reasons advanced by defendant to sustain his second contention also lack merit. The record demonstrates that defendant’s counsel had approximately two weeks’ notice that the trial would commence on April 15, 1974; that counsel had the desired transcript of a codefendant’s trial some three days before trial; that the testimony of the unavailable witness was admittedly cumulative and, in any event, defendant made no effort to take his testimony. From an examination of the record in its entirety, we conclude that defendant had a fair trial and we should not disturb the jury’s verdict. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered September 25, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Following defendant’s plea of guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea. County Court denied this motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant to eight years to life in accordance with the plea bargain. In our view, County Court did not abuse its discretion by denying this motion. The plea allocution minutes indicate that defendant’s plea was knowing and voluntary and there is no factual support for the contention that defendant entered the plea under duress. We are also unpersuaded by defendant’s assertion that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.

In satisfaction of a five-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 41/2 to 9 years. On appeal, he contends that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily or intelligently made because of his medical condition at the time of the plea. Initially, inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw or vacate his plea, we find that he has waived his right to challenge it on appeal (see, CPL 440.10; People v Claudio, 64 NY2d 858; People v Warren, 47 NY2d 740, 741). Nonetheless, were we to consider the merits, our review of the transcript of the plea allocution reveals that defendant was fully advised of and understood the ramifications of his guilty plea.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered March 19, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was charged in a five-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and other drug-related crimes stemming from the sale of cocaine on three occasions. He was subsequently charged in a three-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and other crimes that followed a separate sale of cocaine and his conduct in resisting arrest. County Court consolidated the indictments and denied defendant’s pretrial motions to suppress evidence. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first indictment and, under count two of the second indictment, to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, in satisfaction of that indictment, and admitted his predicate drug-related felony conviction. Consistent with the plea agreement, the court imposed concurrent prison sentences of six years with three years of postrelease supervision on each conviction. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel in that counsel failed to file an application requesting judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program pursuant to CPL 216.05. This claim is unpreserved for our review, as defendant failed to raise it before County Court and the record does not reflect that he moved to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Williams, 140 AD3d 1535, 1536 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 975 [2016]; People v Rich, 140 AD3d 1407, 1407 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 936 [2016]). In any event, “in the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1264 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). Here, defendant’s assigned counsel opposed consolidation of the indictments, pursued discovery, made appropriate pretrial motions and competently represented him during the pretrial hearings and secured a favorable plea deal. Defendant then retained new counsel, who reviewed the case history and represented him at the time of the plea. Given that defendant could have received consecutive sentences on each of the four charged drug sales (see Penal Law § 70.25; People v Dean, 8 NY3d 929, 931 [2007]), and that the maximum second felony drug offender sentence for the top count to which he pleaded guilty, a class B felony, was 12 years (see Penal Law §§ 70.70 [1] [b]; [3] [b] [i]; 220.39 [1]), defendant benefitted from a favorable plea deal. Further, judicial diversion to drug treatment is discretionary (see People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1384 [2013]) and, even assuming that he is an “[eligible defendant” (CPL 216.00 [1]), the record does not reflect any basis upon which to believe that the court would have deemed it appropriate in view of defendant’s extensive criminal history (see CPL 216.05 [3] [b] [v]; [4]; People v Pittman, 140 AD3d 989, 989 [2016]; People v Carper, 124 AD3d 1319, 1320 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 949 [2015]; compare People v Cora, 135 AD3d 987, 989 [2016]). Accordingly, were this claim properly before us, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation.
Finally, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the agreed-upon sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Woodruff, 136 AD3d 1073, 1074 [2016]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered March 15, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, defendant was to be adjudicated a youthful offender and sentenced to 105 days in jail and five years’ probation. Defendant was released into his own custody pending sentencing. County Court warned him, however, that if he was charged with other crimes before sentencing, he could be sentenced to as much as 5 to 15 years in prison.
While awaiting sentencing, defendant was arrested and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following a hearing at which police officers testified concerning the circumstances of defendant’s arrest, County Court found that enhancement of defendant’s sentence on the attempted criminal possession conviction was warranted. County Court then imposed a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the superior court information and was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years to run concurrently with the sentence imposed upon the attempted criminal possession conviction.
Defendant initially contends that County Court abused its discretion in finding that there was a legitimate basis for his arrest on the criminal sale charge which warranted the enhancement of his sentence on the attempted criminal possession conviction. We disagree. The undercover police officer who alleg edly purchased cocaine from defendant testified that two females led him to defendant after the officer provided them with $20 in marked money to purchase cocaine. The officer stated that when the women found defendant, they huddled with him and then one of them handed the officer what appeared to be cocaine. The officer left the scene and conducted a field test which confirmed that the substance was cocaine. He then radioed other officers who detained defendant and the two women. A search of defendant revealed the $20 in buy money, along with a small amount of marihuana. We conclude that the foregoing provided a legitimate basis for defendant’s arrest on the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712-713 [1993], cert denied 519 US 964 [1996]). Therefore, County Court’s enhancement of defendant’s sentence was entirely appropriate.
Furthermore, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that the enhanced sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant was fully informed during the plea proceedings that his failure to abide by the no-arrest condition would subject him to a greater sentence. In view of defendant’s disregard of this condition, coupled with the fact that the enhanced sentence was less than the statutory maximum, we find no extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Espino, 288 AD2d 688, 688-689 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J), rendered December 10, 2012, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a criminal substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In 2012, defendant was charged in two indictments with crimes related to narcotic possession and sale. Following the denial of her application requesting judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of both indictments. Defendant also waived her right to appeal all challenges other than constitutional issues or a violation of County Court’s sentencing commitment in connection with the plea. Thereafter, in accord with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of five years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court also directed defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $430, along with a 10% collection surcharge. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.
Defendant’s valid waiver of her right to appeal precludes her claim that County Court should have granted her application for judicial diversion (see People v Smith, 112 AD3d 1232, 1232 [2013] , lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]; People v Roche, 106 AD3d 1328, 1329 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered January 11, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
On March 17, 1992, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. On December 17, 1992, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years to life.
On this appeal, defendant contends that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made because his attorney neglected to advise him, as an alien, of the potential for deportation as the result of his guilty plea. We disagree. The fact that defendant was subject to deportation pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (see, 8 USC § 1251 et seg.) is a collateral consequence of his plea about which counsel was under no obligation to advise (see, People v Boodhoo, 191 AD2d 448; People v Avila, 177 AD2d 426, lv denied 79 NY2d 918). Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that counsel was even aware of defendant’s alien status at the time he entered the plea. A review of the plea allocution reveals that, in all other respects, defendant’s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made and the judgment should therefore be affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered October 8, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of 3V2 to 7 years in prison. Defendant appeals, contending that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. In light of defendant’s extensive criminal history and the fact that he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, we conclude that the sentence imposed was neither harsh nor excessive and should not be disturbed (see, People v Williams, 238 AD2d 633, lv denied 90 NY2d 866).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered November 6, 1988, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree.
Contrary to defendant’s claims, the record shows that his plea of guilty was voluntarily and knowingly made (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662) and that he received effective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137). Nevertheless, County Court did err in its sentencing of defendant. Defendant’s plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was misdescribed by all parties as a class A-II felony and his sentence to a prison term of five years to life was made on that basis. However, the crime to which he pleaded guilty is actually an A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 110.05 [1]), and a prison term of at least 15 years is mandated by statute (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3]'[a] [i]). Since the sentence was illegal, defendant was denied the benefit of his plea bargain and he is therefore entitled to vacatur of the sentence imposed and he should be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty (see, People v Dunnett, 157 AD2d 886, lv denied 76 NY2d 734; People v Beach, 152 AD2d 772).

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Tomlinson, J.), rendered October 12, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant was charged in two separate indictments with various drug-related crimes arising from his possession and sale of cocaine in the City of Schenectady, Schenectady County, in August and October 1998. In full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a waiver of his right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to two concurrent terms of 3V2 to IOV2 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
Initially, inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his argument that the plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered is not preserved for our review (see, People v Jones, 289 AD2d 871; People v Negron, 280 AD2d 780, lv denied 96 NY2d 832). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s claim, we would find it to be without merit. The transcript of the plea proceedings reveals that County Court fully informed defendant of the ramifications of pleading guilty and defendant indicated that he understood them, was not coerced into entering a plea and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Defendant gave a factual recitation which sufficiently supported his plea of guilty to the crimes charged. When defendant was given an opportunity to withdraw his plea at sentencing, he chose not to do so. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Fennell, 284 AD2d 795; People v McFadgen, 274 AD2d 830, lv denied 95 NY2d 966).
Moreover, defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is encompassed by his voluntary waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733; People v Bolden, 287 AD2d 883, lv denied 97 NY2d 654; People v Negron, supra at 781). In any event, we perceive no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion which would warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Jones, supra at 730; People v Robertson, 288 AD2d 620, lv denied 97 NY2d 760).

"Main, J.
Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Clyne, J.), entered March 8,1984, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and his conviction was affirmed by this court without opinion (105 AD2d 594). On this motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 (1) (h), defendant contends that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily but resulted from coercion and the denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel. The basis for this claim is defendant’s contention that his then assigned attorney advised him that no one had been acquitted of drug charges in Albany County, that he would receive a sentence of 25 years to life if convicted after trial, that even if acquitted, the District Attorney would seek to indict him on another drug charge, and that he had to decide immediately whether to accept a plea agreement. These facts are supported by sworn allegations, upon information and belief, by defendant’s current attorney, who further states the sources of his information and the grounds of his belief (see, CPL 440.30 [1]). Upon such a record, we are of the view that a hearing should have been held to determine the validity of these allegations (CPL 440.30 [5]; see, People v Picciotti, 4 NY2d 340).
This result is not precluded by defendant having raised a similar claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the direct appeal following his conviction. Ineffective assistant of counsel can usually be determined only after an evidentiary exploration under a CPL 440.10 motion and it is the rare occasion when such a claim can be resolved on direct appeal (see, e.g., People v Brown, 45 NY2d 852, 853-854). Under such circumstances, a rejection on direct appeal of a claim of ineffective assistance grounded on matters not appearing in the record should not prevent consideration on the merits of a later CPL 440.10 motion on similar grounds (see, e.g., People v Boans, 93 AD2d 1000), provided that the statutory requirements (CPL 440.30) are satisfied, as they are in this case.

"In satisfaction of multiple charges contained in two indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to five years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. We find this argument to be unpersuasive. The record establishes that defendant was a regular dealer of narcotic drugs and has a criminal record. In addition, defendant agreed to the sentence included in the plea agreement in order to avoid exposure to a much longer sentence if convicted after trial. Therefore, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Herring, 74 AD3d 1579, 1580 [2010]; People v Thompson, 70 AD3d 1123 [2010]).

"In connection with a plea agreement, defendant signed a 12-page document in which, among other things, he agreed to plead guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree as set forth in one count of a superior court information, and purportedly waived the right to appeal. One paragraph of the document stated that if defendant was arrested before sentencing, County Court would not be bound by the sentencing agreement and could sentence him up to the maximum permissible sentence. Prior to sentencing, defendant was arrested for possessing drugs and ultimately pleaded guilty in another court to a related charge. Based on that arrest, the court did not impose the one-year sentence included in the plea agreement for the present charge, but instead imposed an enhanced sentence of 2V2 years in prison, followed by one year of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant asserts that County Court improperly enhanced his sentence in violation of the plea agreement. Under the circumstances here, defendant’s challenge is not precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005] ). Further, although defendant did not properly preserve this issue, we choose to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action (see id.). A court may enhance an agreed-upon sentence after it is established that the defendant violated a condition of the plea agreement (see People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 812-813 [2009]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 894 [2006] , lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]). Under People v Parker (57 NY2d 136 [1982]), for a defendant to waive the right to be sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, the court must inform the defendant in some manner of the right that is at issue and the consequences of failing to abide by the conditions set by the court (id. at 141). The People contend that the one paragraph of the 12-page document constituted a sufficient Parker admonishment concerning the no-arrest condition. We disagree.
During the plea colloquy here, County Court never mentioned Parker warnings or the one paragraph in the document that imposed the no-arrest condition. In fact, the court did not discuss anything specific about the document whatsoever. The court merely asked defendant whether the document contained his signature and initials, if he had reviewed it with counsel, and if he had any questions and was willing to plead guilty in exchange for a sentencing promise. This colloquy was simply not sufficient to insure that defendant was fully aware of the adverse consequences that might flow from his being arrested prior to the imposition of sentence. This flaw in defendant’s plea allocution was not remedied by the court’s incorporation by reference of the 12-page affidavit that contained a single paragraph describing the circumstances that could lead to the imposition of an enhanced sentence (cf. People v Kinch, 15 AD3d 780, 781 [2005]; compare People v Bunce, 45 AD3d 982, 984 [2007] , lv denied 10 NY3d 809 [2008]). While written statements or affidavits may serve as a helpful supplement to a colloquy with the court concerning a plea or the waiver of certain rights, these writings cannot be substituted for on-the-record discussions between the defendant and the court. Due to the inadequacy of the Parker warnings here, we remit for County Court to either impose the agreed-upon sentence or permit defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea before imposing an enhanced sentence (see People v Armstead, 52 AD3d 966, 968 [2008] ).
We take this opportunity to condemn the practice of “plea by check off list.” A court’s constitutional responsibility to review the terms and conditions of the plea agreement, the defendant’s rights and those rights that the defendant is giving up and the concomitant responsibility to ascertain that the defendant understands them and is knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waiving them must appear “on the face of the record” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11 [1989]; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 244 [1974]). These weighty matters should not be merely relegated to a lengthy written docu ment, but must be developed in an appropriate manner on the record.

. Although defendant does not challenge the plea itself, given the utter lack of substance during the colloquy, it was insufficient to adequately constitute a knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea or waiver of appeal.
. We note that defendant initialed conflicting paragraphs indicating both that he could and could not read the English language.

"Garry, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered April 13, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a superior court information, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. While County Court agreed to sentence defendant to probation, defendant was warned that a prison term of up to lx/2 years could be imposed if he continued to use illicit substances such as marihuana, failed to comply with supervised release requirements or did not appear for sentencing. Defendant failed to abide by those conditions by, among other things, using marihuana, and County Court accordingly sentenced him to a jail term of one year. Upon defendant’s appeal, we affirm.
As an initial matter, County Court separately explained the rights encompassed by an appeal waiver during the plea colloquy, and defendant thereafter stated that he was freely waiving his right to appeal and executed a detailed written waiver in which he affirmed his understanding of the waiver and indicated that he had ample time to discuss the matter with counsel. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that defendant’s appeal waiver was a knowing, intelligent and voluntary one (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1231-1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]).
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea— unlike his argument regarding the factual sufficiency of that plea—survives that waiver, but is unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d 987, 987 [2010]; People v Empey, 73 AD3d at 1388). Moreover, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that negated an element of the crime or otherwise called his guilt into question, this case does not fall within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Phelan, 77 AD3d at 987; People v Clinton, 22 AD3d 887, 887-888 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 811 [2006]).
Next, County Court was free to impose an enhanced sentence without offering defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea, as he was warned at the time of his guilty plea that County Court “could impose a different sentence if [he] failed to meet specified conditions” and admittedly violated such a condition by using marihuana (People v Wilson, 69 AD3d 970, 971 [2010]; see People v Figgins, 87 NY2d 840, 841 [1995]; People v Holmes, 67 AD3d 1069, 1071 [2009]). Defendant’s remaining argument that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver, as he was advised of the maximum sentence that could be imposed if he violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 813 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered May 10, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty before County Court (Schneer, J.) to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 3 Vs years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. County Court (Williams, J.) thereafter reviewed defendant’s presentence investigation report and declined to impose the agreed-upon sentence. Following several conferences, during which defendant declined to withdraw his plea despite County Court’s stated intention to impose an enhanced sentence of eight years in prison for the weapon charge, the court sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of JVs years followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant did not preserve his challenge to the imposition of an enhanced sentence by making a postconviction motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction. Nonetheless, “[wjhere a court determines that the negotiated sentence is not appropriate, it may impose an enhanced sentence if it first offers the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea” (People v Sanchez, 87 AD3d 1226, 1226 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 928 [2012]; see People v Lindsey, 80 AD3d 1005, 1006 [2011]). We find that the record in this case establishes that County Court fulfilled its obligation to provide defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea prior to imposing an enhanced sentence and defendant opted not to do so. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the court’s imposition of an enhanced sentence (see People v Johnson, 97 AD3d 990, 991 [2012]). Nor are we persuaded that there are any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Sanchez, 87 AD3d at 1226-1227).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered June 25, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with multiple drug crimes following the seizure of various controlled substances and drug paraphernalia from the motel room where he was staying. At the conclusion of a combined Mapp/Dunaway hearing, County Court denied defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence seized. Thereafter, pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court sentenced him to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, challenging the denial of his suppression motion.
Notably, defendant does not attack the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal, and the record confirms that it was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. During the plea colloquy, County Court fully informed defendant of the separate and distinct right that was being waived and the consequences thereof, and addressed it separately from those rights being forfeited upon defendant’s guilty plea. Defendant confirmed his understanding that he was giving up his right to appeal from all aspects of the case, including everything that had already occurred, and counsel fully joined in the waiver. In light of defendant’s valid appeal waiver, he is foreclosed from now challenging County Court’s ruling on his suppression motion (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Muirhead, 67 AD3d 1258, 1259 [2009]; People v Schmidt, 57 AD3d 1104 [2008]; People v Martin, 16 AD3d 767, 767-768 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered July 13, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of five counts of the crime of possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child.
During a search of defendant’s home following his arrest on an unrelated crime, the police discovered five magazines containing child pornography. Defendant was ultimately acquitted of the charge on which he was initially arrested and he thereafter entered a plea of guilty of five counts of possessing an obscene performance by a child. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of lVs to 4 years in prison, and a fine of $10,000 was also imposed.
On appeal, defendant’s attorney contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced. Defendant pro se contends that the conviction should be reversed. We find no merit to defendant’s pro se arguments, but we agree that the sentence should be reduced.
County Court found that defendant had accepted responsibility for possessing the pornographic material and after noting that the possession of the material is deserving of serious punishment to deter defendant and others from similar crimes, the court explained its sentencing rationale as follows: “The Court takes note of the favorable [presentence] report as well as numerous letters written on behalf of defendant. The Court takes further note of the circumstances in which the contraband was seized and notes that the contraband was, indeed, 20 some years old. But that, in my opinion, only goes to whether or not the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive and not to the fact that the defendant is deserving of a significant sentence. The very possession of this contraband, as the Legislature has decided, is so offensive, so heinous as to require this Court, in my opinion, to sentence [defendant to a prison term of lVs to 4 years on each count].”
The crimes at issue are class E felonies (see, Penal Law § 263.11) and there were a number of authorized dispositions (see, Penal Law § 60.01), including an indeterminate sentence, with a maximum not exceeding four years and a minimum not exceeding one third of the maximum (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [e]; [3] [b]), or an alternative definite sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [4]). In this case, County Court seemingly viewed the statutory scheme as requiring the imposition of a sentence of lVs to 4 years, while the Penal Law clearly establishes lVs to 4 years as the harshest possible sentence if the court decides to impose an indeterminate sentence. County Court compounded the error by limiting its consideration of relevant sentencing factors to the question of whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences. Those factors should have been considered not only on the issue of the appropriate indeterminate term for each count, but also on the question of whether this was an appropriate case for an alternative definite sentence pursuant to Penal Law § 70.00 (4). By imposing the harshest possible indeterminate term for each count as though that were the sentence required by law, County Court failed to exercise the sentencing discretion granted by Penal Law § 70.00.
In these circumstances, and considering defendant’s age, disability, lack of a recent criminal record and acceptance of responsibility for his crimes, together with the circumstances surrounding his possession of the material and the recommendation of the presentence report, we exercise our discretion to reduce the concurrent sentences to time served on each count (see, People v Smith, 222 AD2d 738). We are also of the view that the fine should be reduced to $2,000.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Meyer, J.), rendered March 25, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of three pending indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, the People and defendant both recommended that defendant be sentenced to a prison term of seven years and postrelease supervision of between one and two years. County Court deemed the recommended sentence to be inappropriate and sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of 10 years and postrelease supervision of three years. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Defendant argues that no information properly before County Court justified its failure to impose the recommended sentence. County Court was not obligated to follow that recommendation, as it advised defendant of both its authority to render a different sentence and the maximum prison sentence that was permissible (see People v Watson, 61 AD3d 1217, 1219 [2009]; People v Rawdon, 296 AD2d 599, 599 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 771 [2002]). Accordingly, defendant’s argument amounts to a challenge to the procedures used by the court in determining his sentence and is precluded by his appeal waiver (see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 281 [1992]; People v Hicks, 201 AD2d 831, 832 [1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 911 [1994]; cf. People v Gordon, 53 AD3d 793, 794 [2008]).
Finally, defendant’s appeal waiver also precludes our review of his challenge to the sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Bunce, 45 AD3d 982, 985 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 809 [2008]; People v Perry, 2 AD3d 1153, 1153 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 744 [2004]).

In appealing her conviction for third degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, defendant argues only that her 3-to 9-year prison sentence was harsh and excessive. However, the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]) and was in accordance with the plea agreement. In addition, the plea was in full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered April 27, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
The record indicates that defendant arranged, while incarcerated, to sell a quantity of heroin to an undercover agent through a surrogate. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a two-count superior court information. In accepting the plea, County Court made no commitment as to the sentence to be imposed. The court ultimately sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years, to be served consecutively to the sentence he was currently serving. Defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that this sentence was harsh and excessive because, inter alia, the District Attorney recommended a lesser sentence.
Notably, where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it shall not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685). Here, although defendant received the harshest permissible sentence, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court. Furthermore, upon review of the record, which reflects that defendant has four prior drug-related convictions, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed in the interest of justice (see, id.).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered September 20, 2005, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging her with criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree and alleging that she presented two forged prescriptions for Vicodin at a pharmacy. Pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty as charged and agreed to enter a drug treatment program which, among other things, prohibited her unauthorized use or possession of drugs. Defendant was informed at this time that noncompliance with the program could lead to sanctions, including termination from the program and a sentence of up to 2⅓ to 7 years in prison, and she was thereafter sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge. After defendant was found with a large amount of prescription drugs in her possession and admitted to a relapse, County Court summarily revoked her conditional discharge and resentenced her to 2 to 6 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, inasmuch as defendant did not contest County Court’s finding that she violated the conditional discharge and was afforded the opportunity to be heard on the violation, no formal hearing was required before her conditional discharge was revoked (see CPL 410.70 [1]; People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]). Moreover, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s claim that her sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record characterized by drug and alcohol-related offenses and has been provided numerous opportunities to address her addiction. Considering that defendant failed to meet the conditions she accepted in connection with her voluntary, knowing and intelligent guilty plea, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of her sentence (see People v Garner, 28 AD3d 875, 875 [2006]; People v Johnson, 12 AD3d 727, 727-728 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 745 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 4, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Although defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not in and of itself preclude appellate review of the voluntariness of his plea (see, People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982), the issue was not preserved by a motion to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Beekman, 280 AD2d 784, lv denied 96 NY2d 780). By failing to make the appropriate motion, defendant deprived County Court of the opportunity to address the alleged deficiency and, if necessary, take corrective action (see, People v Tumminia, 272 AD2d 634, lv denied 95 NY2d 939). In any event, defendant’s claim that his plea is the product of confusion and coercion has no support in the record.
Defendant’s claim that the 4 to 15-year sentence is harsh and excessive is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733) and lacks merit in any event. Considering the nature of the crimes, the fact that the sentence was within the statutory guidelines and the substantial measure of leniency accorded defendant by the imposition of concurrent sentences for crimes that arose out of separate and distinct criminal transactions, we conclude that County Court did not abuse its discretion and there are no extraordinary circumstances which would warrant the exercise of our authority to modify the sentence in the interest of justice.

"Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Orange County (Rosenwasser, J.), both rendered December 16, 2004, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 04-00575, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence, and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the second degree under indictment No. 04-00594, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him, inter alia, to an indeterminate term of 6 to 18 years imprisonment for conspiracy in the second degree under indictment No. 04-00594.
Ordered that the judgment under indictment No. 04-00575 is affirmed; and it is further,
Ordered that the judgment under indictment No. 04-00594 is modified, on the law and as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence imposed on the conviction of conspiracy in the second degree from an indeterminate term of 6 to 18 years imprisonment to an indeterminate term of 4 to 12 years imprisonment; as so modified, the judgment under indictment No. 04-00594 is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that he was deprived of due process by the failure of the interpreter to file an oath of public office and be sworn to interpret truthfully and accurately is based partially on a matter dehors the record which cannot be reviewed on direct appeal (cf. People v Dallas, 31 AD3d 573 [2006]). To the extent that the contention can be reviewed, it is without merit (see People v Bicet, 180 AD2d 692, 693 [1992]; People v Torres, 96 AD2d 604 [1983]).
The defendant’s contention that his pleas of guilty were coerced by the prosecution’s promise of leniency for his wife is unpreserved for appellate review, since he did not move to withdraw his pleas on that basis, or otherwise raise this issue before the court of first instance (see People v Clarke, 93 NY2d 904, 906 [1999]; People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]; People v Coles, 240 AD2d 419 [1997]). In any event, the record belies the defendant’s claim of coercion. During the plea allocution, the defendant acknowledged, inter alia, that he was pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty, that no one forced, threatened, coerced, or pressured him to plead guilty, and that he was pleading guilty of his own free will.
The defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to advise him of the potential immigration consequences of his plea is dehors the record and not properly before this Court.
We agree with the defendant that the sentencing court erred in imposing a sentence on his conviction of conspiracy in the second degree which was greater than the sentence promised at the plea proceeding (see People v Pagan, 245 AD2d 533 [1997]; People v Jones, 168 AD2d 471 [1990]; People v Outlaw, 157 AD2d 677 [1990]).

"Devine, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Koweek, J.), rendered June 24, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (nine counts) and resisting arrest, and the violation of unlawful possession of marihuana.
Defendant was charged, in three indictments, with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (nine counts), resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marihuana. Following an unsuccessful suppression motion, he pleaded guilty as charged and waived his right to appeal. He did so upon the understanding that his guilty plea would satisfy other pending charges and that, regardless of the outcome of a dispute as to whether his prior conviction for a federal drug offense rendered him a second felony offender, there would be a joint recommendation to sentence him to no more than 7V2 years in prison and a period of postrelease supervision. Defendant acknowledged at sentencing that he had previously been convicted of a predicate felony, and County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we find that defendant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal. Defendant executed a written plea agreement for each indictment that explained his right to appeal and waived it aside from a challenge to “the sentence . . . should it be harsher than the sentence that the District Attorney and [defendant] negotiated and jointly recommended.” During the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged that he had read those documents and had sufficient time to discuss them with defense counsel. County Court then “adequately described [the right to appeal] without lumping it into the panoply of rights normally forfeited upon a guilty plea” and confirmed that defendant understood his decision to waive it except as described in the written plea agreements (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 341 [2015]). The record accordingly establishes that defendant’s appeal waivers were valid (see id.; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; People v Toledo, 144 AD3d 1332, 1332-1333 [2016], lv denied 29 NY3d 1001 [Apr. 6, 2017]). The valid appeal waivers, in turn, preclude his challenges to the denial of his suppression motion (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d at 342; People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]) and the severity of his sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255).
Defendant’s further attack upon the procedures employed to determine his predicate felony status survives his appeal waivers (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]), but is unpreserved due to his failure to object to that procedure before County Court (see People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]; People v Gathers, 106 AD3d 1333, 1333-1334 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1073 [2013]). In any event, defendant pleaded guilty knowing full well that the question of whether he would be sentenced as a second felony offender remained unresolved. The People did not file a predicate felony statement in a timely manner, but did hand one up at sentencing stating that defendant had previously been convicted of a federal drug offense constituting a felony under New York law (see CPL 400.21 [2]). Defense counsel then stated on the record that he had advised defendant that the federal conviction amounted to a prior felony conviction and that there was “nothing to challenge,” at which point defendant admitted under oath that the allegations in the statement were accurate. Under these circumstances, “[t]he People’s failure to file a predicate statement [until after sentencing] was harmless, and remanding for filing and resentencing would be futile and pointless” (People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 20 [1983]; People v Gathers, 106 AD3d at 1334; People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]).
As a final matter, a few of our prior cases have noted that “substantial compliance” with CPL 400.21 is sufficient to uphold sentencing a defendant as a second felony offender (People v Pierre, 8 AD3d 904, 906 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 710 [2004]), but that a “complete failure” to file a predicate statement will “render [ ] the sentence invalid as a matter of law” (id. at 907; see People v De Fayette, 16 AD3d 708, 710 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Our reading of those cases is that they stand for the proposition that a significant failure to comply with the procedures of CPL 400.21, absent circumstances showing the error to be harmless, will be fatal to the ensuing sentence (see e.g. People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d at 1142; People v Harris, 61 NY2d at 20). We do not read them as hold ing that the failure to timely file a predicate statement is inexorably fatal to the validity of the ensuing sentence and, to the extent that reading is possible, we do not countenance it.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered February 13, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Following his plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7% years to life. This term and defendant’s plea to the lesser charge had been negotiated following a trial on the original charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which trial resulted in a hung jury.
On his appeal, defendant contends (1) that the testimony of an accomplice offered before the Grand Jury was uncorroborated and that the District Attorney failed to instruct the Grand Jury, in violation of CPL 190.65 (1), that corroboration of such testimony was required, and (2) that proof of uncharged crimes and hearsay evidence to demonstrate conspiratorial conduct on defendant’s part was impermissibly presented to the Grand Jury. These two errors in the presentation of the case, defendant argues, infected the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding to the extent of requiring dismissal of the indictment, notwithstanding defendant’s guilty plea.
We disagree. The evidence before the Grand Jury was legally sufficient to support the indictment. The Grand Jury heard not only the testimony of the accomplice, Willie Sims, who turned police informant, as to the details of the drug sale transaction, it also heard the tape recording of a conversation between Sims and defendant in which defendant admitted knowing about the drug deal, and defendant’s admission to a police officer as well as defendant’s reference on the tapes to himself. Thus, the evidence before the Grand Jury, unexplained and uncontradicted, was legally sufficient to demonstrate all the elements of the crimes charged and defendant’s connection with these crimes. The District Attorney’s failure to instruct the Grand Jury about corroboration, that in any event was legally sufficient (see, CPL 170.10 [1]), does not rise to the level of a constitutional error or adversely affect the integrity of the Grand Jury fact-finding process (see, People v Philipp, 106 AD2d 681, 683; People v Rex, 83 AD2d 753, 754). Where, as here, the legal evidence is sufficient, the integrity of the process is not adversely affected and the claimed error does not rise to a constitutional dimension, defendant’s plea of guilty bars the raising of the issue on appeal (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 7).
Defendant further argues that the District Attorney erred before the Grand Jury when she responded to a juror’s question of whether the offense of a criminal sale must be found by that body before it could consider a claim of conspiracy. Although we agree that the District Attorney’s answer was not accurate, the effect did not prejudice defendant. The error simply imposed a greater burden on the prosecution than was necessary. We note that contrary to the additional claim of defendant, the evidence before the Grand Jury was sufficient to establish jurisdiction in Broome County. Based on the foregoing analysis, we affirm defendant’s judgment of conviction.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered November 17, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant, who was represented by retained counsel, entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment charging him and a codefendant with various drug-related crimes. In accordance with the plea, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to six years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Defense counsel was assigned to represent defendant on appeal and she seeks to be relieved of her assignment on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant disagrees, claiming in his pro se submission that the search of his vehicle was illegal and that his retained counsel’s failure to raise this issue in County Court deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. However, the record belies such claim and clearly indicates that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal four days after County Court denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal stop and search of the vehicle that he was driving. Accordingly, defendant may not now challenge the legality of the search (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833; People v Collier, 232 AD2d 878, 878, lv denied 89 NY2d 863) nor the effectiveness of his counsel (see People v McGuffie, 294 AD2d 617, 618, lv denied 98 NY2d 699; People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643, lv denied 98 NY2d 681).

"from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Nichols, J.), rendered October 9, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
The facts of this case are fully set forth in our prior decision in which we granted the application of then appellate counsel to be relieved of his assignment and appointed new counsel to represent defendant on this appeal (60 AD3d 1150 [2009]). We must now address whether the sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive. The record discloses that defendant received a sentence of five years in prison upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and three years in prison upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, to run concurrently, and to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This was significantly less than the maximum term that could have been imposed and, notably, the plea agreement did not include a commitment by the court with respect to sentencing. In view of this, and given the quantity of heroin confiscated by the police, we find no abuse of discretion nor the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Rivera, 24 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered October 29, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a multiple-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, executed a written waiver of the right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon prison term of 4I/s to 82/s years. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and, therefore, his challenge to his sentence is preserved. Assuming arguendo, that the colloquy between defendant and County Court was insufficient to establish a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal, we, nevertheless, find that the sentence was neither harsh nor excessive. In that regard, we note that defendant was accorded a significant measure of leniency when County Court accepted his plea to a single reduced charge in satisfaction of a number of serious charges pending against him. In addition to being a second felony offender, defendant was on probation when he committed the instant crime, had prior misdemeanor drug convictions, and failed to complete drug treatment programs provided for him. Given these circumstances and the fact that the sentence was within statutory guidelines, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances which would warrant reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Clark, 263 AD2d 551, lv denied 93 NY2d 1016).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered February 19, 1998, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count each of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 3V2 to 7 years in prison for the weapon charge and one year in prison for the drug charge. Defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that his sentence was harsh and excessive, a contention we cannot endorse. Notably, a sentence within permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of sentencing discretion exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872; People v Parson, 209 AD2d 882, 884, lv denied 84 NY2d 1014). Here, the sentence imposed was authorized and, given defendant’s history and the details in the record, we find no reason to disturb the sentence in the interest of justice. Furthermore, contrary to defendant’s argument, the fact that the sentence imposed after trial was longer than that offered to defendant in a proposed pretrial plea bargain agreement did not establish that the sentence was imposed in retaliation for exercising his right to trial (see, People v Morgan, 253 AD2d 946, lv denied 92 NY2d 950).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered December 23, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a 10-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a term of 3 to 9 years in prison. His counsel seeks to be relieved of further representing defendant on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues which could be raised on appeal. Having reviewed the record and defense counsel’s brief, we agree and find that defense counsel should be relieved of his assignment. In addition, we have considered defendant’s pro se supplemental brief and reject his claim that County Court abused its discretion in imposing upon him the sentence he agreed to as part of his plea bargain.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered August 10, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On this appeal the only issue defendant argues is the excessiveness of his sentence. As a second felony offender, defendant received the most lenient allowable sentence of 4!á to 9 years for a class B felony (see, Penal Law § 70.06). Because of his prior felony conviction, defendant’s sentence must run consecutively with the unexpired portion of the prior term (Penal Law § 70.25 [2-b]). As the recipient of the most lenient allowable prison term, defendant can hardly claim that the sentencing court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence that was too severe. Furthermore, defendant’s plea bargain was favorable. He could have received as much as 12 Vi to 25 years on each of the three counts of the indictment if he had been convicted after trial, with all sentences to run consecutively. The sentence imposed on defendant’s conviction is appropriate in the circumstances and the judgment should be affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Essex County (Meyer, J.), rendered February 20, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In satisfaction of multiple indictments and other charges, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. The People and defendant jointly recommended that he be sentenced to a prison term of 12 years to be followed by post-release supervision of five years, and the People further agreed not to request that he be sentenced as a persistent felony offender. County Court imposed the recommended sentence, and defendant now appeals.
Defendant claims that County Court improperly sentenced him as a second felony drug offender, and we agree. Initially, this argument implicates the legality of his sentence and, as such, survives his appeal waiver (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1351-1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]; People v Mosley, 54 AD3d 1098, 1099 [2008]). The record does not reflect that the People filed a predicate felony statement prior to sentencing (see CPL 400.21 [2]; Penal Law § 70.71 [4] [b]), and they concede that defendant did not have “an opportunity to be heard with respect to . . . predicate sentencing” (People v Anthony, 52 AD3d 864, 865 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 733 [2008]). Indeed, defendant was not advised during the plea proceedings or thereafter that he was to be sentenced as a second felony drug offender, and County Court did not explicitly find him to be such an offender or sentence him as such (see CPL 400.21 [4]). As the provisions of CPL 400.21 were not substantially complied with, remittal is required so that defendant may be afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding his prior convictions prior to resentencing (see People v Farrow, 69 AD3d 980, 981 [2010]; People v Anthony, 52 AD3d at 865; People v Fields, 92 AD2d 749 [1983]).
Defendant’s assertion that his guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered given County Court’s failure to correctly advise him of the maximum term of imprisonment he faced is unpreserved due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mayers, 74 NY2d 931, 932 [1989]; People v Campbell, 66 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2009]), and “we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice” (People v Anthony, 52 AD3d at 865; cf.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (Wexner, J.), rendered April 29, 1991, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to concurrent indeterminate terms of 4 to 12 years imprisonment on each count. The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant’s omnibus motion which was to suppress physical evidence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the term of imprisonment on each count to concurrent indeterminate terms of 1 to 3 years imprisonment; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
We find no merit to the defendant’s contention that the ""buy money” found in his possession should have been suppressed on the ground that he was arrested without probable cause. When an arresting officer has acted on the basis of a radio bulletin from a fellow officer who has personal knowledge of the facts transmitted, the reliability of the information conveyed may be presumed, and the People are not required to call the undercover officer to testify at the suppression hearing in order to discharge their burden of coming forward with evidence to establish probable cause (see, People v Petra lia, 62 NY2d 47, 51, cert denied 469 US 852; People v Acevedo, 179 AD2d 465; People v Arango, 175 AD2d 840). Based on the facts adduced at the suppression hearing, we find that the People established probable cause for the arrest of the defendant. Therefore, the recovery and admissibility of the ""buy money” was based on a search incident to a lawful arrest.
Equally without merit is the defendant’s claim that the indictment should be dismissed as a result of the delay of over nine months after the jury verdict in imposing sentence. It is well settled that a defendant is entitled to be promptly sentenced after conviction; entry of judgment may not be indefinitely deferred or postponed (see, CPL 380.30 [1]; People v Drake, 61 NY2d 359, 364). Where the delay is both protracted and unexplained, the courts will generally find it unreasonable (see, People v Drake, supra, at 365; People ex rel. Harty v Fay, 10 NY2d 374). If, however, the delay is found to have been caused by the defendant, it should not be attributed to the State and therefore, will be found excusable (see, e.g., Matter of Weinstein v Haft, 60 NY2d 625; People v Brazeau, 144 AD2d 977, 978). The majority of the delay was caused by the defendant’s requests for adjournments and hearings regarding his motions. Therefore, we find that the delay in sentencing was not unreasonable.
However, under the circumstances of this case, we modify the sentence imposed, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the term of imprisonment to concurrent indeterminate sentences of 1 to 3 years imprisonment.
We have examined the defendant’s remaining contentions and find that they do not warrant reversal of the judgment. Lawrence, J. P., Eiber, O’Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur.

"Stein, J.
Defendant was charged in two indictments with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In October 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of both indictments and executed a written waiver of appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court then sentenced defendant to three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision and further ordered him to pay $200 in restitution. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s primary contention on this appeal — which would survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]) — is that his plea was involuntary based upon the failure of County Court and his trial counsel to advise him. on the record of the immigration consequences of his conviction. It is now established that the failure of counsel to advise a defendant of the possibility of deportation as a result of his or her plea constitutes the ineffective assistance of counsel (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US —, —, 130 S Ct 1473, 1486 [2010]). Nonetheless, inasmuch as defendant limits his argument to the failure of the court and his attorney to advise him on the record of potential immigration consequences, Padilla does not specify that attorneys must do so (id. at 1486). Moreover, while defendant correctly asserts that CPL 220.50 (7) requires the court to advise a defendant on the record, before accepting a plea of guilty, that such plea might result in deportation, the statute explicitly provides that the failure to so advise a defendant does not affect the voluntariness of the plea or the validity of the conviction (see CPL 220.50 [7]).
Defendant’s challenge to the amount of restitution he was directed to pay also survives even a valid waiver of appeal where, as here, “the plea agreement did not specify the amount of restitution to be awarded” (People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; see People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]). In the instant matter, defendant agreed to pay restitution at the time of his plea allocution, but did not agree to a specific amount, nor was the method of determining the amount discussed. The presentence investigation report prepared by the Probation Department contains a victim impact statement from the Clinton County District Attorney/Adirondack Drug Task Force seeking recovery of $200 for two controlled buys ($100 each) on the same date. At the sentencing hearing, defendant objected to the $200 total because he had been charged with only one criminal sale of a controlled substance count. He therefore argued that he should only be required to pay restitution of $100.
Defendant never contested the accuracy of the claimed expenditure of $100 per controlled buy and never requested that County Court conduct a hearing, despite being advised by the court that he was entitled to such a hearing. Inasmuch as the only issue raised by defendant regarding restitution was a purely legal one, a hearing was not required (compare People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 145-146 [1996]; People v Stevens, 80 AD3d 791, 792-793 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 900 [2011]). Similarly, because defendant never challenged the accuracy of the restitution amount sought, we reject his contention — raised for the first time on appeal — that the law enforcement agency’s failure to submit an affidavit supporting its restitution request pursuant to Penal Law § 60.27 (9) requires that the award be vacated (see People v Perez, 203 AD2d 665, 667 [1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 970 [1994]). Under these circumstances, we discern no abuse of County Court’s discretion in ordering restitution without a hearing (see generally People v Periard, 15 AD3d 693, 694 [2005]).
As to the merits of the award, a trial court “may require restitution or reparation as part of the sentence imposed upon a person convicted of an offense” (Penal Law § 60.27 [1]). An offense is defined as including “the offense for which a defendant was convicted, as well as any other offense that is part of the same criminal transaction or that is contained in any other accusatory instrument disposed of by any plea of guilty by the defendant to an offense” (Penal Law § 60.27 [4] [a]). Specifically, a defendant convicted of a “felony involving the sale of a controlled substance” may be ordered to repay a law enforcement agency “the amount of funds expended in the actual purchase” of a controlled substance (Penal Law § 60.27 [9]). Here, even though defendant was charged with only one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance, the two controlled buys in question were part of the same criminal transaction and were related to the possession charges in the indictment. Thus, County Court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution for the buy money used in both controlled buys (see People v Perez, 203 AD2d at 667). On the other hand, County Court may not impose a surcharge when restitution is to be paid to a law enforcement agency (see Penal Law § 60.27 [9]). Thus, the 10% surcharge imposed here must be vacated (see People v Williams, 272 AD2d 990 [2000]; People v Perez, 203 AD2d at 667).
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Sheridan, J.), rendered January 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial (CPL 30.20). In such cases no one factor is determinative and the court must take into consideration and balance all factors as set forth in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442). The record supports County Court’s conclusion that the only delay chargeable to the People was the date between arrest and arraignment. The remainder of the 18-month delay was occasioned by motion practice, preliminary proceedings and a trial on other charges, calendar congestion, defendant’s request for new counsel and plea bargaining (see, People v Whelan, 198 AD2d 668, lv denied 83 NY2d 812).

"Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), rendered December 9, 2005 in Albany County, among other things, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was present with a codefendant during a police undercover buy operation in which a quantity of cocaine was recovered. As a result, defendant was charged with various crimes, and eventually pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to waive his right to appeal, cooperate with the prosecution by testifying against his codefendant and, in return, receive a sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years in prison. Before concluding the plea proceedings, Supreme Court advised defendant that the agreed-upon sentence would only be honored if defendant appeared at sentencing and did not commit another crime before that time. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, the court sentenced him in absentia to 42/s to 14 years in prison. A bench warrant was issued for defendant’s arrest and, more than five years later, he appeared before the court. At that time, the court denied defendant’s request to be resentenced to a lesser sentence and imposed the original sentence. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole argument is that the 42/3-to-14-year prison sentence imposed upon him in absentia is harsh and excessive. Preliminarily, we note that defendant is not precluded from raising this challenge by the waiver of appeal inasmuch as the record does not disclose that he understood “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Lee, 51 AD3d 1217, 1217 [2008]; People v Newcomb, 45 AD3d 890, 891 [2007]; compare People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 671 [2007]). Consequently, we may consider the merits of defendant’s claim and whether the circumstances warrant the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction in reducing the sentence (see CPL 470.15 [3] [c]; [6] [b]).
In support of his argument that the sentence should be reduced, defendant points to the successful business endeavors, family stability and spiritual development he has attained over the course of the past five years which have made him a productive member of society. While this may be true, these accomplishments were made after defendant had breached his plea agreement and while he was a fugitive from justice. At the time of entering his plea, defendant was well aware of the consequences of failing to appear for sentencing as Supreme Court specifically informed him that he could be sentenced to up to 5 to 15 years in prison. In view of the foregoing, and considering defendant’s fairly extensive criminal record as well as the fact that he was not a youth at the time of the subject crime, we discern neither an abuse of discretion nor the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Shaw, 51 AD3d 1062 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 964 [2008]; People v Favor, 49 AD3d 915, 916 [2008]).

"Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, waiving his right to appeal, and was sentenced to a prison term of five years to life. The sole issue raised on this appeal is whether the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive and should, accordingly, be modified by this Court.
As defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea, this issue has not been preserved for our review (see People v Jimenez, 267 AD2d 615, 616, Iv denied 94 NY2d 921). Were we to reach it, however, we would find no evidence that it represents an abuse of judicial discretion nor are there any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Mares, 256 AD2d 716, 717, Iv denied 93 NY2d 927). The record discloses that defendant was suspected as a major drug dealer in Sullivan County, which led to his investigation and arrest by officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency. At the time of his arrest, defendant was in possession of a substantial quantity of drugs, including four pounds of marihuana and 600 tablets of the drug known as ecstasy, which he had admittedly obtained in New York City for resale upstate. Defendant argues that his previously clean criminal record warrants a reduction in sentence; however, given the gravity of the offense of which defendant stands convicted and his undisputed guilt thereof, the sentence will not be disturbed (see People v Etheridge, 233 AD2d 626, Iv denied 89 NY2d 921).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered July 23, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Resolving a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to 4V2 years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and, initially, we note that defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal, as explained by County Court during the plea colloquy, does not bar his claims herein. Nevertheless, his arguments provide no basis for reversal.
Defendant’s assertion that his plea was involuntarily entered is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to advance, in a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, the particular arguments now made before us (see People v Perry, 50 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 963 [2008]). Moreover, nothing in the plea colloquy negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Sinclair, 48 AD3d 974, 975 [2008]). Defendant’s allegation that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is also unavailing. Defense counsel negotiated a favorable plea which reduced defendant’s prison exposure, nothing in the record cast doubt on counsel’s apparent effectiveness and, during the plea colloquy, defendant indicated that he was satisfied with the legal services provided to him (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Lahon, 17 AD3d 778, 779-780 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 790 [2005]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Starkey, J.), rendered December 1, 1989, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in December 1988 with the understanding that he would be released from custody in order to cooperate with the District Attorney’s office in certain investigations. A written cooperation agreement between the District Attorney and the defendant, which was incorporated into the plea agreement, gave the District Attorney sole discretion to determine whether the defendant’s cooperation was ""meaningful and substantial”. The plea agreement further provided that if the defendant cooperated, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and plead to a lesser charge. If he absconded, the District Attorney would recommend imposition of the maximum sentence for the B felony. Sentencing was adjourned for 60 days, and, when the defendant failed to appear on that date, a bench warrant was issued. He was arrested several months later in Connecticut. At his sentencing in December 1989 the defendant moved to withdraw his plea based on allegations that he was innocent and that the People failed to fulfill certain promises which had induced him to plead guilty.
We find that the court properly declined to vacate the defendant’s plea based on his unsubstantiated claim of innocence (see, People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55; People v Ochoa, 179 AD2d 689). The record of the plea allocution establishes that the defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty with the advice of counsel and without any protestations of innocence. His belated claim of innocence was supported solely by the affirmation of his attorney and was contradicted by the affirmation of the Assistant District Attorney who signed the cooperation agreement. The court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on the defendant’s motion as he was afforded a reasonable opportunity to advance his contentions (see, People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520; People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926).
Moreover, the court properly rejected the defendant’s contention that the plea should be vacated because he was induced to plead guilty by certain off-the-record promises (see, Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116; People v Frederick, supra; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). During the plea allocution, the prosecutor placed the terms of the plea agreement on the record. Thereafter, the defendant, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel responded negatively when the court asked if any other promises had been made. Since the alleged promises did not appear on the record, the court was not required to hold a hearing to determine if such promises did exist (see, Matter of Benjamin S., supra).
Under the circumstances, we find that the sentence imposed was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).
The defendant’s remaining contentions are without merit. Lawrence, J. P., Eiber, O’Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur.",,532,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered February 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Upon pleading guilty to the reduced crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of one indictment and the dismissal of another indictment, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 to 6 years. Initially, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a $10,000 fine authorized by Penal Law § 80.00 (1) (c) (iv). There is no evidence that the court did not consider the various factors noted in the statute. In addition, under the circumstances presented, including the fact that the term of imprisonment was not the harshest authorized by statute, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County, rendered June 11, 1979, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and robbery in the first degree. On August 18, 1978, the defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class AI felony, and one count of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, a class D felony. Following his arraignment on this indictment on August 24, 1978, to which defendant entered a plea of not guilty, he was released on $25,000 bail. Subsequently, on March 23, 1979, the defendant was indicted for robbery in the first degree, in two counts (class B felonies), which were allegedly committed while the defendant was on bail pending trial of his prior offenses. Prior to June 11, 1979, the trial date set for the indictment for robbery, the defendant’s competent and capable retained attorneys commenced negotiations with the District Attorney’s office for a bargained plea in satisfaction of both indictments. The District Attorney’s office required a plea to one count of robbery in the first degree on the second indictment and a reduced plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree plus a waiver of a suppression issue that was pending in connection with the first indictment. In return, the District Attorney’s office would recommend sentences of one year to life on the first indictment and 5 to 15 years on the second, the sentences to run consecutively. This offer was fully explained to the defendant as an affidavit signed by the defendant and prepared by his attorneys attests. On June 11, 1979, the date scheduled for trial on the robbery charges, the defendant informed the court he wished to plead guilty. The prosecutor set forth the prior negotiations on the record and the defendant detailed his participation in the crimes, the voluntariness of his plea and his waiver of a jury trial thereby. In the colloquy with the court, the defendant admitted certain details of the robbery, but denied active participation with intent to forcibly steal. The defendant indicated, however, that he wished to plead. The court, however, refused to accept it, as did the prosecution who urged the case to proceed to trial.The defendant and his attorneys then retired to the privacy of a room for consultation and thereafter the defendant returned to court and admitted his full participation in Count No. 1 of the robbery indictment; that he had discussed the plea with his attorneys; that he realized the maximum that could be imposed and he desired to plead guilty. Upon doing so, he was sentenced to a term of one year to life on the first indictment and 5 to 15 years on the second. The sentences, however, were ordered to be served concurrently, an additional benefit to the defendant who bargained for consecutive sentences. The defendant’s contention now that he was denied effective representation of counsel; that his plea of guilty to robbery should not have been accepted since the defendant disclosed facts inconsistent with such plea; that the sentence imposed was excessive and should be vacated; all lack merit or factual substantiation (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338; People v St. Mary, 55 AD2d 968).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered October 31, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (three counts).
The record demonstrates that defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an aggregate prison term of 9 to 18 years. Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive given, inter alia, defendant’s admission of his culpability. Nevertheless, a sentence within permissible statutory ranges will not be disturbed unless extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification in the interest of justice (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, 685, lv denied 93 NY2d 872).

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), entered March 23, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, after a hearing.
In 2004, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced to six months in jail with five years of probation. More than a year after his release from custody, he moved to vacate his conviction on the ground that he was coerced to plead guilty by his codefendant and other inmates at the jail where he was held prior to his plea. Following a hearing at which several witnesses, including defendant and his codefendant, Harmeen Nix, testified, County Court denied the application. Defendant now appeals, and we affirm.
We agree with County Court that defendant has not demonstrated that he was under duress at the time of the plea. The transcript of the plea colloquy reveals that when asked whether he was being forced, threatened or coerced to plead guilty, defendant expressly answered “No.” Although he now contends that Nix and certain of Nix’s friends—who were inside the jail with defendant—pressured him to plead guilty so that Nix would be absolved, he admits that at no time prior to his plea did he mention any threats or coercion to his attorney, the District Attorney, the correction officers, or the court (see People v Hanley, 255 AD2d 837, 838 [1998], lv denied 92 NY2d 1050 [1999]). He claims that he kept silent because he believed no one could help him while he was confined in the jail; however, we note that he waited more than a year after his release before making this motion (see id.).
At the CPL article 440 hearing, defendant sought to admit tape recordings—and partial transcripts thereof—made by him of conversations he had with Nix and others after he was released from custody that purportedly prove his claims of duress. After initially reserving decision on the People’s objections, County Court ultimately refused to admit that evidence. As the tapes were indisputably hearsay, were not authenticated (see People v Ely, 68 NY2d 520, 527-528 [1986]; People v Bell, 5 AD3d 858, 861 [2004]) and, in any event, the tape-recorded individuals were called to testify at the hearing, we find no error in the court’s ruling. Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and found to be similarly unavailing.

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered September 12, 2013, (1) convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted grand larceny in the third degree, and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant was charged in a superior court information with attempted grand larceny in the third degree, and a petition was filed alleging that she had violated probation. Defendant was also charged along with others in a separate indictment with conspiracy and other crimes stemming from the distribution of cocaine (People v Cancer, 132 AD3d 1021 [2015] [decided herewith]). A joint plea agreement was negotiated to resolve all three matters, which required defendant’s cooperation. Pursuant thereto, defendant entered a guilty plea to attempted grand larceny in the third degree and admitted violating probation. She also pleaded guilty to a count of the indictment that charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (id.). As part of that agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal as to all three matters and signed a written waiver of appeal in open court.
At sentencing, County Court revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a one-year jail term with credit for time served on the violation petition. With respect to the attempted grand larceny conviction, the court granted defendant a conditional discharge and ordered her to pay certain restitution. At the subsequent sentencing on the drug conviction, the court imposed a one-year jail term thereon, to be served consecutively to the jail term imposed on the violation of probation (id.). Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction for attempted grand larceny in the third degree and the violation of probation.
On appeal, defendant’s only argument is that her one-year jail sentence imposed on September 12, 2013 is harsh and excessive, and that this claim is not precluded because her waiver of appeal was invalid. Given that defendant has necessarily completed that one-year jail sentence during the pendency of this appeal, any claims related to sentencing are moot (see People v Rodwell, 122 AD3d 1065, 1068 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1170 [2015]; People v Pozzi, 117 AD3d 1325, 1325 [2014]; People v Trombley, 111 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2013]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered January 20, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of grand larceny in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with grand larceny in the third degree. At that time, defendant entered into a plea agreement whereupon he pleaded guilty to the above charge with his sentencing deferred pending his participation in the Binghamton Adult Drug Treatment Court program. The agreement provided that defendant was waiving his right to appeal the conviction and sentence and, if defendant successfully completed the drug court program, he would be sentenced to five years of probation. It was also agreed that, if defendant breached the plea agreement, County Court would determine “the appropriate sentence,” with the understanding that the maximum permissible sentence was 21/s to 7 years in prison. Defendant executed a written consent to these conditions during the plea proceedings. Thereafter, defendant was terminated from his drug treatment program and the court, among other things, imposed a sentence of 2 to 6 years in prison, prompting this appeal.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant upon the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. We discern at least one issue of arguable merit related to the validity of the waiver of the right to appeal which may affect other potential appellate issues (see People v Secore, 102 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2013]). Accordingly, without passing judgment upon the ultimate merit of this issue, we grant counsel’s application and assign new counsel to address this issue and any others that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Murphy, J.), rendered September 21, 2015, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived her right to appeal. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to a five-year term of probation. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant contends that her plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because County Court failed to advise her that she would be giving up her constitutional privilege against self-incrimination by pleading guilty. While defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea survives the unchallenged appeal waiver (see People v Bond, 146 AD3d 1155, 1156 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1076 [2017]; People v Giammichele, 144 AD3d 1320, 1320 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1184 [2017]), her claim is unpreserved for our review as there is no indication in the record that she made an appropriate postallocution motion in the ample time that she had to do so prior to sentencing (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 381-382 [2015]; People v Golgoski, 145 AD3d 1195, 1195 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1184 [2017]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable as defendant made no statements during the plea colloquy that cast doubt upon her guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of her plea (see People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 219-220 [2016]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Johnson, 153 AD3d 1047, 1048 [2017]). We would, in any case, find that County Court adequately advised defendant of the trial-related rights that she was forfeiting by pleading guilty and that she expressed her understanding and waiver of those rights (see People v Bond, 146 AD3d at 1156; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered August 13, 2015, (1) convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
While on probation for her conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In exchange for the opportunity to participate in the judicial diversion program (hereinafter JDP), defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and to a violation of the terms of her probation and waived her right to appeal. Pursuant to the agreement, if defendant successfully completed the JDP, her plea to the two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree would be vacated, she would be permitted to plea to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and she would be resentenced to probation and continue probation in resolution of the violation of probation. Defendant was also informed that, if she failed to successfully complete the JDP, she faced a potential maximum prison term of 26V2 years. Subsequently, after defendant was terminated from the JDP, County Court sentenced her, as a second felony drug offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s valid appeal waiver forecloses our review of her claim that her sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Forget, 136 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 929 [2016]). Before accepting defendant’s plea, County Court confirmed that defendant, as a part of her plea, wished to voluntarily waive her right to appeal and further confirmed defendant’s understanding of the fact that her waiver of her right to appeal was separate and distinct from those rights that she automatically forfeited upon her plea of guilty. Defendant further acknowledged that she understood that she could not waive particular appellate rights, including any constitutional challenge based on her speedy trial right, the legality of the sentence, her own competency to stand trial and the voluntariness of her appeal waiver. Regardless of the fact that defendant never confirmed that she read and understood the written appeal waiver that she thereafter executed, this colloquy established that her waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Empey, 144 AD3d 1201, 1203 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1144 [2017]; People v Munger, 117 AD3d 1343, 1343 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1040 [2014]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment. Although defendant failed to appear at his first scheduled sentencing allegedly due to a seizure, he nevertheless was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 3 to 6 years at a subsequently rescheduled sentencing.
We reject defendant’s contention that his physical condition, allegedly resulting from a seizure a month earlier, impaired his ability to understand the sentencing proceeding. On the contrary, the record establishes that defendant’s behavior at sentencing was appropriate. Defendant duly responded to County Court’s inquiry regarding his status as a second felony offender and also advocated for a more lenient sentence. In view of the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in County Court’s failure to order a competency hearing (see, People v Planty, 238 AD2d 806, 807, lv denied 89 NY2d 1098).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered September 16, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was charged, in two indictments, with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. After the indictments were consolidated, he pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, in full satisfaction, with the understanding that he would receive a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years to life. The plea agreement included a waiver of his right to appeal, which County Court discussed with defendant on multiple occasions, describing the nature of the right and eliciting agreements of defendant’s understanding of that right. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate sentence of 7 years to life in prison and defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal encompasses his challenges to County Court’s audibility ruling, the severity of his sentence and the propriety of the People’s motion to consolidate the indictments (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 769-770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Jimenez, 277 AD2d 956, 956 [2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 784 [2001]; People v Rodriguez, 238 AD2d 150, 151 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 897 [1997]). Inasmuch as his argument does not impact the voluntariness of his guilty plea, defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is also foreclosed by his waiver of appeal (see People v Carroll, 21 AD3d 586, 586 [2005]; People v Wright, 21 AD3d 583, 583-584 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 857 [2005]).

No specific promise was made as to defendant’s sentence other than County Court’s commitment to sentence him to no less than three years to life and no more than five years to life. Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison sentence of four years to life. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Having knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered a guilty plea, which included an explicit waiver of his right to appeal, we conclude that defendant is precluded from challenging various issues raised herein. He cannot challenge his claimed defects in the Grand Jury proceedings and assertions of prosecutorial vindictiveness and selective prosecution (see, People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227; People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97; People v Lynch, 256 AD2d 651, lv denied 93 NY2d 1004). Furthermore, since defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the Grand Jury process does not include an allegation that “the alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea” (People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982; see, People v Lynch, supra), his waiver precludes judicial review of that issue.
Although it is true that the presence of alleged jurisdictional or constitutional defects in the Grand Jury proceeding that implicate the integrity of the process may survive a guilty plea and waiver of appeal (see, People v Hansen, supra), our review of defendant’s claims herein reveals contentions that could, at worst, be characterized as flaws of a technical or evidentiary nature that can be forfeited by a guilty plea (see, id.). Specifically, defendant maintains that the prosecution failed to advise the Grand Jury of his request, pursuant to CPL 190.50 (6), to have it hear the testimony of Ewart, the person listed as the addressee on the package received by defendant. As a result, defendant claims that this failure impaired the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding and rendered the indictment subject to dismissal pursuant to CPL 210.35 (5) (see, People v Butterfield, 267 AD2d 870, lv denied 95 NY2d 833). Regardless of the merit of this claim, however, in our view a claimed violation of this statutory right does not “activate a question of jurisdiction” or constitute a constitutional defect and, thus, does not survive a guilty plea (People v Hansen, supra, at 231). Accordingly, we cannot adopt defendant’s view that the indictment must be dismissed on this ground.
The remaining issues raised by defendant have been examined and, to the extent that they have been preserved for appellate review, been found to be without merit.

Defendant’s request that the prosecution advise the Grand Jury foreperson of defendant’s request to have Federal Express employees, the handler of the dog that sniffed the package and every person who handled the package, including law enforcement personnel, testify was agreed to by the District Attorney prior to the Grand Jury proceedings and our review of the Grand Jury minutes appears to establish that the individuals who handled the package did, in fact, testify.",,663,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered January 7, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment against him. Thereafter, County Court imposed a sentence of three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision for each count, to be served concurrently. After pronouncement of the sentences, defendant requested that they be ordered to be served concurrently with a prison term of lVs to 4 years he had received in Essex County as a result of his conviction there for attempted burglary in the third degree. The court declined defendant’s request and he now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that his current sentences should run concurrently with that imposed in Essex County in the absence of a judicial pronouncement that they be served consecutively. Pursuant to Penal Law § 70.25 (1), a sentence shall run either concurrently or consecutively with respect to an undischarged term of imprisonment as the court directs at the time of sentence. Here, County Court’s intention that the sentences imposed were to be served consecutively to defendant’s existing sentence was unequivocal, inasmuch as the court expressly rejected defendant’s request that the sentences be ordered to be served concurrently (see Matter of Welch v Fischer, 70 AD3d 1077 [2010]).

"Peters, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Ledina, J.), rendered April 19, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and promoting prison contraband in the first degree.
Defendant was indicted in November 1998 for both criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. He was later charged by superior court information with the crime of promoting prison contraband in the first degree. In satisfaction of all pending charges, he pleaded guilty to the criminal possession and promoting prison contraband charges. After lengthy negotiation, it was agreed that defendant would not waive his right to appeal and he would be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 9 years for the criminal possession charge and 1 to 3 years for the promoting prison contraband charge, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, involuntariness of his plea, and excessiveness of his sentence.
In support of his claim of ineffective assistance, defendant contends that trial counsel misapprehended the facts surrounding the issuance and execution of the search warrant, that counsel failed to challenge the police officers’ execution of the warrant by the search of three separate structures, and that counsel failed to move to suppress the results of the search. In making our assessment, we are guided that “[s]o long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation, the constitutional requirement will have been met” (People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Here, the record reveals that defense counsel familiarized himself with all relevant legal issues and reviewed all necessary documents concerning the warrant. His failure to move to suppress the evidence seized does not necessarily indicate ineffectiveness (see, People v Wagner, 104 AD2d 457, 458). While police authorities may have visited other structures in executing the warrant, the critical evidence seized was all located in defendant’s residence. Moreover, the record fails to provide any support for defendant’s assertion that he would have standing to challenge the visits to the other structures (see, People v Ponder, 54 NY2d 160).
As to the plea, we discern no error in the allocution and find it evident that defense counsel negotiated an extremely favorable result (see, People v Ruger, 279 AD2d 795, lv denied 96 NY2d 806). “[W]hile a guilty plea does not preclude inquiry into the effectiveness of defense counsel in making pretrial motions * * *, the fact that a favorable plea bargain was struck is a factor to be considered” (People v Strempack, 134 AD2d 799, 800, affd 71 NY2d 1015 [citation omitted]).
Turning to the sentence, we note that upon defendant’s articulation of his plea, he asserted that this was his “first offense.” The presentence investigation belied this assertion; it revealed that while he had not been convicted of a felony, he had been previously convicted of misdemeanors. Had defendant been tried and convicted on all the pending charges, he could have been sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of up to SVs to 25 years on the crimes for which he was indicted and up to 21/s to 7 years on the charge of promoting prison contraband. With the record revealing no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances that would cause us to interfere with the sentence imposed (see, People v Gregory, 290 AD2d 810; People v La Shomb, 285 AD2d 837), we affirm.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered April 18, 1977, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of seven years to life. The sole issue on this appeal concerns the right of the defendant to listen to and examine the entire tape recording and whether it was error to receive in evidence that part of the recording which recorded an alleged conversation between the defendant and a witness. It is not necessary to decide the issue as to whether the defendant is entitled to listen to all of the tape. This court, after a playing of the tape, concludes that the rights of the defendant were in no way violated nor was he prejudiced by the ruling of the court.

"Malone Jr., J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), rendered July 3, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant to IV2 years in prison, imposed a $1,000 fine and ordered restitution in the amount of $10.
Defendant asserts that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because County Court failed to adequately explore his potential intoxication defense. While such a claim remains reviewable despite defendant’s guilty plea and appeal waiver, the record reveals that County Court satisfied its duty to inquire further (see People v Carter, 62 AD3d 1154, 1154-1155 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009]; People v Sterling, 57 AD3d 1110, 1112 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 788 [2009]). Indeed, after defendant stated that his behavior was unintentional because he was intoxicated when he sold the controlled substance, County Court immediately informed defendant that the crime to which he was pleading guilty required criminal intent, advised him of the possible intoxication defense and asked him whether he was voluntarily waiving such a defense. Defendant acknowledged that he was and stated that he had discussed the matter with his attorney. Accordingly, County Court properly accepted defendant’s guilty plea only after ensuring that defendant’s waiver of the potential intoxication defense was knowing and voluntary (see People v Munck, 278 AD2d 662, 662-663 [2000]).
We also note that, “since defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser crime than the one charged in the indictment, a factual basis for the plea was unnecessary” (People v Moore, 71 NY2d 1002, 1006 [1988]). Thus, we reject defendant’s contention that his plea allocution was insufficient (see People v Lozovsky, 267 AD2d 774, 776 [1999], lv denied 95 NY2d 836 [2000]). Finally, as the record reveals that the fine and restitution were part of defendant’s plea agreement, County Court did not impose an enhanced sentence and there is no basis to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea (compare People v McCarthy, 56 AD3d 904, 905 [2008]).

In satisfaction of a superior court information, defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. He was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to six years in prison, with three years of postrelease supervision, for the weapons conviction and a concurrent prison term of 3 to 9 years on the drug-related charge. Although defendant contends on appeal that youthful offender status should have been considered and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, he forfeited the right to argue these issues given his waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Vedder, 1 AD3d 803, 803 [2003]; People v Crippen, 284 AD2d 575, 575 [2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 640 [2001]).

"Casey, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered May 26, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On May 5, 1989, defendant, through his counsel, offered to plead guilty to the two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance alleged in the indictment. County Court explained the rights defendant would relinquish by the plea, defined the crime as encompassing the sale of cocaine, and agreed that the court had previously committed itself to a sentence of not more than 5 to 10 years but that defense counsel could seek a more lenient sentence. Defendant then admitted that he was approached by a person named Ridley to ""get some drugs for him” and agreed to do so for $60. Defendant also admitted that on November 10, 1988 at about 12:30 a.m., at the State Street entrance to Bliss Towers in the City of Hudson, Columbia County, he obtained the cocaine, turned it over to Ridley and received $40, but ""had to bring the money back”. This last phrase is not explained or amplified. Defendant then entered a plea of guilty to the first count of the indictment. The plea allocution also reveals that about 10:00 p.m. on that same day at the same location, defendant stated that he was again approached by Ridley who ""wanted to buy drugs”. Ridley specifically stated that he wanted four vials of crack, which defendant obtained. According to defendant, he sold ""those to Mr. Ridley” for what defendant remembers to be $60. Defendant then entered a plea of guilty to the second count of the indictment. County Court mentioned that defendant had a prior felony offense within recent years and ordered a presentence report from the Department of Probation. At the sentencing hearing, defendant moved to withdraw his prior plea and requested a trial as soon as possible. The reasons given were ineffective assistance of counsel and defendant’s misunderstanding of what his sentence would be. The District Attorney’s objection to this motion was sustained and the court proceeded to sentence defendant as a second felony offender after defendant admitted the prior felony. The District Attorney recommended a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. Defense counsel recommended the minimum sentence permitted. The court imposed the minimum sentence of 4 Vi to 9 years in prison on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.
On this appeal, defendant urges that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea for the reason, advanced here for the first time, that he acted as agent of the buyer and was not a seller. In our opinion, the facts recited above are unambiguous and do not accommodate to defendant’s contention that he was acting as the agent of the buyer. The possibility of such an agency relationship should not now inure to defendant’s benefit when it was not raised in County Court and when he received the minimum sentence allowable to him as a prior felony offender. The facts recited in the allocution were adequate to sustain the plea. In his own words, defendant admitted to two sales, one for $40 and the second for $60. The allocution indicates that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights and entered his plea (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9). A defendant who accepts such a bargained for plea forfeits his right to challenge the factual basis for the plea (see, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97, 108; People v Clairborne, 29 NY2d 950, 951). Defendant received more than the benefit of his plea bargain in the minimum sentence imposed. We see no reason, therefore, to interfere with the judgment in the interest of justice (see, People v Nasti, 90 AD2d 507). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"Crew III, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered October 15, 2001, (1) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
Defendant was serving a term of probation following his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree when he was arrested and charged with three counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, resisting arrest and tampering with physical evidence. His arrest also resulted in the additional charge of violating the terms of his probation. Defendant entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to the terms of which he pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the multicount indictment in exchange for being sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. A concurrent sentence of 21/s to 7 years also was imposed following his admission to violating the terms of his probation. In conjunction therewith, defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.
On this appeal, defendant contends that the waiver of his right to appeal does not encompass his right to challenge his sentence inasmuch as he was not advised, at the plea allocution, of the maximum that he could receive. We agree (see People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513), but nevertheless affirm. Our review of the record convinces us that the sentences imposed were not harsh or excessive given defendant’s prior criminal record, the fact that he was serving a sentence of probation when he committed additional drug-related crimes and that he received the sentences under review as part of a favorable plea bargain pursuant to which several other charges against him were dismissed. As we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences in the interest of justice, they will not be disturbed (see People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 815; People v Mickens, 275 AD2d 818, 819).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered November 20, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Upon pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of seven years to life. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that his history of drug dependence, his attendance in a drug rehabilitation program and his cooperation with drug enforcement officials regarding on-going drug investigations constituted extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in his sentence. We disagree. First, defendant derived a benefit by being allowed to plead guilty to a reduced charge, which carried with it a more lenient sentence (compare, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i], with Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [a]). In addition, the sentence imposed was within the range promised at the time defendant entered Ms guilty plea (see, People v Spratt, 135 AD2d 983, lv denied 71 NY2d 903). Finally, it has been held that a person’s drug problem does not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in one’s sentence (see, People v Honsinger, 162 AB2d 877, 878, lv denied 76 NY2d 894; People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, 781, Iv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"Malone Jr., J.
Following an investigation into a drug distribution operation in Schenectady County and Albany County, defendant was charged with eight drug-related offenses. Defendant successfully moved to dismiss four of the eight charges against him and, in full satisfaction of those remaining charges, defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a five-year prison term with two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s failure to move to either withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Cintron, 62 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 742 [2009]). The exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable as the plea colloquy did not negate an essential element of the crime and defendant’s guilt was adequately established (see id.).
To the extent that defendant claims that ineffective assistance of counsel affected the voluntariness of his plea, which claim survives defendant’s valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Crudup, 45 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2007]), that claim is unpreserved given defendant’s failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]). In any event, the record reveals that defendant was provided with meaningful representation (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 853 [2009]).
Defendant’s challenges related to the search warrant do not survive his valid waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Anderson, 63 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 794 [2009]). Similarly, defendant’s challenge to County Court’s denial of his suppression motion does not survive the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]). Finally, the waiver also precludes his claim that the negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Walley, 63 AD3d 1284, 1286 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered May 27, 2015, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In 2013, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived the right to appeal. He was sentenced to five years of probation, the terms of which included, among other things, that he successfully complete the Albany County drug court program. County Court explained that, under the plea agreement, if defendant failed to complete the program or otherwise violated a condition of probation, his probation would be revoked and he would be sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of no less than seven years or more than eight years, with three years of postrelease supervision. In 2015, defendant pleaded guilty to violating the terms of his probation by, among other things, being arrested and failing to complete the drug court program, and he waived the right to appeal. County Court revoked his probation and sentenced him, as a second felony drug offender, to seven years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We reject defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid (see People v Bartlett, 148 AD3d 1468, 1469 [2017]; People v Dolberry, 147 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1078 [2017]). Defendant’s contention that his guilty plea to the probation violation was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary survives his appeal waiver but is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Woodard, 139 AD3d 1238, 1238 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 939 [2016]; People v Secore, 102 AD3d 1057, 1058 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1019 [2013]). Moreover, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt or cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Jones, 139 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]; People v McGregor, 119 AD3d 1235, 1236 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 991 [2015]). Similarly, to the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims implicate the voluntariness of his plea, such claims survive his valid appeal waiver but are not preserved for our review absent an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Dubois, 150 AD3d 1562, 1563-1564 [2017]; People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]).
Defendant also contends that his federal drug conspiracy conviction does not qualify as a predicate New York felony and, therefore, it cannot serve as a basis for his second felony drug offender adjudication. Although this claim is being raised for the first time on appeal, we find that the claim “falls within the narrow exception to our preservation rule permitting appellate review when a sentence’s illegality is readily discernible from the . . . record” (People v Santiago, 22 NY3d 900, 903 [2013]; see People v Samms, 95 NY2d 52, 55-56 [2000]; People v Martinez, 130 AD3d 1087, 1088 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1010 [2015]). In the special information charging a predicate offense, the People alleged that defendant was previously convicted in the US District Court for the Northern District of New York of conspiracy to distribute marihuana (21 USC §§ 841, 846). However, the Court of Appeals has determined that, “under New York’s ‘strict equivalency standard for convictions rendered in other jurisdictions, a federal conviction for conspiracy to commit a drug crime may not serve as a predicate felony for sentencing purposes” (People v Ramos, 19 NY3d 417, 418 [2012]). We therefore vacate the sentence and remit the matter to County Court for resentencing (see People v Parker, 121 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2014]).

"Mikoll, J. P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered January 7, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
The issue here is whether County Court can enhance a sentence when defendant breaches a specific condition of a plea negotiation, which, in this instance, was to pay a fine. In satisfaction of three indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree. Defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender on all three counts. Specifically, with regard to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, defendant was promised a prison sentence of 316 to 7 years conditioned on him paying a $2,000 fine at sentencing. On the remaining drug-related count and the firearm count, defendant was promised a prison sentence of 2 to 4 years and 3 Vi to 7 years, respectively; all sentences were to run concurrently with one another. Defendant was also to pay $270 in restitution. County Court ordered a presentence investigation and instructed defendant that if it were unable to fulfill the agreed-upon sentence, it would allow defendant to withdraw his plea.
At sentencing, defendant’s counsel informed County Court that defendant was unable to pay the $2,000 fine and requested that the court permit a withdrawal of defendant’s plea. The request was denied and, as a result of his inability to pay the fine, defendant’s sentence on one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was increased from 3Vi to 7 years’ imprisonment to &\6 to 9 years’ imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced on the remaining two charges as agreed upon and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $270.
It has been held that a sentence can be enhanced if defendant violates explicit conditions of plea negotiation (see, People v Dickerson, 110 AD2d 846, lv denied 66 NY2d 762). If a court is unwilling or unable to sentence a defendant in accordance with its promise, the defendant must be given an opportunity to withdraw the plea (see, People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). The record does not indicate that defendant was advised that a harsher sentence would ensue should he be unable to fulfill the financial conditions of the plea, nor can it be implied otherwise from the record. County Court conducted no inquiry as to the reason for defendant’s failure to pay the $2,000 fine. We note that the probation report indicates that defendant is indigent. County Court deprived defendant of an opportunity to explain the factor that caused the court to increase his prison sentence, a practice of which this Court does not approve (see, People v Banks, 161 AD2d 957).

"— Appeals by defendant from three judgments of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Feldman, J.), each rendered August 1, 1984, convicting him under indictment No. 2958/83 of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, under indictment No. 7400/83 of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and under indictment No. 3306/83 of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences.
Judgment as to indictment No. 2958/83 modified as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing defendant’s conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. As so modified, judgment under indictment No. 2958/83 affirmed.
Judgments under indictments Nos. 7400/83 and 3306/83 affirmed.
Defendant entered into a plea bargain agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty to certain crimes under three separate indictments (indictments Nos. 2958/83, 7400/83 and 3306/83) and in satisfaction of a pending Criminal Court case. It is clear from the plea minutes that it was agreed that under indictment No. 2958/83 — the top count of which was criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, an A-I felony — defendant would plead guilty to an A-II felony. Further, in accordance with that agreement, the court promised to sentence defendant to a term of six years to life imprisonment, such sentence being the minimum permissible sentence upon a conviction of an A-II felony as a second felony offender (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [4] [a]). In entering his plea under indictment No. 2958/83, however, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (see, Penal Law § 220.21). Thereafter, at sentencing, the court imposed a sentence of six years to life upon such conviction in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.
We now modify that conviction, in the interest of justice and upon the request of the People, by reducing it to one of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, an A-II felony (see, Penal Law § 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement. Further, since the sentence imposed upon defendant’s conviction under indictment No. 2958/83 of six years to life was the sentence promised and is the minimum permissible sentence which could be imposed upon defendant’s conviction, as a second felony offender, of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, there is no purpose to be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.
We have examined the issues raised by defendant in his brief and find them to be either unpreserved or without merit (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered October 3, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of three counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, arising out of separate sales of cocaine to an undercover police officer. Defendant made pretrial motions for various relief, hearings were conducted and the matter proceeded to trial. After the prosecution presented its case and defendant testified on his own behalf, a plea bargain was reached whereby defendant entered a plea of guilty to each count of the indictment with the understanding that the sentences to be imposed would not exceed an aggregate prison term of 5 to 15 years. At the time fixed for sentencing, defendant’s attorney made an oral motion to withdraw defendant’s guilty plea upon the grounds that defendant was not satisfied with the legal representation he received, that defendant entered the plea ""against his own judgment”, and that defendant felt threatened or coerced into pleading guilty because of ""possible perjury charges which may have been brought” against him. County Court denied the motion and proceeded to sentence defendant in accordance with the plea bargain to concurrent prison terms of 5 to 15 years. Defendant appeals, contending only that County Court erred in denying the motion to withdraw his plea of guilty without conducting a ""limited interrogation” to determine the basis for the motion.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, the Trial Judge, after ascertaining the prosecution’s position on defendant’s motion and then stating his own views on the matter, did give defendant an adequate opportunity to speak on his own behalf (see, People v Tinsley, 35 NY2d 926, 927). Defendant declined to make a statement at that time (see, People v Oliver, 163 AD2d 686), did not raise the claim of ineffective counsel in a posttrial application (see, People v Ramos, 63 NY2d 640, 643; cf., People v Braun, 167 AD2d 164; People v Jones, 95 AD2d 869, 870), and even now gives no indication of the manner in which his legal representation is claimed to have been deficient. Moreover, based upon his participation in the pretrial motions, hearings and the trial of the indictment, as well as the lengthy plea proceeding, the Trial Judge could make his own assessment of the competence of defendant’s attorney (see, People v Braun, supra) and the voluntariness of defendant’s guilty plea (see, People v Adams, 151 AD2d 921, 922; see also, People v Ramos, supra, at 642-643; People v Jones, supra). Finally, based upon our own review of the record, we are in accord with County Court’s determination that defendant was afforded meaningful representation and that his plea was voluntarily entered, particularly in view of the evidence of guilt adduced at trial and the fact that defendant has made no protestation of innocence (see, People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, 885, lv denied 75 NY2d 921; People v Jones, supra; cf., People v McKennion, 27 NY2d 671, 672-673).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 14, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and County Court agreed to sentence him as a youthful offender to four months in jail and five years’ probation. Two weeks prior to the scheduled sentencing date, defendant completed service of the equivalent of the proposed four-month jail term and County Court released him on his own recognizance after he expressly agreed that if he failed to appear for sentencing, or was charged with committing another crime in the interim, he would be sentenced as an adult to a potential prison term of 5 to 15 years. Defendant thereafter failed to appear for sentencing due to his arrest on charges of robbery in the first and second degrees in Kings County. He ultimately pleaded guilty to robbery in the third degree in satisfaction of those charges and was returned to Broome County. County Court then found that his arrest and guilty plea in Kings County constituted a violation of the conditions imposed upon his release and sentenced him to 5 to 15 years, in prison.
On his appeal, defendant makes only two arguments. First, he contends that County Court improperly refused to conduct a hearing as to his claim of innocence of the Kings County charges. We disagree. Inasmuch as defendant pleaded guilty to the intervening Kings County charges and advised County Court that he had no intention of moving to withdraw that guilty plea, there was no issue of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing as to whether he had violated the conditions of his release (see People v Coleman, 270 AD2d 713, 714 [2000]). Second, defendant argues that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Despite defendant’s lack of a prior criminal history, we find neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention given his awareness of the consequences for violating the release conditions imposed and his undisturbed plea of guilty to a felony committed while on release (see People v Peguero, 7 AD3d 925, 925-926 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 661 [2004]; People v Gay, 305 AD2d 856, 856 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 620 [2003]; People v Diaz, 264 AD2d 879, 880 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 879 [2000]).

Following an extensive police undercover investigation implicating defendant in the sale of drugs, defendant was charged with a number of drug-related crimes and ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right of appeal and was sentenced to a term of 7 years to life in prison. Inasmuch as defendant waived his right of appeal, he may not now challenge the severity of the sentence. Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits of defendant’s claim, we would not find that the sentence imposed is harsh or excessive. Defendant was significantly involved in the sale of drugs on a large-scale basis. In view of this, as well as the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we would find no reason to disturb County Court’s judgment.

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree in satisfaction of four indictments charging him with 31 counts of various drug and weapon-related crimes. Defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms, the maximum of which was 4 to 12 years on the criminal sale conviction. Defendant appeals arguing that he did not validly waive his right to appeal and that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive.
Initially, inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant’s challenge to the validity of his waiver of appeal rights is unpreserved for this Court’s review (see People v Sullivan, 37 AD3d 974 [2007]; People v Crowley, 34 AD3d 866 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 924 [2006]). In any event, were we to consider the issue, we would find that the record demonstrates County Court adequately explained that “the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” and defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Morgan, 39 AD3d 889, 889 [2007]).

"OPINION OF THE COURT
Tom, J.P.
In this appeal, defendant asks this Court to exercise its interest-of-justice power to review and reduce his sentence, negotiated pursuant to a plea agreement, on the grounds that his waiver of his right to appeal was invalid and that his sentence was excessive.
In February 2013, defendant was arrested after selling crack cocaine and marijuana to an undercover police officer. After apprehending him, the police recovered two credit cards and one photo ID card from his pocket, all belonging to an individual who was not defendant. Defendant was indicted for one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree, and two counts of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.
Before trial, defendant agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree in satisfaction of all charges and in exchange for concurrent sentences of 2V2 years on the criminal sale count and IV2 to 3 years on the stolen property count. As part of the bargain, he agreed to waive his right to appeal and judgment was entered as agreed upon.
Notwithstanding the waiver, defendant appealed to this Court asserting that his appeal waiver was invalid and unenforceable and that his sentence was excessive and should be modified in the interest of justice. We find that the record establishes that defendant was properly apprised of the implications of waiving his right to appeal and that defendant made a valid waiver of his right to appeal, which forecloses review of his excessive sentence claim (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]).
The record discloses that upon accepting defendant’s guilty plea, the court, in a lengthy plea allocution, and after explaining all the “trial rights” defendant was waiving and ensuring he spoke to his attorney about the plea, and was satisfied with his legal help, then engaged in the following colloquy:
“THE COURT: Now, in this case as part of the plea and sentence I promised you, you’re being required to waive or give up your right to appeal this conviction.
“Let me explain to you what that means. This is a separate right. It is not a trial right. It’s a separate right, the right to appeal.
“So normally a defendant has the right to appeal a criminal conviction . . .
“An appeal is a legal proceeding before another court. It’s a higher court. It’s not before me or Judge Ward, it’s before an appeals court.
“On the appeal a defendant, through his lawyer, can argue that some mistake was made in connection with his case, some error, something was wrong. You could also argue that the sentence was too much, too harsh and ask for a lower sentence if one was allowed by law . . .
“Now, normally even when a defendant pleads guilty he still has certain rights. With the guilty plea you don’t give up all your rights normally.
“In this case because of the sentence that I’m promising you, you’re being required to give up your right to appeal any aspect of this case in return for the plea and sentence I promised you.
“So do you understand that explanation?
“THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.
“THE COURT: Are you willing to do that?
“THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.”
This language exceeds the colloquy that provided for a valid waiver in People v Nicholson, one of the cases consolidated under People v Lopez (6 NY3d at 254-255). The trial court ensured that defendant understood that the right to appeal was separate from the “panoply of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty,” and advised him that while he “ordinarily retains the right to an appeal even after pleading guilty, in this case he was being offered a particular plea by the prosecution on the condition that he give up that right” (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 257; see also People v Rahman, 129 AD3d 553, 554 [1st Dept 2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 933 [2015] [“The court discussed the waiver in detail and sufficiently ensured that defendant understood that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the other rights automatically forfeited by pleading guilty”]). As was the case in Nicholson, it would have been better to secure a written waiver of the right to appeal. However, the record is sufficient to establish that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256, citing People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]).
A defendant who has validly waived his right to appeal may not invoke this Court’s interest-of-justice jurisdiction to reduce a bargained-for sentence (Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255-256). “By pleading guilty and waiving the right to appeal, a defendant has forgone review of the terms of the plea, including harshness or excessiveness of the sentence” (id. at 256).
To be sure, as the Court of Appeals clarified in Lopez, the Appellate Division may be divested of its unique interest-of-justice jurisdiction only by constitutional amendment (6 NY3d at 255, citing People v Pollenz, 67 NY2d 264, 267-268 [1986]). However, as Lopez went on to hold, “a defendant is free to relinquish the right to invoke that authority and indeed does so by validly waiving the right to appeal” (id.).
In People v Seaberg (74 NY2d 1 [1989]), the Court of Appeals further explained that “[b]y pleading guilty a defendant forecloses the appellate court from reviewing the merits of the plea bargain in the interest of justice and there is nothing inherently wrong in a defendant similarly electing to foreclose review of a negotiated sentence” (id. at 10). Stated another way,
“a bargained-for waiver of the right to appeal . . . does not operate to deprive the appellate court of its jurisdiction of the appeal. Instead, it merely forecloses appellate review of all claims that might be raised on appeal, except, of course, those categories of claims that survive such waivers under our case law” (People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 285 [1992]).
Further, as the majority in Lopez noted, as a practical matter the request to reduce a sentence as excessive is “brought to an appellate court’s attention only when raised by defendants” (6 NY3d at 256). Thus, while the Appellate Division may technically retain its interest-of-justice jurisdiction at all times, a defendant cannot “eviscerate” an agreement not to appeal a conviction and rely on the Court’s inherent discretionary powers to reduce the sentence. Indeed, such a result would render a valid waiver of appeal meaningless and would be detrimental to the goals of “fairness and finality in criminal matters!, which] are accomplished only insofar as the parties are confident that the ‘carefully orchestrated bargain’ of an agreed-upon sentence will not be disturbed as a discretionary matter” (id. at 256, quoting People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d at 10).
In short, “[h]aving received the benefit of his bargain, defendant should be bound by its terms” (People v Lopez, 190 AD2d 545, 545 [1st Dept 1993]). This record provides no compelling evidence of special circumstances warranting the contrary.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (Roger S. Hayes, J.), rendered March 20, 2014, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, and sentencing him, as a second drug felony offender, to an aggregate term of IV2 to 3 years, should be affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered May 29, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of promoting prostitution in the second degree.
Defendant contends that his sentence of 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty as a second felony offender to one count of promoting prostitution in the second degree in full satisfaction of a five-count indictment. Sentencing was then adjourned so that defendant could attend an 18-month drug rehabilitation program with the understanding that if defendant failed to satisfactorily complete the program County Court could impose any sentence it felt appropriate. Defendant subsequently was dismissed from the rehabilitation program and was sentenced to 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment. Defendant admittedly was dismissed from the rehabilitation program because of his conviction of a misdemeanor drug charge. Once defendant was dismissed from the program, by the terms of the plea agreement County Court could sentence him to up to 7 Vi to 15 years’ imprisonment (see, People v Chevalier, 92 AD2d 944). In consideration of these facts, and that defendant was given the most lenient sentence possible, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, lv denied 75 NY2d 812).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered April 1, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of 3V2 to 7 years in prison and one year in jail, respectively. Before defendant was sentenced, the laws regarding sentencing for drug felonies were changed and, as a result, the prosecution agreed to the imposition of a lesser sentence. Consequently, on the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, County Court sentenced defendant to 3V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. On the charge of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree, County Court sentenced defendant to a conditional discharge. Defendant appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Inasmuch as defendant could have received an even shorter prison sentence under the recent drug law amendments (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [iii]), we are of the view that there is at least one issue of arguable merit pertaining to the severity of the sentence (see People v Smith, 32 AD3d 553, 553-554 [2006]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]). Thus, without passing judgment on the ultimate merit of this issue, appellate counsel is relieved and new counsel will be appointed to address this issue and any others that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]; People v Cruwys, supra).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered March 15, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in third degree (two counts).
Defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in third degree arising out of the sale of heroin and cocaine to a confidential informant. Defendant rejected a plea agreement offered by the People, pursuant to which he would plead guilty to one charge in the indictment and receive eight years in prison. Defendant did plead guilty as charged, however, with the understanding that he would be sentenced by County Court to a determinate prison term between 5 and 10 years, with the potential that restitution would be awarded. The court thereafter sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, and ordered that defendant pay $370 in restitution. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we note that defendant’s pro se claims regarding the involuntariness of his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel involve matters outside the record and, thus, are more appropriately raised in a CPL article 440 motion to vacate the judgment (see e.g. People v DeCapria, 121 AD3d 1432, 1433 [2014]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2014]). Defendant failed to preserve his sole remaining argument challenging the amount of restitution because he did not request a hearing or otherwise challenge the award of restitution at sentencing, and corrective action in the interest of justice is unwarranted (see People v Ortolaza, 120 AD3d 843, 844 [2014]; People v White, 119 AD3d 1286, 1287 [2014]).

As a result of her use of forged documents to obtain prescription drugs, defendant was convicted of three counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and four counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. She was sentenced to prison terms of 2 to 6 years for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and for each count of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree. A one-year jail sentence was imposed for each count of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the seventh degree, with all sentences to run concurrently. We reject defendant’s claim that her sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant intentionally defied the law in order to satisfy her addiction and County Court imposed a sentence within statutory guidelines. In view of these considerations, we do not find that County Court abused its discretion.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County, rendered November 30, 1970, upon a verdict convicting defendant of two counts of selling a dangerous drug, third degree and possession of a hypodermic needle. Defendant and several others were indicted on various drug charges as the result of an investigation conducted in the Greene County area. Defendant was tried and convicted of two sales of heroin and possession of a hypodermic needle. He was sentenced to 3 to 15 years on each of the heroin sales, and received one year on the possession of a hypodermic needle. The sentences were to run concurrently. All of the others indicted, after pleas of guilty, received probationary sentences. The sole issue raised by defendant on this appeal is that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive, particularly in view of the fact that the others were all placed on probation. The imposition of sentence rests with the discretion of the trial court and we should not reduce the sentence unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. (People v. Oaputo, 13 A D 2d 861.) An examination of the instant record reveals testimony that defendant was not an addict, had a substantial job and was a supplier of drugs. Two of the counts were felonies, the other a misdemeanor. Under all of these circumstances we cannot say the court abused its discretion in the sentences imposed. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

On this appeal, defendant challenges his conviction and sentence on numerous grounds, all of which are without merit. Initially, we reject his constitutional attacks upon section 70.00 of the Penal Law and CPL 220.10 (subd 6, par [a]) on the authority of People v Venable (46 AD2d 73). Also, there was no showing that the prosecution aided police informant Jerome Powell in his leaving this jurisdiction, and, furthermore, the prosecution had no duty to produce him at trial (People v Fowler, 46 AD2d 838). As to defendant’s remaining contentions, nothing in the prosecutor’s summation warrants a reversal of this conviction, and there is nothing inconsistent in the jury’s verdicts of guilty and not guilty to the two charges of criminal sale against defendant because the record reveals significant differences in the proof offered on each charge.

"Mercure, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Lamont, J.), entered April 7, 2000 in Ulster County, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts).
Defendant was indicted on September 1, 1998, and charged with the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts). The People declared their readiness for trial in open court on September 23, 1998, and the matter proceeded to trial before County Court. On May 26, 1999, following jury selection, opening statements by counsel and the partial testimony of a police officer, County Court (Bruhn, J.) sua sponte declared a mistrial with the consent of the parties after determining that the trial would take longer than the time originally allotted and interfere with the ability to maintain a jury of 12 persons. Although the People have consistently maintained that they did not object to the court’s suggestion that a new trial be scheduled to commence in September 1999 and that they remained ready for trial following the declaration of the mistrial, they did not expressly communicate their readiness to proceed on the record in open court or by written notice to defense counsel and the court.
The case was transferred to Supreme Court, Ulster County, and a new trial commenced on January 31, 2000. Following a hearing, defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds was denied. A second trial was held, at the close of which defendant was convicted on all counts and sentenced to, inter alia, six years to life in prison. Defendant now appeals, arguing, among other things, that Supreme Court erred in denying his CPL 30.30 motion to dismiss the indictment.
When a defendant is accused of a felony, the People have six months from “the commencement of [the] criminal action” to declare their readiness (CPL 30.30 [1] [a]). CPL 30.30 (5) (a) provides that “where the defendant is to be * * * retried following a mistrial, * * * the criminal action * * * must be deemed to have commenced on the date the * * * order occasioning a retrial becomes final.” Accordingly, once County Court declared a mistrial upon its own motion on May 26, 1999, the People had until November 26, 1999 to declare themselves “ready for trial.” While the People assert that they remained ready to proceed, they failed to declare readiness either in open court or by written notice sent to both defense counsel and the appropriate court clerk following the declaration of the mistrial. Therefore, they were not “ready for trial” within the meaning of the statute (see People v Chavis, 91 NY2d 500, 505).
The People argue that their CPL 30.30 responsibilities were satisfied by their initial, pre-mistrial declaration. This argument is contrary to the literal language of the statute, which clearly provides that the criminal action is deemed to have recommenced, thus triggering the speedy trial clock, when a mistrial is declared and a new trial is ordered (see People v Delacruz, 241 AD2d 328, 328, lv denied 90 NY2d 939; People v Weaver, 162 AD2d 486, 487, lv denied 76 NY2d 868; People v Fudger, 70 AD2d 703, 703; cf. People v Cortes, 80 NY2d 201, 214-215; People v Tamulewicz, 88 AD2d 698). Inasmuch as the People make no further attempt to show, and the record does not indicate, that any time periods should be excluded under CPL 30.30 (4), the indictment should be dismissed (see People v Chavis, supra at 504-505). In light of our determination, it is unnecessary to consider defendant’s alternative arguments in favor of reversal.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Barrett, J.), rendered April 23, 1982, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
The charge to which defendant pleaded guilty was in full satisfaction of seven other charges which included five related to controlled substances, one for criminal possession of a weapon and one for bail jumping. The record demonstrates that defendant was fully advised of all his rights and the consequences of his plea at the time the provisions for the negotiated plea were placed on the record. There is no merit to defendant’s contention upon this appeal that his representation by counsel was inadequate, for the transcript of all the proceedings before County Court establishes, conclusively, otherwise.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County, rendered October 28, 1977, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a maximum of life and a minimum of one year. The defendant and one Mancini were charged with crimes as the result of a sale of heroin on February 7, 1976 to a ""friend” of the defendant. The ""friend” was acting as an informant because he had been arrested on February 6, 1976 by the police on various charges and he was offered immunity if he co-operated as to Manos. All three (defendant, Mancini and informant) were represented by one law firm in their criminal difficulties with Mancini and defendant being represented by the same lawyer in the early stages of the proceedings against them. The District Attorney, perceiving a conflict of interest between Mancini and the defendant, moved the trial court for an order directing either of the defendants to obtain independent counsel. A hearing was held at which the problem was fully explored upon the record with both defendants present. The trial court held an off the record discussion with the defendants and subsequently noted in its decision denying the motion: ""In spite of all this, the defendants continue to express a desire to be represented by defense counsel of their choice.” Upon this appeal the defendant contends that the trial court should have ordered that the law firm (or attorney) withdraw from the case and that the continued representation by that law firm was a denial of the right of the defendant to effective counsel. County Court Judge Johnson rendered a written decision on August 24, 1976 denying the District Attorney’s motion and that decision fully considered the constitutional rights (US Const., 6th Amdt., NY Const., art I, § 6) of the defendants) to the effective assistance of counsel. Further, the trial court fully considered and applied the rationale of People v Gomberg (38 NY2d 307) to the case before it. Subsequent to the hearing before Judge Johnson, a Huntley hearing was held and at that hearing it was established that the defendant’s counsel not only represented Mancini, but had also represented the informant. In the brief on appeal this is alleged to be a surprise to defendant, and it is further alleged that defendant then sought to discharge his counsel but did not do so because he could not get back his retainer. However, the record is silent as to any ""surprise” or any dissatisfaction with counsel by this defendant. It is worthy to note the sequence of events concerning the alleged representation of counsel. The charge against the informant was dismissed on July 26, 1976. Mancini pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, fourth degree, on May 31, 1977. However, he never testified in the Manos trial as a result of which the defendant’s counsel argued that Mancini was the only seller, which argument apparently was not accepted by the jury. Any attempt to formulate a lack of effective counsel upon this record is pure speculation. The case meets all the requirements of People v Gomberg (supra) for a waiver by the defendant of any possible prejudice, which prejudice is not, in any event, apparent in this record.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered November 7, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
On October 5, 1994, two accusatory instruments were filed against defendant; one charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and the other charging him with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. After waiving indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a single charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (Penal Law § 220.31) contained in a superior court information. On appeal, defendant contends that the superior court information was jurisdictionally defective because the waiver of indictment {see, CPL 195.20) states that defendant will be charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree instead of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Our review of the record supports the People’s position that this variation was solely due to a typographical error in the waiver of indictment and defendant was on notice of the true crime to be charged (cf., People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850). Significantly, the waiver of indictment specifically refers to Penal Law § 220.31, the correct numeric citation for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Thus, both the waiver of indictment and superior court information both correctly allege a violation of Penal Law § 220.31. Notably, although the wrong statutory provision was mentioned early in the arraignment proceedings before County Court, defendant was thereafter specifically told by the court that he was being charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Moreover, although his attorney asked that the superior court information be amended to reflect the correct date, no mention was made of any error in the actual crime charged. Accordingly, we conclude that any error made was purely ministerial and nonprejudicial to defendant.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Lamont, J.), rendered July 1, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We reject defendant’s argument that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea prior to County Court’s imposition of a harsher sentence than that agreed to in the plea bargain. By fleeing to Brazil, defendant failed to honor his part of the bargain to assist the police in their drug investigations. Where, as here, a defendant fails to fulfill an explicit condition of the sentencing agreement, a sentencing court need not permit withdrawal of a guilty plea (see, People v McDaniels, 111 AD2d 876; see also, People v Ellis, 162 AD2d 701, lv denied 76 NY2d 892; People v Cuadrado, 161 AD2d 232, lv denied 76 NY2d 855). Further, defendant’s responses to questions during his plea allocution belie his claim that he had difficulty understanding his interpreter (see, People v Curet, 176 AD2d 160, lv denied 78 NY2d 1127). Finally, assuming that defendant is correct in arguing that the interpreter used during his plea allocution was not appointed in accordance with the Judiciary Law, such an irregularity does not invalidate the interpreter’s actions (see, People v Rossney, 178 AD2d 765, lv denied 79 NY2d 1007; Matter of County of Ontario v Western Finger Lakes Solid Waste Mgt.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Austin, J.), rendered June 9, 2003, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in connection with her alleged possession and sale of crack cocaine on two dates in January 2003. Additionally, a violation of probation proceeding was commenced against defendant as a result of her arrest on the aforementioned charges. After conferring with counsel, defendant agreed to accept the plea bargain offered by the People prior to the commencement of a hearing on pretrial motions. Accordingly, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived her right to appeal and, as agreed, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years upon her conviction of that crime and a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years for her admitted violation of probation.
On appeal, defendant challenges the voluntariness of her guilty plea. Although the voluntariness of defendant’s plea is not encompassed in the waiver of her right to appeal, the issue is not preserved for our review inasmuch as she did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mondore, 18 AD3d 961, 961 [2005]; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 635 [2001]), and the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as the record of defendant’s plea colloquy does not contain any statements tending to negate an element of the crime (see People v Mondore, supra at 961; People v Kemp, supra at 636). Nevertheless, were we to consider defendant’s argument, we would conclude that her plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Coffey, 18 AD3d 1028, 1029 [2005]; People v Keebler, 15 AD3d 724, 725-726 [2005]). Finally, given defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review her contention that her sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Keene, J.), rendered September 23, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a five-count indictment stemming from his possession of methamphetamine, defendant entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree under count 2 of the indictment. In accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of IV2 years followed by one year of post-release supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in that counsel failed to pursue pretrial discovery or motions and did not move to suppress the evidence against him.

Moreover, “[i]n the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Sylvan, 108 AD3d 869, 870 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1091 [2014] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under settled law, the “[f]ailure to request a suppression hearing or to make a pretrial motion does not, by itself, constitute ineffective assistance, particularly in the absence of any basis upon which to conclude that a defendant had a color-able claim or that counsel’s actions were not premised upon a legitimate strategy” (People v Vonneida, 130 AD3d 1322, 1322-1323 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1093 [Dec. 29, 2015]; see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Cooper, 126 AD3d 1046, 1047-1048 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 966 [2015]; cf. People v Carnevale, 101 AD3d 1375, 1378-1381 [2012]). Defendant assured County Court prior to the plea allocution that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel regarding the plea offer and that he was satisfied with counsel. Further, the record reflects that counsel secured a favorable plea deal and successfully argued against second felony offender sentencing. Thus, were the issue preserved, we would find that nothing in the record supports defendant’s contention that he was deprived of meaningful representation (see People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712-714 [1998]; People v Cooper, 126 AD3d at 1048).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered November 1, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in third degree. The record reveals that, prior to this plea, County Court had made a sentencing commitment that defendant refused to accept. Thereafter, County Court withdrew this offer. A subsequent arrangement was then entered into by which defendant would agree to plead guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the first and third count of the indictment charging defendant with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. This plea was conditioned on a sentencing recommendation to County Court that defendant receive an indeterminate prison sentence that would not exceed 2 to 6 years. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea arrangement to two concurrent prison terms of 2 to 6 years.
Defendant contends on appeal that County Court considered improper factors and that the sentence is harsh and excessive. The record reveals that defendant entered a knowing and voluntary guilty plea and was sentenced in accordance therewith. Defendant was given ample opportunity to reflect upon his guilty plea and the provisions of the sentence; he decided to accept all of its terms. We therefore conclude that the appeal has no merit (see, People v Masten, 215 AD2d 892, lv denied 86 NY2d 782). We also reject defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was attributable to vindictiveness (see, People v Young, 94 NY2d 171, 177).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered November 2, 2015, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in two separate superior court informations and waived the right to appeal. The plea agreement contemplated that, in lieu of sentencing, defendant would enter into the judicial diversion program and that, if she failed to complete the program, she could be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant later admitted to violating the conditions of the judicial diversion program with the understanding that she would be sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of nine years. County Court instructed defendant, however, that she must follow all the rules of county jail pending sentencing, and if she violated those rules, the court would not be bound by the agreement and that she could be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, defendant was found to have violated jail rules. At sentencing, County Court informed defendant that, based upon the rule violations, it was no longer bound to impose the agreed-upon concurrent sentences of nine years. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender, to two consecutive prison terms of nine years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. We reject defendant’s challenge to the validity of her appeal waiver. County Court explained that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea and informed defendant of the rights that survive the waiver. Defendant confirmed her understanding of the waiver and that she was voluntarily waiving the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]). Defendant also signed written waivers affirming that she had been given sufficient time to discuss the waiver of the right to appeal with counsel (see People v McKenzie, 136 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]). Accordingly, we are satisfied that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal her convictions and sentence (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Beverly, 140 AD3d 1400, 1400-1401 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]; People v Murdie, 134 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2015]). Contrary to defendant’s contention, her valid appeal waiver precludes from our review her sole remaining contention on appeal, that the imposed sentence is harsh and excessive, inasmuch as she was informed that a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison could be imposed if she violated the conditions of the plea agreement (see People v Garrow, 147 AD3d 1160, 1162 [2017]; People v Deprosperis, 132 AD3d 692, 693 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1108 [2016]; People v Lyman, 119 AD3d 968, 970 [2014], lv denied 27 NY3d 1153 [2016]).

Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Richmond County, for further proceedings in accordance herewith.
The transcript of the minutes of the guilty plea proceeding does not indicate, nor can it be implied therefrom, that the defendant was told that if he was subsequently arrested or failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing the court could impose a harsher sentence than the one to three years imprisonment which the court promised was ""[t]he worst you are looking at” in consideration of his plea of guilty. Thus, even though the defendant failed to appear for sentencing and was subsequently arrested, the sentencing court could not impose a sentence greater than that bargained for without first affording the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea and to stand trial (see, People v White, 144 AD2d 711; People v Cook, 130 AD2d 503). Accordingly, we remit the matter to the Supreme Court, Richmond County, to afford it the opportunity to either impose the promised sentence or permit the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty.

"Appeal from an adjudication of the Steuben County Court (Peter C. Bradstreet, J.), rendered September 29, 2005. Defendant was adjudicated a youthful offender upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.
It is hereby ordered that said adjudication be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed.
Memorandum: Defendant appeals from an adjudication upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 165.45 [4]). Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention with respect to the alleged impropriety of the sentence (see People v Rhymer, 3 AD3d 315, 316 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 745 [2004]; People v Holmes, 306 AD2d 889 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 621 [2003]) and, in any event, his contention is without merit. The plea agreement provided that defendant would be sentenced to “possible alternatives to incarceration, possibly community service and drug and alcohol related alternatives, along with five years probation.” Thereafter, defendant signed an agreement to enter the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Court. The agreement expressly provided that, if defendant was terminated from the program based upon unsatisfactory performance, he would be sentenced to a term of incarceration of lVs to 4 years. Thus, County Court properly sentenced defendant to a term of incarceration of lVs to 4 years when defendant failed to complete the program (see generally People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714 [2004]; People v Milner, 28 AD3d 873, 874 [2006]; Rhymer, 3 AD3d at 316).

"Appeal by the defendant from (1) a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (Berry, J.), rendered August 2, 1996, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of SVe to 9V3 years incarceration, under Indictment No. 96-00210, and (2) an amended judgment of the same court, also rendered August 2, 1996, revoking a sentence of probation previously imposed by the same court, upon a finding that he had violated a condition thereof, upon his admission, and imposing a sentence of imprisonment upon his previous conviction of assault in the second degree, under Indictment No. 94-00723.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the sentence imposed under Indictment No. 96-00210 from an indeterminate term of 3V6 to 9V3 years imprisonment to SVe to 9V3 years imprisonment; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed; and it is further,
Ordered that the amended judgment is affirmed.
Inasmuch as the defendant did not move to withdraw either his plea or admission, or to vacate either the judgment or amended judgment of conviction, he has not preserved for appellate review his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution or admission (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Claudio, 64 NY2d 858; People v Griffin, 186 AD2d 820).
Furthermore, contrary to his contention, the defendant received the effective assistance of counsel. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must overcome the presumption of effectiveness and show that counsel failed to provide meaningful representation (People v Jackson, 70 NY2d 768, 769). The defendant’s claim that shock incarceration was part of the plea agreement rests upon matters which are dehors the record and may only be raised upon a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (see, People v Lebrun, 234 AD2d 392). Additionally, the defendant does not allege that he is actually innocent of the charges to which he voluntarily pleaded guilty (see, People v Hayes, 186 AD2d 268, 269).
As the People correctly concede, the court imposed an illegal sentence of SVe to 9V3 years imprisonment under Indictment No. 96-00210. The court should have imposed a minimum term of imprisonment of one-third of the maximum term (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [b]). However, we otherwise decline to modify the sentence as we do not find it to be excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Rosenblatt, J.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (Byrne, J.), rendered October 28, 1996, convicting him of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of six years to life imprisonment.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. The defendant, upon the advice of counsel, reaped the benefit of an extremely favorable plea agreement (see, People v Paterno, 141 AD2d 771).
The sentence imposed by the County Court was less than the minimum allowable under the terms of the Penal Law (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]; § 110.05 [1]; § 220.21). Under all the circumstances of this case, including the consent of the People, we conclude that the appropriate remedy is to give effect to the intent of the parties’ plea agreement by reducing the grade of the offense upon which the defendant’s conviction is based (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]; § 220.18; People v Carter, 196 AD2d 633).

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County, rendered February 19, 1969, convicting him of petit' larceny, upon a plea of guilty, and imposing sentence of certifying him, as a narcotic addict, to the care and custody of the Narcotic. Addiction Control Commission for an indeterminate term of not more than 36 months. Judgment reversed, on the law and the facts, defendant’s plea of guilty vacated, indictment reinstated, and ease remitted to the County Court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. At the time defendant pleaded guilty, the County Court' had “ reasonable cause to believe that the defendant * * * [was] a narcotic addict” (Mental Hygiene Law, § 208, subd. 1). The court therefore had the clear duty under subdivision 1 of section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law to so notify defendant and afford him “ an opportunity to admit, deny or stand mute with respect to the issue of whether he * *• * [was or was] not a narcotic addict.” In our opinion, defendant was not so notified; nor was he given an opportunity to contest the issue. Moreover, the court abused its discretion under section 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when it refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea once he learned that the plea, when taken together with his being found to be an addict, meant that certification to the care and custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission was mandatory under subdivision 4 of section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The record seems to indicate that had defendant been cognizant, before he pleaded guilty, of the fact that such certification would thus have to follow, he might well have pleaded not guilty and gone to trial, both on the question of his commission of the crimes for which he was indicted and on the question of his addiction (under Mental Hygiene Law, § 208). This is because he apparently wanted to be sentenced to a shorter term in jail under the Penal Law, rather than certified to the care and custody of the commission for an indefinite period of up to 36 months under the Mental Hygiene Law. In these circumstances, he should be allowed to withdraw his plea. Beldoek, P. J., Christ, Munder, Martuseello and Kleinfeld, JJ., concur.",,391,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Chetta, J.), rendered December 13, 1990, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
As part of a negotiated plea agreement, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and receive a sentence of eight years to life imprisonment. At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that this crime is a class A-II felony when in fact it is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law §§ 220.43, 110.05 [1]). The promised sentence was imposed and constituted an illegally-low term of imprisonment for a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). Under the circumstances, the judgment should be modified, in the interests of justice, by reducing the conviction to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (see, Penal Law § 220.41) in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489; cf., People v Alvarez, 166 AD2d 603). Since the sentence imposed upon the defendant’s plea was the sentence promised, no purpose would be served by remitting the matter for resentencing (see, People v Laino, supra; People v Brown, supra).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court, Sullivan County rendered October 31, 1972, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree. Defendant was indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree in violation of section 220.35 of the Penal Law. Subsequently, he pied guilty to the indictment and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 4% years. He contends on this appeal that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to sentence him to prison instead of committing him to the care of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. He also maintains that section 208 (subd. 4, par. b) of the Mental Hygiene Law in granting the court discretion either to impose a jail sentence, or to certify for Narcotic Addiction Control Commission care for rehabilitation, is cruel and inhuman punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. (See People v. Davis, 33 N Y 2d 221.) Both contentions lack merit. The court was fully aware of defendant’s drug addiction problem, and the fact that he previously had received treatment. The court, in its discretion, elected to impose a jail sentence. This it was authorized to do pursuant to section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. {People v. Garter, 31 N Y 2d 964.) The statute, in our opinion, presents no constitutional defect. It properly grants discretion to the court to provide medical treatment to felons who it feels will benefit thereby, or to impose jail sentences where the interests of justice will be better served. {Smith v.

"— Appeal unanimously dismissed. Memorandum: After defendant was indicted on nine counts of drug-related activity, the court, with the People’s agreement, accepted defendant’s plea to attempted first degree criminal sale of a controlled substance in exchange for the promise of a sentence of three years to life. The parties and the court mistakenly assumed that first degree attempted criminal sale is an A-II felony. In fact, it is an A-I felony carrying a minimum sentence of 15 years to life. After the mistake was discovered but before sentencing, defendant was permitted to withdraw his plea to attempted first degree criminal sale. Defendant then asserted that he was entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement, i.e., that he was entitled to plead guilty to an A-II felony in exchange for a sentence of three years to life. The People opposed that relief, arguing that defendant was not entitled to specific performance because he had not changed his position in detrimental reliance on the plea agreement. They also withdrew their plea offer, informing the court that new information concerning defendant’s criminal activities prevented them from offering a plea to less than an A-I felony.
The court found that defendant had detrimentally relied on the plea agreement and was entitled to specific performance. Thus, without the People’s consent, the court accepted defendant’s plea to second degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and sentenced defendant to three years to life. The People now attempt to appeal from that judgment.
An appeal by the People does not lie in these circumstances. The People’s authority to appeal to an intermediate appellate court in a criminal case is strictly the product of statute (see, People v Ainsworth, 145 AD2d 74, 76, lv granted 74 NY2d 660, appeal withdrawn 74 NY2d 894; People v Garofalo, 71 AD2d 782, appeal dismissed 49 NY2d 879, adhered to on rearg 75 AD2d 980). That authority is set forth in its entirety in CPL 450.20. Because the conviction and sentence in this case is not an order, judgment, or sentence of the type enumerated in CPL 450.20, the People’s appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

"It is hereby ordered that the case is held, the decision is reserved and the matter is remitted to Onondaga County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of burglary in the third degree (Penal Law § 140.20). Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, entered into in January 2007, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of burglary, a class D felony, and was promised that, if he successfully completed a drug treatment program, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea to the felony and instead plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a promised sentence of a one-year conditional discharge. If defendant was unsuccessful in the drug treatment program, however, under the plea agreement he would be sentenced to a term of incarceration of one to three years. The record establishes that the drug treatment contract included a provision that, in order to remain enrolled in the program, defendant could not be arrested. In January 2008, defendant appeared in County Court for sentencing on the felony based upon his termination from the drug treatment program for, inter alia, his postplea arrests for other crimes. Defendant denied having been criminally involved in the crimes giving rise to his arrests and requested an opportunity to prove his innocence. Relying heavily upon the “mere fact” of defendant’s arrests (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]), the court summarily sentenced defendant to one to three years.
Initially, we agree with defendant that, even if valid, his waiver of the right to appeal does not encompass his contention that the court erred in failing to conduct an inquiry to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for defendant’s termination from the drug treatment program (see People v Huggins, 45 AD3d 1380 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1006 [2007]; see also People v Fiammegta, 14 NY3d 90 [2010]). We further agree with defendant that the court erred in failing to “carry out an inquiry of sufficient depth to satisfy itself that there was a legitimate basis” for defendant’s termination from the drug treatment program (Fiammegta, 14 NY3d at 98), including whether the postplea arrests were “without foundation” (Outley, 80 NY2d at 713). Because defendant served his sentence of incarceration, the only remedy available to him is to be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty to a felony and to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. We therefore hold the case, reserve decision, and remit the matter to County Court to conduct an inquiry to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for defendant’s termination from the drug treatment program, including whether defendant’s postplea arrests were without foundation.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Westchester County (West, J.), rendered January 4, 1988, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to a term of six months imprisonment, five years probation, and payment of $320 in restitution to the Port Chester Police Department.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof which directed the defendant to pay $320 in restitution; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s appellate counsel has filed an Anders brief (see, Anders v California, 386 US 738). We have reviewed the record and find the presence of one nonfrivolous issue for which the People can have no possible response. The sentencing court ordered the defendant to make restitution to the Port Chester Police Department for unrecovered ""buy money” expended by it during 1986 drug sales which resulted in the defendant’s arrest, and his subsequent conviction in 1988. However, the imposition of restitution was clearly improper since it is well settled that the Police Department, in this instance, was not considered a ""victim” of a crime, pursuant to Penal Law § 60.27, to whom restitution may be made (People v Rowe, 152 AD2d 907, affd 75 NY2d 948; People v Woods, 177 AD2d 731). We note that Penal Law § 60.27 was amended effective November 1, 1991, to authorize restitution to law enforcement agencies for unrecovered funds used in the purchase of drugs as part of investigations leading to convictions (see, Penal Law § 60.27 [9]).
Accordingly, rather than waste precious resources in, inter alia, assigning new counsel to assert this issue (cf, People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606), we have modified the judgment to the extent indicated. Counsel’s application for leave to withdraw as counsel is granted (see, Anders v California, 386 US 738, supra; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631). Mangano, P.

"Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Suffolk County (Braslow, J.), both rendered May 16, 2006, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 01703/05, and burglary in the third degree under Superior Court information No. 02115/05, upon his pleas of guilty, and sentencing him to a determinate term of imprisonment of eight years plus three years of postrelease supervision upon the conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years upon the conviction of burglary in the third degree, both sentences to run consecutively.
Ordered that the judgments are modified, on the law, by vacating the sentences imposed; as so modified, the judgments are affirmed, and the matters are remitted to the County Court, Suffolk County, for further proceedings in accordance herewith.
The defendant was convicted, upon his pleas of guilty, of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and burglary in the third degree. The County Court promised the defendant a sentence consisting of a determinate 21/2-year term of imprisonment plus a two-year period of post-release supervision on the conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (hereinafter the controlled substance conviction), and a concurrent indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years on the conviction of burglary in the third degree (hereinafter the burglary conviction). The court advised the defendant, inter alia, that if he failed to appear for sentencing, he would be sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment of eight years on the controlled substance conviction, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on the burglary conviction, but it did not advise the defendant that the postrelease supervision component of the sentence would be enhanced. After the defendant failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing and was returned on a warrant, the County Court imposed the determinate term of imprisonment of eight years plus a three-year period of post-release supervision with respect to the controlled substance conviction, and an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years with respect to the burglary conviction, to run consecutively.
In exchange for his pleas of guilty, the defendant was promised that his sentence on the controlled substance conviction would consist of a 2V2-year term of imprisonment plus a two-year period of postrelease supervision, and that if he failed to appear for sentencing, the imprisonment component of the sentence would be increased to eight years, and would run consecutively to the sentence imposed on the burglary conviction. Since, in addition to the promised enhancements, the postrelease supervision component of that sentence was increased from two years to three years, the defendant did not receive the bargained-for sentence.
Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on the controlled substance conviction, as well as the inextricably intertwined sentence imposed on the burglary conviction, and remit the matter to the County Court, Suffolk County, to allow the County Court to (1) impose the promised sentences, which, in light of the defendant’s failure to appear for sentencing, consist of a determinate term of imprisonment of eight years, plus a two-year period of postrelease supervision on the controlled substance conviction, and an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 2 to 4 years on the burglary conviction, to run consecutively, (2) afford the defendant the opportunity to accept the previously-imposed sentences, including the enhanced period of postrelease supervision, or, (3) in the absence of either of those results, permit the defendant to withdraw his pleas of guilty (see People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Rossetti, 55 AD3d 637 [2008]; People v Kegel, 55 AD3d 625 [2008]; People v Rubendall, 4 AD3d 13, 20 [2004]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Maraño, J.), rendered July 15, 1984, convicting him of criminal. sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. The appeal brings up for review the denial (Egitto, J.), after a hearing, of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
Prior to sentencing, the defendant moved to withdraw his plea of guilty predicated upon a misunderstanding of the plea bargain agreement. He thought he would not have to serve any additional period of incarceration, but would be immediately released on parole, because the credit for time served on a previous conviction that had been reversed on appeal satisfied the minimum term of promised sentence.
At the time the defendant pleaded guilty, the court promised to impose a sentence of one-year-to-life imprisonment and to resentence the defendant, upon an application pursuant to Penal Law § 60.09, to an indeterminate sentence of 1 to 3 years’ incarceration. The court also advised the defendant that it had no objection to defense counsel applying to the Division of Parole for permission to have the defendant immediately released on parole, in view of the fact the defendant had served approximately 19 months on a prior reversed conviction, and would accord defense counsel sufficient time to make the application. At the hearing on the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, both the defendant and his counsel admitted that the court never promised the defendant that he would not have to serve any period of incarceration. Since an objective reading of the plea bargain agreement was susceptible to but one interpretation, the defendant’s misunderstanding of the agreement, or disappointment upon discovering that the Parole Board would require his incarceration for a period of time, does not suffice as a reason for permitting him to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Cataldo, 39 NY2d 578; People v Latine, 71 AD2d 697).

"—Judgment unanimously modified as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice and as modified affirmed in accordance with the following Memorandum: County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to an additional 6V2 to 13 years in prison because he failed to appear for sentencing after pleading guilty to criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (Penal Law § 220.50 [2]) and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.16 [1], [12]). When it accepted the plea and released defendant from custody pending sentencing, the court informed defendant that it would impose a term of incarceration of I2V2 to 25 years if defendant did not return, and it does not appear that the court gave due consideration to the appropriate sentencing factors when it fulfilled that commitment (see, People v Nicholson, 237 AD2d 973, lv denied 90 NY2d 908). The additional prison time based upon defendant’s failure to appear exceeds the sentence for bail jumping in the first degree (Penal Law § 215.57). In our view, the sentence of 12V2 to 25 years imposed upon the conviction of two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree is unduly harsh. We exercise our discretion in the interest of justice to reduce the sentence on those counts to concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 7 to 14 years. We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit.

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Westchester County (West, J.), rendered July 8, 1987, convicting him of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
We find that, pursuant to the plea bargain negotiations, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to an A-II felony under indictment No. 87-00105, the top count of which was criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, an A-I felony. In accordance with this agreement, the court promised to sentence defendant to a term of six years’ to life imprisonment. In entering the plea, the defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 110.05 [1]). Thereafter, the court imposed a sentence of six years to life in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.
We modify the judgment of conviction, in the interest of justice, by reducing it to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, an A-II felony (see, Penal Law § 220.18), in order to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement. Since the sentence imposed upon the defendant’s plea was the sentence promised, there is no purpose to be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence (see, People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743).
We find that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel since defense counsel’s mistaken belief that attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree is an A-II felony does not rise to the level of ineffectiveness (see, People v Baldi, 54 AD2d 137).
We have examined the remaining issues raised by the defendant and find them to be either unpreserved for,appellate review or without merit (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

Memorandum: Under the circumstances of this case, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant youthful offender treatment, and we decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to grant such treatment (see, People v Parker, 222 AD2d 1122; People v Gaziano [appeal No. 1], 219 AD2d 870; cf., People v Shrubsall, 167 AD2d 929, 930). Furthermore, we conclude that the imposition of an indeterminate term of incarceration of 2 to 4 years upon defendant’s conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony, is neither unduly harsh nor severe (see, CPL 470.15 [6] [b]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Rohl, J.), rendered August 18, 1989, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, for dismissal of Indictment Numbers 1677/88 and 1678/88.
After entering his plea of guilty in the instant matter, the defendant requested that he be released on his own recognizance for two weeks prior to sentencing. The court acceded to this request, informing him that should he fail to appear in court on the scheduled date, an increased sentence of IVz to 15 years imprisonment would be imposed in lieu of the bargained-for sentence of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The defendant indicated that he understood the terms of this condition and he consented to it.
Having failed to return to court on the appointed date, the defendant was subsequently arrested on a bench warrant. Thereafter, at sentencing, the court imposed the promised increased sentence of 7 Vz to 15 years imprisonment.
Since the defendant failed to fulfill a condition underlying the sentence agreement, namely, that he return to court at the conclusion of his two-week release, the court was no longer bound by its original sentence promise and had the right to impose a greater sentence upon the defendant’s violation of the agreed-upon conditions (see, People v Warren, 121 AD2d 418; see also, People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917, 918). Additionally, since the promise of an increased sentence was part of the original plea agreement, the defendant has no cause to complain that the sentence imposed is excessive (see, People v Winston, 114 AD2d 918; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816, 817; see also, People v Perkins, 130 AD2d 521, 522).
Upon our review of the minutes of the plea proceedings, we find that the dismissal of Indictment Numbers 1677/88 and 1678/88 was part of the original plea bargain and that it was error for the court to fail to dismiss those indictments at sentencing. Accordingly, the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, for dismissal of those indictments. Mangano, P.

"Judgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed and matter remitted to Onondaga County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following Memorandum: In exchange for defendant’s plea of guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a pending indictment, County Court agreed to impose a sentence of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years. The court warned defendant that, if he was arrested on new charges while on release pending sentencing, the court’s sentencing promise of 1 to 3 years would no longer stand and defendant could be sentenced to 5 to 15 years. Defendant agreed and his plea of guilty was accepted. While on release pending sentencing, defendant was arrested on a new charge of robbery in the first degree. The court satisfied itself that there was a basis for the arrest (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702), and, after denying the request of defendant to withdraw his plea, sentenced defendant to 7 to 21 years.
Before imposing a harsher sentence than that agreed upon, the court must offer defendant an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. Although the court could impose an enhanced sentence upon defendant’s arrest on new charges prior to sentencing, it could not impose an enhanced sentence higher than 5 to 15 years without providing defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Thus, we modify the judgment on appeal by vacating the sentence, and we remit the matter to Onondaga County Court to impose the sentence promised or to afford defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea (see, People v Thomas, 210 AD2d 902; People v Scerbo, 197 AD2d 885, 886; People v Williams, 195 AD2d 1040, 1041).

On this appeal he contends the sentence was harsh and excessive since lifetime probation should have been imposed as an alternative owing to his material assistance in the investigation and apprehension of other drug offenders (Penal Law, § 65.00, subd 1, par [b]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Monroe, J.), rendered January 9, 1981, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of bail jumping in the first degree. Originally convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree and bail jumping in the first degree, defendant obtained a reversal of those convictions upon appeal to this court (74 AD2d 700). The indictment charging criminal possession was dismissed while the bail jumping charge was remitted to the County Court for further proceedings. Defendant now appeals from his subsequent conviction for bail jumping and argues that the dismissal of the underlying criminal possession of a controlled substance charge nullifies the bail jumping charge. We disagree. The crime of bail jumping is committed when á person who is released by court order upon bail or his own recognizance fails to make a scheduled court appearance within a specified period of time (see Penal Law, §§ 215.56, 215.57). As such, it is a crime separate and distinct from the predicate charge which gave rise to the bail jumping offense. Defendant’s ultimate success on the predicate charge does not in any way excuse or justify his failure to obey a court order directing his appearance in connection therewith (see People v Minefee, 14 111 App 3d 796). Defendant’s other contentions have been examined and found to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P.

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County, rendered March 22, 1971, convicting him of robbery in the second degree, upon a plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment not to exceed seven years. Judgment reversed on the law, and ease remitted to the Criminal Term for resentenee in accordance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Defendant was charged with a felony and appeared to be addicted to heroin (see Mental Hygiene Law, § 207). "" Accordingly, he could not be sentenced until there was compliance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law which require, inter alia, that the court order a physical examination to determine if defendant is an addict and have the report of the examination before it prior to rendering judgment ” (People v. Largue, 38 A D 2d 833; People v. Sczerbaty, 37 A D 2d 428; People v. Odom, 32 A D 2d 651; People ex rel. Ali v. La Vallee, 36 AD 2d 140; People v. Rosser, 36 A D 2d 35; People v. Woodward, 36 A D 2d 1018; People v. Smith, 37 A D 2d 798). In addition, defendant is entitled to the opportunity to admit, deny or stand mute on the issue of addiction (Mental Hygiene Law, § 208, subd. 1; People v. Roston, 37 A D 2d 624). Martuseello, Acting P. J., Latham, Christ and Brennan, JJ., concur; Benjamin, J., dissents in the following memorandum: I see no point in reversing and remitting for resentenee because of technical noncompliance with Mental Hygiene Law (§§ 207, 208), since that would merely put defendant into a revolving door and he would come out in exactly the same place. At a Huntley hearing held before defendant pleaded guilty, he testified that he was a drug addict. When he pleaded guilty (before the same Judge who had held the Huntley hearing), the Judge indicated that he would impose a jail sentence. At sentencing (before the same Judge), defense counsel said that defendant had a drug problem and that he should get as short a jail sentence as possible; he did not request NACC. The probation report shows that defendant was examined in the Nassau County Jail and certified as an addict three months before he pleaded guilty. That report also shows that defendant had a long record of burglaries, larcenies, drugs and robbery; and that he had previously tried civil drug centers in New York and California, but they had not helped him. Defendant’s brief on appeal does not contend that sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law, were not complied with; it merely argues that NACC would have been more appropriate than a jail sentence, and thus concedes that he is an addict. It is clear from this record that at the time of sentence everyone (the court, prosecutor, defense counsel and defendant) knew that defendant was an addict and was being sent to jail, not NACC, despite that fact; and that defendant acquiesced in that type of sentence, and did not request NACC, but merely asked that it be a shorter jail sentence. It is also clear that the jail sentence, instead of NACC, was a proper exercise of the court’s discretion, in view of defendant’s record and previous lack of success with civil drug centers; and there is ample material in this record (colloquies at plea and sentence, and the probation report) for a review by us of that exercise of discretion. In light of these facts, I see no point in remitting for resentence, so that defendant can again concede that he is an addict and the court can again impose the same jail term as it did originally. In the recent ease of People v. Crafton (38 A D 2d 833), we were confronted with the same situation as in the present ease; by a 4 to 1 vote (Shapiro, Gulotta, Christ, Benjamin, JJ.; Martuscello, Acting P. J., dissenting) we affirmed the judgment on the theory that the defendant had already admitted his addiction and had, in effect, waived his right under section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law to dispute a report finding him addicted. We should do the same here, namely, affirm the judgment.",,726,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered March 21, 1995, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of 20 years to life imprisonment on each conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and each conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, and an indeterminate term of SVs to 25 years imprisonment on the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, with the sentences imposed for the first conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (count one) and the first conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count two) to run concurrently with each other and consecutive to the sentences imposed for the second convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (count three) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (count four), which run concurrently with each other and consecutive to the sentences imposed for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered July 24, 1991, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
After entering his plea of guilty, the defendant requested that he be released on his own recognizance pending sentence. The court granted the request, explicitly warning the defendant that should he fail to appear on the scheduled date for sentencing, an increased sentence of 1V¿ to 15 years imprisonment would be imposed in lieu of the bargained-for sentence of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The defendant indicated that he understood these terms.
The defendant failed to return to court on the appointed date, and he was subsequently arrested on a bench warrant. Thereafter, the court imposed the sentence of IV2 to 15 years imprisonment.
Since the defendant failed to fulfill a condition underlying the sentence agreement by failing to return to court for sentencing, the court was no longer bound by its original sentence promise and had the right to impose a greater sentence (see, People v Miller, 170 AD2d 464; People v Warren, 121 AD2d 418). Additionally, since the promise of an increased sentence was part of the original plea agreement, the defendant has no cause to complain that the sentence imposed is excessive (see, People v Miller, supra; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

"Appeal from judgments, Supreme Court, New York County (Laura A. Ward, J.), rendered November 14, 2012, convicting defendant, upon his pleas of guilty, of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and sentencing him to concurrent terms of 5V2 years and 6 years, respectively, held in abeyance, and the matter remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.
As the People concede, the court failed to warn defendant of the potential for deportation during the 2002 plea proceeding (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 176 [2013], cert denied sub nom. Thomas v New York, 574 US —, 135 S Ct 90 [2014]). At the 2005 plea proceeding, which addressed the 2002 and 2005 cases after defendant had absconded before the scheduled sentencing on his 2002 conviction, the court did raise the issue of deportation. However, defendant was deprived of effective assistance when his counsel undermined the court’s warning and understated the potential for deportation by remarking that the plea would “not necessarily” result in deportation, and that defendant only “might be deported” (see People v Hemans, 132 AD3d 428 [1st Dept 2015]). In fact, it was clear that defendant’s plea of guilty to an aggravated felony triggered mandatory deportation under federal law (see 8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [A] [iii]).
Defendant should be afforded the opportunity to move to vacate his plea upon a showing that there is a “reasonable probability” that he would not have pleaded guilty had he been made aware of the deportation consequences of his plea (see Peque, 22 NY3d at 199-200; see also People v Chacko, 99 AD3d 527 [1st Dept 2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1060 [2013]). Accordingly, we remit for the remedy set forth in Peque (22 NY3d at 200-201), and hold the appeal in abeyance for that purpose.
We have considered and rejected the People’s arguments that defendant was required to preserve his claims concerning potential deportation, that the ineffective assistance claim is unreviewable, and that defendant’s claims are barred by his misconduct in absconding. We also reject defendant’s claim that he is entitled to outright reversal of the judgment on a separate ground of involuntariness. Although defendant received erroneous information as to his potential sentence in the event he violated the conditions of the plea agreement, this reference to a sentence greater than the maximum legally permissible term could not have “induced” him to plead guilty (People v Monroe, 21 NY3d 875, 878 [2013]).

"— Judgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed and matter remitted to Cayuga County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following Memorandum: The People concede that defendant was denied his right to allocution at sentencing and thus that the matter must be remitted to County Court so that defendant may be resentenced.
There is no merit to defendant’s argument that the court was required to adhere to its original sentence promise. Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. He was allowed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, for which he could have received a sentence of up to 15 years in State prison. He was promised a one-year sentence in the County Jail. The court was aware that defendant had previously been adjudicated a youthful offender. After receiving the presentence investigation, the court stated that it could not adhere to the agreement because of appellant’s record, attitude and crime. Defendant was given the opportunity to withdraw his plea and go to trial or to let the plea stand and receive a sentence of one to four years incarceration. The presentence investigation indicates that defendant, when questioned about his involvement in the offense to which he pled guilty, made no comment other than to tell the probation officer that the offense was ""a bunch of shit.” The court did not err in refusing to carry out its initial promise under those circumstances, where the presentence investigation revealed new information concerning defendant’s attitude (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122; People v Jones, 99 AD2d 1, 3-4; see also, People v Carner, 142 AD2d 789, lv denied 72 NY2d 955; People v Powers, 134 AD2d 736).

"Appeals by defendant from (1) a judgment of the County Court, Orange County, rendered September 1, 1971, convicting him of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree, upon a plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term not to exceed four years, and (2) an order of the same court, dated February 26, 1973, denying his motion to set aside said judgment, for leave to withdraw the guilty plea, to dismiss the indictment and for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Mr. Justice Munder grants defendant leave for the appeal he has taken from the order (CPL 450.15, 460.15). Order affirmed. No opinion. Judgment reversed, on the law, and case remanded to the County Court for resentencing. At the time defendant was sentenced, the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission was not accepting any criminal addicts for treatment. The record is' not clear whether, in view of this fact, the sentencing court considered the alternate sentencing provisions available under the Penal Law (People v. Bennet, 39 A D 2d 320). In remanding the case we are in no way indicating what sentence should be imposed (see People v. Laing, 40 A D 2d 709). This case is distinguishable from People v. Carter (31 N Y 2d 964), because, although the record in this case demonstrates that defendant was addicted, it does not make clear whether the court considered his request for treatment or the possibility of a conditional or unconditional discharge.

"Appeal by the People from a sentence of the County Court, Rockland County (Resnik, J.), imposed March 22, 2005, upon the defendant’s conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon his plea of guilty, the sentence being four concurrent determinate terms of 3V2 years, to be followed by a three-year period of postrelease supervision.
Ordered that the sentence is reversed, on the law, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, for resentencing in accordance herewith.
The defendant committed the crimes to which he pleaded guilty before January 13, 2005, the effective date of the Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738; hereinafter DLRA), but was sentenced after January 13, 2005, the effective date of the statute. On February 8, 2005 the defendant entered a plea of guilty to four drug-related offenses, based on the understanding that he would be sentenced under the DLRA to four concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 3V2 years. The People declined to participate in the plea bargain, contending that, under the law in effect at the time the crimes were committed, the minimum legal sentence would be an indeterminate term of imprisonment of four and one-half to nine years. On March 22, 2005 the County Court sentenced the defendant in accordance with the promise made at the time of his plea of guilty.
For the reasons set forth in People v Goode (25 AD3d 723 [2006]), the sentence imposed upon the defendant was invalid as a matter of law, and the defendant must be resentenced under the law applicable at the time of the commission of the offenses (see People v Torres, 26 AD3d 398 [2006]; People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005], lv granted 6 NY3d 757 [2005]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Rockland County (Apotheker, J.), rendered February 10, 2014, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to a determinate term of imprisonment of three years plus three years of postrelease supervision.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating the period of postrelease supervision; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, for resentencing in accordance herewith.
Contrary to the People’s contention, since the County Court’s colloquy with the defendant suggested that the right to appeal is automatically extinguished upon the entry of a plea of guilty, the defendant’s purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid (see People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 892-893 [2006]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; People v Bennett, 115 AD3d 973, 973 [2014]; People v Jacob, 94 AD3d 1142, 1143-1144 [2012]; People v Mayo, 77 AD3d 683, 683-684 [2010]) and does not preclude review of his claim that the sentence imposed was excessive. Moreover, even a valid waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude this Court from reviewing the defendant’s further contention that the sentence was illegal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255).
Upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, the defendant was sentenced, inter alia, to a period of postrelease supervision of three years. Under Penal Law § 70.45 (2) (b), the period of postrelease supervision applicable to a sentence imposed pursuant to Penal Law § 70.70 (2) for a conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree must be between one and two years. Therefore, the period of postrelease supervision imposed was illegal.
The remainder of the defendant’s sentence was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).
Accordingly, we vacate the period of postrelease supervision imposed upon the defendant’s conviction and remit the matter to the County Court, Rockland County, for resentencing to a proper period of postrelease supervision in accordance with Penal Law § 70.45 (2) (b).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County, rendered February 3, 1976, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a dangerous substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of not more than four years, said sentence to run concurrently with a previously imposed sentence in Tioga County for like charges. Defendant contends that failure of the sentencing court in Tompkins County to order a medical examination to determine whether he was a narcotic addict and to consider committing him to custody as an alternative to sentencing him to jail requires remand for sentencing in accordance with sections 81.19 and 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The only purpose of such a medical examination is to determine whether a defendant is an addict. Where, as here, the court had a presentence probation report and an evaluation report of the Office of Drug Abuse Services articulating the defendant’s addiction, and determines that a sentence to a penal institution is called for, there is no necessity for such an examination and literal compliance with sections 81.19 and 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law is not required (People v Cicale, 35 NY2d 661; People v Carter, 31 NY2d 964; People v Butts, 40 AD2d 637). In any event, defendant was not eligible to be sentenced to probation under the care of a State health facility since at the time of sentencing he was subject to an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment imposed by another court, which sentence had more than one year to run (Penal Law, § 65.00, subd 1, par [b]).

Ordered that the order dated September 22, 2014, is reversed, on the law and as a matter of discretion, the order dated January 29, 2015, is vacated, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for a hearing and a new determination thereafter of the defendant’s motion; and it is further,
Ordered that the appeal from the order dated January 29, 2015, is dismissed as academic in light of our determination of the appeal from the order dated September 22, 2014.
The defendant is an immigrant from Colombia who has resided in the United States since 1994, when he was approximately 18 years old. On March 28, 1994, he obtained permanent resident status through his parents.
In 2002, the defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and certain lesser included offenses. On February 14, 2003, he pleaded guilty to a single count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, in satisfaction of Queens County superior court information No. 10034/03. At the plea proceeding, the defendant was represented by attorney Phillip Middler, who was handling the case for the defendant’s attorney, William Ezersky. The Supreme Court asked defense counsel, “Is there any issue as to deportation of your client as a result of this?” Defense counsel replied, “There’s a possibility of that, Judge.” The court then asked, “He still wants the plea despite that issue?” and defense counsel replied, “Yes.” The court asked, “Counsel, have you discussed these matters with your client?” and defense counsel replied, ‘Yes.”
The defendant was promised a sentence of probation for a period of five years, with a condition that he complete a certain program. He was also advised that his driver license privileges would be suspended. He waived his right to appeal. On April 24, 2003, the promised sentence was imposed, and the defendant did not appeal from the judgment of conviction.
On July 31, 2012, the defendant applied to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for United States citizenship. On July 2, 2013, his application was denied on the ground that the offense of which he had been convicted, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was an aggravated felony as defined in 8 USC § 1101 (a) (43). Thus, as a matter of law, the conviction had rendered him permanently ineligible for naturalization. Thereafter, the United States Department of Homeland Security commenced a removal proceeding against him, and he was taken into custody and held in a facility operated by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit of the Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter ICE) in New Jersey while he awaited mandatory deportation.
On or about July 3, 2014, the defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his judgment of conviction, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the entry of his plea of guilty. The defendant claimed, in an affidavit, that his attorney never advised him that he would be subject to mandatory deportation if he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Rather, he allegedly was advised that “it was only possible” that he would be deported as a result of his conviction. He claimed he never would have pleaded guilty if he had known the true immigration consequences. He alleged that he “was not guilty of the sale that I was accused of, but rather, only pled guilty because my attorney told me that it was the only way to avoid going to jail for a prolonged period of time, and because, he said I would have a chance to prevail if Immigration tried to deport me.” The defendant’s attorney on the motion submitted an affirmation stating that he spoke to Middler, the attorney who appeared on behalf of the defendant at the plea proceeding, and asked Middler to submit an affirmation in support of the motion. However, Middler did not return defense counsel’s subsequent messages, and defense counsel was therefore unable to obtain an affirmation from Middler.
By order dated September 22, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the defendant’s motion. The court, citing People v Argueta (46 AD3d 46 [2007]), reasoned that the defendant’s allegation that his attorney advised him that deportation was merely possible rather than mandatory — even if true — was not an affirmative misrepresentation and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also determined that the defendant’s claims were supported solely by his “self-serving” allegations, without an affidavit from his former attorney concerning the advice that he actually received as to the immigration consequences of his plea of guilty.
On or about November 3, 2014, the defendant, represented by new counsel, moved, in effect, to renew his motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. His attorney on this motion stated in his affirmation that he contacted the defendant’s original attorney for the criminal proceeding, William Ezersky, about the advice Ezersky gave the defendant, and was informed that Ezersky no longer had a file on the case, and had no memory of the case. In an affidavit, the defendant claimed that Ezersky advised him, on the morning of the day he pleaded guilty, that people in his position are rarely deported, and if the defendant were “put in proceedings, [he] would have a good chance of not getting deported.” By order dated January 29, 2015, the Supreme Court denied the motion. Citing CPL 440.10 (3) (b) and (c), the court concluded that the issue raised was previously determined against the defendant on the merits, and the defendant could have raised all grounds or issues in his prior motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. The defendant appeals, by permission, from the orders dated September 22, 2014, and January 29, 2015.
CPL 440.10 provides that the court “must” deny a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction when the ground or issue raised was previously determined on the merits on appeal from the judgment, or there were sufficient facts in the record which would have permitted appellate review of the issue on direct appeal, but no review occurred owing to the defendant’s unjustifiable failure to perfect a direct appeal, or raise the issue on direct appeal (CPL 440.10 [2] [a], [c]; see People u Hamilton, 115 AD3d 12, 20 [2014]). In this case, there was no appeal from the judgment, and the claims supporting the defendant’s motions involve matter both on and off the record. Therefore, the proper procedural course for the defendant was a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (see People v Diallo, 113 AD3d 199 [2013]; People v Maxwell, 89 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2011]).
A defendant seeking to vacate a judgment of conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel need not submit an affidavit or affirmation from his or her former attorney attesting to counsel’s ineffectiveness (see People v Radcliffe, 298 AD2d 533, 534-535 [2002]; accord People v Washington, 128 AD3d 1397, 1399 [2015]). Moreover, here, the defendant submitted an explanation for his failure to submit affirmations from his former attorneys (see People v Morales, 58 NY2d 1008, 1009 [1983]), and some support for the defendant’s allegations may be found in Middler’s statement on the record at the plea proceeding indicating that deportation was only a “possibility.”
In Padilla v Kentucky (559 US 356 [2010]), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires criminal defense counsel to advise their noncitizen clients about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea. However, that decision is not applied retroactively to state court postconviction proceedings (see People v Baret, 23 NY3d 777, 781 [2014]). Since the defendant’s judgment of conviction became final when his time to take an appeal expired — long before Padilla was decided in 2010 — Padilla is not applicable here. Therefore, “counsel’s failure to warn a defendant that a guilty plea might lead to removal from the United States” (People v Baret, 23 NY3d at 785) does not, in this case, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.
However, “inaccurate advice about a guilty plea’s immigration consequences constitute[s]” ineffective assistance of counsel (id.; see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 111 [2003]). In McDonald, the defendant was advised that his conviction, upon his plea of guilty, would not result in his deportation (see id. at 115). Here, the defendant allegedly was advised that his conviction carried the “possibility” of deportation, and the Supreme Court, citing People v Argueta (46 AD3d 46 [2007]), concluded that this advice did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. In Argueta, the defendant’s plea of guilty to possession of cocaine, while not an aggravated felony in and of itself, became an aggravated felony because of the defendant’s prior record. Counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness in that case was his failure to “quantify the possibility or likelihood of deportation” (id. at 49), which he was not required to do. In this case, on the other hand, deportation was mandatory at the time the defendant entered his plea of guilty based upon the offense itself (see 8 USC § 1101 [a] [43]).
In People v Galan (116 AD3d 787 [2014]), as in this case, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and was sentenced to a period of probation of five years. In 2010, the defendant was arrested on an unrelated charge, and ICE initiated removal proceedings on the ground that the crime was a deportable offense. At a hearing on the defendant’s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction, the defendant’s former attorney testified that, in accordance with her general practice at the time, “she would have advised the defendant that he would be subject to deportation as a result of his guilty plea to a drug-related offense” (id. at 789). This Court ruled that the defendant’s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction should have been denied. In this case, on the other hand, the defendant claims he was advised that deportation was not likely, and no evidence was submitted to refute that claim.
In order to secure the vacatur of his judgment of conviction, the defendant must establish that there was “a reasonable probability that, if counsel had informed him that he was certain to be deported as a result of his guilty plea, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial” (People v Hernandez, 22 NY3d 972, 976 [2013]). Here, in addition to making the foregoing assertions in support of his motion, the defendant further claimed that if immigration consequences had been factored into the plea bargaining process, counsel might have been able to negotiate a different plea agreement that would not have resulted in automatic deportation (see People v Chacko, 99 AD3d 527, 527-528 [2012]). For example, if the defendant had pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, he would not have been subject to mandatory deportation (see Aguirre v Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 79 F3d 315 [1996]).
In view of the foregoing, the defendant sufficiently alleged that counsel provided incorrect information concerning the deportation consequences of his plea of guilty, and that he was prejudiced by counsel’s conduct, to warrant a hearing. Accordingly, the matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for a hearing (see People v Ricketts-Simpson, 130 AD3d 1149 [2015]; People v Reynoso, 88 AD3d 1162 [2011]) and a new determination thereafter of the defendant’s motion to vacate the judgment of conviction.

"Appeals by the de fendant from two judgments of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), both rendered April 8, 2015, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 34/14, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 119/14, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the record indicates that the County Court fulfilled its duty to inquire further when the defendant made certain statements at the plea allocutions which may have cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of the pleas (see People v Mox, 20 NY3d 936, 938 [2012]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). Furthermore, the record as a whole, which includes extensive inquiry by the court, affirmatively demonstrates that the defendant entered his pleas of guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382-383 [2015]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 19 [1983]).
The defendant’s contention that his pleas were involuntary to the extent that he purportedly agreed to forfeit certain cash and cellular phones is unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726 [1995]; People v McNair, 79 AD3d 908, 909 [2010]). In any event, the People’s request that the defendant forfeit the subject property was a collateral, not a direct, consequence of his pleas of guilty (see People v Coleman, 138 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2016]; People v McNair, 79 AD3d at 909), and the County Court “generally has no obligation to apprise the defendant of the collateral consequences of the plea” (People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 184 [2013]; see People v Gravino, 14 NY3d 546, 553 [2010]; People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]). Moreover, the record shows that the defendant was apprised that the subject forfeitures were part of the plea agreement at the time of each plea and that he agreed to forfeit the property as part of each respective plea agreement {see CPL 220.50 [6]; People v Carmichael, 123 AD3d 1053 [2014]).

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Minardo, J.), rendered May 28, 1997, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of four and one-half to nine years imprisonment.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the sentence from an indeterminate term of four and one-half to nine years imprisonment to one of three to six years imprisonment; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
At his plea, the defendant was promised a sentence of three to six years imprisonment, and was then released on his own recognizance pending sentence. Thereafter, the People received information that the defendant intended to flee, and he was returned on a bench warrant and appeared for sentencing on the scheduled sentencing date. Upon finding that there was evidence that the defendant had intended to flee, the Supreme Court imposed an enhanced sentence of four and one-half to nine years imprisonment, without giving the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.
We reject the defendant’s contention that the plea agreement was not conditiotied upon his returning for sentencing. The condition to return for sentencing can be fairly implied from the court’s promise (cf., People v Moreno, 196 AD2d 850; People v White, 144 AD2d 711). However, without deciding the issue of whether the defendant’s mere intent to breach a plea agreement is a sufficient reason for the court to impose an enhanced sentence, we find that the evidence that the defendant intended to flee was inadequate. Thus, the defendant is entitled to his original bargain (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122; People v McKinney, 215 AD2d 407; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709). Ritter, J.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Kron, J.), rendered June 3, 2005, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to concurrent indeterminate terms of 4V2 to 9 years’ imprisonment upon each conviction.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by reducing the conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and by reducing the sentence imposed thereon from an indeterminate term of 472 to 9 years’ imprisonment to a determinate term of one year imprisonment, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on the conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that his post-plea arrest did not constitute a violation of his plea agreement and that the court, therefore, erred in imposing an enhanced sentence, is unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636, 637 [1983]; People v Lent, 10 AD3d 457 [2004]; People v Owens, 294 AD2d 603 [2002]). In any event, the record demonstrates that the defendant violated the unambiguous condition of the plea agreement that he complete the residential drug treatment program. Based on that violation, the court properly imposed the promised enhanced sentence for the defendant’s conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (see People v Benn, 23 AD3d 574, 574-575 [2005]; People v Guerra, 291 AD2d 410, 411 [2002]; People v Miles, 268 AD2d 489, 490 [2000]).
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, he was not entitled to be sentenced under the Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738; People v Aviles, 29 AD3d 813 [2006]; People v McCray, 27 AD3d 486 [2006]; People v Torres, 26 AD3d 398 [2006]).
As correctly conceded by the People, the defendant’s conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree must be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, to comport with his guilty plea. Moreover, as agreed by the defendant and the People, the sentence for that conviction should be reduced to a determinate term of one year, to run concurrently with the sentence for his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

"Appeal by defendant (1) from a judgment of the County Court, Hassau County, rendered January 18, 1972 (under indictment Ho. 29930/70), convicting him of four counts of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him on each of the four counts to an indeterminate prison term not to exceed seven years, the sentences to run concurrently, and, (2) as limited by his brief, from a sentence of the same court (under indictment Ho. 31478/71), rendered the same day, to an indeterminate prison term not to exceed five years, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed under indictment Ho. 29930/70, upon a conyiction of attempted criminally selling a dangerous drag in the third degree, on a guilty plea. Both judgments reversed with respect to the sentences, on the law, and cases remanded to the County Court for resentencing in accordance with the views set forth herein. At the time of sentence the court noted that defendant had been found to be a narcotic addict, following an examination pursuant to section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law, but that the Harcotic Addiction Control Commission (“HACC”) would not accept him. The court then stated: “ [C]ensequently, I am limited to a sentence under the Penal Law” and thereafter sentenced him under each of the two indictments to indeterminate concurrent sentences, the longest of which was seven years. The sentences were imposed prior to our determination in People v. Bennet (39 A D 2d 320, 326), in which we said “ when HACC is forced by financial pressures to refrain from carrying out the manifest and salutary intent of the statute, the statute must be construed to authorize the court to apply any of the sentencing options which are appropriate under the circumstances to the convicted addict.” In our opinion the language employed by the sentencing court, at bar, was equivocal on the question of its awareness of the options open for the sentence of a defendant who is a narcotic addict, not receivable by the NACC.

"Judgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed, in accordance with the following memorandum: Upon his plea of guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years and was ordered to pay $1,510 in restitution to the Rochester Police Department. The $1,510 represented unrecovered drug ""buy” money ex pended by the police in effecting defendant’s arrest. For reasons that follow, we conclude that the order of restitution is not authorized by Penal Law § 60.27, and we vacate that part of defendant’s sentence.
Penal Law § 60.27 (1) provides that the sentencing court ""shall consider restitution to the victim of the crime and may require restitution as part of the sentence imposed”. It is the policy of the State ""to encourage restitution by a person convicted of a criminal offense to the victims of his or her criminal activities in appropriate cases and to the extent that the defendant is reasonably able to do so” (legislative findings, L 1983, ch 397, § 1).
The term ""victim” is not defined in Penal Law § 60.27 and the issue of whether a law enforcement agency is a victim qualified to receive restitution of drug ""buy” money has not been decided at the appellate level in this State. Other jurisdictions have considered the issue. A Nebraska statute expressly provides for the recoupment of ""buy” money from a defendant convicted of a drug offense (see, Neb Rev Stat § 28-427 [1985]). North Carolina expressly prohibits restitution to government agencies for normal operating costs (see, NC Gen Stat § 15A-1343 [d]). In jurisdictions where the term ""victim” has specifically been defined, courts have found that a police department is a victim for purposes of restitution (see, e.g., State v Pettit, 73 Ore App 510, 698 P2d 1049, review denied 299 Ore 522, 702 P2d 1112; Commonwealth v Mourar, 349 Pa Super 583, 504 A2d 197, vacated on other grounds 517 Pa 83, 534 A2d 1050). In Illinois, however, where, as here, the applicable statute contains no definition of the term ""victim”, it has been held that a drug enforcement agency is not a victim for purposes of restitution: ""While certainly we would be remiss were we to hold that unlawful delivery of a controlled substance is a victimless crime, we would be blinking reality were we not to acknowledge that many, if not most, offenders are brought to justice through the efforts of undercover agents making buys with public monies. We will not, however, strain the commonly accepted understanding of the word Victim’ so as to include the public drug enforcement agency, MEG, in the case before us. Where public monies are expended in the pursuit of solving crimes, the expenditure is part of the investigating agency’s normal operating costs. The governmental entity conducting an investigation is not therefore considered a Victim’ to the extent that public monies are so expended. Evans v. Garrison (4th Cir. 1981), 657 F.2d 64.” (People v Evans, 122 111 App 3d 733, 740, 461 NE2d 634, 639.)
Having found in this State no expression of legislative intent to the contrary, we adopt the compelling analysis of the Illinois appellate court and conclude that defendant was improperly sentenced to make restitution to the Rochester Police Department. That part of the sentence must be vacated. (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court, Marks, J.— criminal possession of controlled substance, third degree.) Present — Dillon, P.

"The defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony (see Penal Law § 110.05 [1]; § 220.43), with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of five years to life. However, a sentence of an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years to life constitutes an illegally low sentence for a class A-I felony (see Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). Apparently, the parties and the court were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence (see Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). Under these circumstances, with the consent of the People, the conviction of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree to effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see People v Carter, 196 AD2d 633, 634; People v Rozo, 196 AD2d 514, 515; People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; see also People v Labode, 280 AD2d 400).

Ordered that the judgment and the amended judgment are affirmed.
The defendant was sentenced under indictment No. 233/86 to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years in connection with his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The defendant was also sentenced under that indictment to one year in prison for the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, to run concurrently with the sentence of 5 to 10 years. These crimes also constituted violations of the conditions of a term of probation which had been imposed upon the defendant’s conviction of the crime of burglary in the third degree under indictment No. 298/82. Consequently, the defendant was resentenced under that indictment to a consecutive indeterminate term of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years. The sentences imposed by the court were clearly within statutory limits (see, Penal Law §§ 140.20, 220.39, 220.03, 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]; § 70.00 [2] [d]; [3] [b]; § 70.15 [1] [b]) and were not harsh or excessive.

"Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his brief, from a sentence of the County Court, Nassau County (Brown, J.), imposed January 26, 2005, on the grounds that the sentence is excessive and illegal.
Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.
On December 3, 2004, with the prosecutor’s consent, the defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony, in full satisfaction of a superior court information which charged him with four separate class B felony drug offenses. In the course of his allocution, the defendant admitted that, on May 7, 2003, he sold a quantity of cocaine to another person. Upon his admission, he was adjudged a second felony offender, and he was promised the minimum permissible sentence of an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The matter was then adjourned for sentencing.
On January 26, 2005, the defendant appeared for sentencing. He claimed that he was entitled to the benefit of the relevant provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738) which had become effective on January 13, 2005, and which reduced the minimum sentence permissible for a prior felony offender convicted of a class C drug felony to a determinate term of two years imprisonment (see Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [ii]). The County Court rejected the defendant’s contention and sentenced him as promised to an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The defendant now appeals, claiming that, inter aha, as he was promised the minimum sentence permissible, the sentence imposed was illegal. We affirm.
In People v Behlog (74 NY2d 237, 240 [1989]), the Court of Appeals determined that, when the Legislature passes an ameliorative amendment that reduces the punishment for a crime, the lesser penalty may be imposed in all cases decided after the effective date of the enactment, even though the crime may have been committed before that date. The Court explained that the rationale for the rule is that “by mitigating the punishment the Legislature is necessarily presumed—absent some evidence to the contrary—to have determined that the lesser penalty sufficiently serves the legitimate demands of the criminal law” (id., emphasis supplied). As part of the Drug Law Reform Act (hereinafter the Act), however, the Legislature specifically provided that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, the Act’s ameliorative provisions “shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof’ (see L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]). That language is sufficient to indicate a legislative intent that the ameliorative provisions of the Act were not to be applied to crimes, like the one to which the defendant here pleaded guilty, committed prior to the effective date of the Act (see People v Goode, 25 AD3d 723 [2006]; People v Nelson, 21 AD3d 861, 862 [2005]; cf. People v Festo, 96 AD2d 765, 766 [1983], affd 60 NY2d 809 [1983]).
To the extent that the defendant contends that his sentence was excessive, his challenge is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Dixon, 5 AD3d 693, 694 [2004]; People v Chapman, 2 AD3d 647 [2003]).

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County, rendered January 5, 1977, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. Judgment affirmed. No opinion. Cohalan, J. P., Hawkins and Suozzi, JJ., concur; Titone, J., dissents and votes to vacate the sentence and remand the case to Criminal Term for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: It is evident from a reading of the change of plea minutes that the sentence imposed on the defendant-appellant was not prompted by the exercise of sound discretion by the Criminal Term but, rather, was foisted upon that court by the prosecutor. When asked by the defendant why he could not receive a minimum sentence of three years in return for pleading guilty to a class A-III felony, the court answered: ""Because the District Attorney will not let you plead to an A-III felony to get three years.” Later, the court reiterated that it was completely up to the District Attorney to say, ""Okay, let him go down to the A-III, providing he does a minimum of four years.” Such statertients as to the power of the District Attorney’s office to fix the term of sentence are totally at variance with our judicial system. Sentencing is a judicial responsibility and any attempt to undermine judicial control in the sentencing process must be rejected, as must any attempt to undermine the prosecutor’s responsibility in recommending lesser pleas (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert den 419 US 1122). Accordingly, I dissent and vote to vacate the sentence and remand the case to the Criminal Term to allow defendant, if he wishes, to withdraw his plea and have the indictment reinstated. If the defendant at that time chooses to let the plea stand, then the Criminal Term should resentence defendant in accordance with what it believes to be proper within the statutory limits (see People v Ruggiero, 56 AD2d 569).",,345,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

At the time of the plea, defendant was incarcerated. Although County Court did not advise defendant at the time of the plea that an enhanced sentence would be imposed if defendant failed to appear for sentencing, when defendant thereafter was released on .a bond prior to sentencing, the court advised him that he would be sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment if he failed to appear for sentencing. When defendant failed to appear for sentencing, the court issued a bench warrant and defendant was picked up on the warrant approximately one week after the sentencing date. The court imposed an enhanced sentence of 6 to 12 years. Although defendant waived his right to appeal, we conclude that defendant did not knowingly waive his right to appeal with respect to the enhanced sentence because there was no discussion of that issue at the time of the plea (see, People v Gilchrist, 251 AD2d 1030, 1031, Iv denied 92 NY2d 925). The condition that defendant return for sentencing was not imposed as a condition of the plea, and thus the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to Oneida County Court for resentencing (see, People v Spina, 186 AD2d 9, 9-10; see also, People v Nunez, 248 AD2d 561; cf., People v Radek, 202 AD2d 847, 848, Iv denied 83 NY2d 914, 84 NY2d 939). “[I]f the court finds that it is unable to impose the sentence which was agreed upon when the defendant pleaded guilty, the defendant should be permitted to withdraw the plea” (People v Rodney E., 77 NY2d 672, 676; see, People v Spina, supra at 10). In light of our determination, we decline to consider the remaining contentions. (Appeal from Judgment of Oneida County Court, Dwyer, J. — Attempted Criminal Sale Controlled Substance, 3rd Degree.)

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (Santagata, J.), rendered February 22, 1994, as amended May 25, 1994, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment to run consecutively to a sentence the defendant was then serving.
Ordered that the judgment as amended is affirmed.
The defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of all eight counts against him, in exchange for a favorable sentence (two concurrent terms of 31/2 to 7 years imprisonment). At sentencing the court erroneously directed that the sentence run consecutively, rather than concurrently, to a sentence of 3 to 6 years already being served by the defendant for another crime (Penal Law § 70.25 [2-a]). At the proceeding to amend the sentence, while the defendant was given the opportunity to speak, he neither requested to withdraw his plea nor protested that the new lesser, consecutive sentence imposed for the present offenses of 3 to 6 years imprisonment, was excessive.
As a general rule, ""a guilty plea induced by an unfulfilled promise either must be vacated or the promise honored” (People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 241, cert denied 419 US 1122; see also, People v Torres, 45 NY2d 751, 753). However, this principle is not applicable where, as here, the defendant’s claim has not been preserved for appellate review and where the sentence actually imposed was not abusive or illegal (see, People v Ifill, 108 AD2d 202, 203; see also, People v Aitken, 148 AD2d 459, 459-460; People v Jones, 140 AD2d 372; People v Burton, 133 AD2d 276).

"Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Laura A. Ward, J.), rendered May 18, 2009, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony drug offender, to concurrent terms of two years for each of the three counts, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision for third-degree possession and drug sale, and two years of post-release supervision for fifth degree drug possession, unanimously affirmed.
We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence. However, defendant’s purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid. At the plea proceeding, defendant agreed to plead guilty to the three charges contained in the indictment in exchange for the promised sentence. After defendant acknowledged the various trial rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, the court stated: “You also give up your right to appeal. Had you gone to trial in this case and been convicted, you could have appealed the sentence as well as the conviction, by pleading guilty you give up that right too. Understood?” The defendant answered, “Yes.” No mention was made of the appeal waiver at sentencing, and there was no written waiver executed.
The purported appeal waiver was invalid because defendant “may have erroneously believed that the right to appeal is automatically extinguished upon entry of a guilty plea” (People v Moyett, 7 NY3d 892, 893 [2006] [invalid waiver of appeal where court advised defendant that “by pleading guilty you give up your right to appeal the conviction”]). In this circumstance, and in the absence of a written waiver, there is no indication in the record that defendant understood the distinction between the right to appeal and the trial rights that are automatically forfeited as a result of a guilty plea (id.).
We previously have pointed out the problem with “the recurrent fusing, during allocution, of the defendant’s right to appeal . . . with those rights waived by a guilty plea in cases where waiving the right to appeal is a condition of the plea bargain” (People v Williams, 59 AD3d 339, 340 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 861 [2009]). Although “[a] court need not engage in any particular litany” to find a valid appeal waiver (People v Burney, 306 AD2d 173, 173 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 641 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), the better practice is for the court to secure a written waiver, along with a colloquy to ensure the defendant’s understanding of its contents, dr, at a minimum, to specifically articulate that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the “panoply of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]). A separate allocution on the waiver of the right to appeal is critical because “[b]y waiving the right to appeal in connection with a negotiated plea and sentence, a defendant agrees to end the proceedings entirely at the time of sentencing and to accept as reasonable the sentence imposed” (id. at 255).

Resentence affirmed.
Defendant presents no evidence of any broken promises on the part of the District Attorney nor any prosecutorial misconduct during the plea negotiations sufficient to warrant vacatur of his resentence (see People v Eason, 40 NY2d 297; People v David, 102 AD2d 551; People v Loebl, 77 AD2d 949).

"Appeal by the defendant, by permission, from an order of the County Court, Suffolk County (Weber, J.), dated May 18, 2012, which denied, without a hearing, his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate a judgment of the same court rendered February 14, 1991, convicting him of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the order is affirmed.
Pursuant to a negotiated disposition, on December 20, 1990, the defendant, a native of the Dominican Republic and, at that time, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On February 14, 1991, he was sentenced as promised. In 2010, the defendant was convicted of another felony, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Shortly after his arrest for that felony, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit of the United States Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against the defendant on the ground that his 1991 conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was a deportable offense. In those proceedings, the defendant conceded removability based on the 1991 conviction, but sought discretionary relief from deportation. The United States Immigration Court denied the defendant’s application, and directed that the defendant be deported. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order.
Thereafter, the defendant moved to vacate his 1991 conviction on the ground that he was deprived of the right to effective assistance of counsel, alleging that his attorney failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea, as required by Padilla v Kentucky (559 US 356 [2010]). The County Court denied the defendant’s motion, without a hearing, holding that Padilla did not apply retroactively and, in any event, the defendant failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s alleged failure to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea. By decision and order dated September 11, 2012, a Justice of this Court granted the defendant leave to appeal from the County Court’s order.
In Chaidez v United States (568 US —, 133 S Ct 1103 [2013]), the United States Supreme Court held that the rule stated in Padilla does not apply retroactively to persons whose convictions became final before Padilla was decided. Although the defendant argues, pursuant to Danforth v Minnesota (552 US 264, 282 [2008]), that this Court should give broader retroactive effect to the Padilla rule than required under Teague v Lane (489 US 288 [1989]), we have declined to do so (see People v Soodoo, 109 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2013]; People v Andrews, 108 AD3d 727 [2013]).
Here, without the benefit of the Padilla rule, the alleged failure of the defendant’s attorney to advise him of the possibility that he might be deported as a result of his plea does not constitute deficient performance under the United States or New York Constitutions. At the time that the defendant entered his plea of guilty in 1990, defense counsel’s performance was governed by the rule that “the failure of counsel to warn [a] defendant of the possibility of deportation” did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Vargas, 112 AD3d 979 [2013]; People v Soodoo, 109 AD3d at 1015; cf. People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 196-197 [2013]).
In light of our determination, we need not reach the defendant’s remaining contention.

"—Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law §§ 110.00, 220.39 [1]) and sentencing him as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years.
There is no merit to defendant’s challenge to the validity of the waiver of the right to appeal. The plea colloquy establishes that defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived the right to appeal (see, People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280). That waiver encompasses defendant’s contentions that evidence should have been suppressed and that police gave perjurious testimony before the Grand Jury (see, People v Lococo, supra, at 827; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737).
Although defendant’s challenge to the legality of the sentence survives the waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10), there is no merit to the contention that the sentence was rendered illegal by the way in which the predicate felony issue was handled. During the CPL 400.21 procedure, defendant was properly advised of the consequences of either not contesting, or successfully challenging, the constitutionality of the predicate felony conviction. Thus, Supreme Court discharged its duty under the statute (see, CPL 400.21 [3], [7] [b]; see generally, People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850; People v Polanco, 232 AD2d 674, 675).

"Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his brief, from a sentence of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Collini, J.), imposed May 19, 2005, upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, the sentence being an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4x/2 to 9 years as a second felony offender.
Ordered that the sentence is reversed, on the law, the adjudication of the defendant as a second felony offender is vacated, and the matter is remitted to Supreme Court, Kings County, for resentencing of the defendant in accordance herewith before a different Justice.
Following the defendant’s plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, the People served and filed a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 alleging that the defendant had been subjected to a predicate felony conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The defendant did not deny the conviction but claimed that it had been unconstitutionally obtained because, when he pleaded guilty, he had been under the influence of drugs and had said so to the federal judge in open court during the transcribed plea proceeding. The defendant stated that he requested a copy of the minutes of the proceeding to support his claim. The court adjourned the matter for eight days for a hearing.
On the adjourned date, the defendant reported that he had not yet received the minutes. The court, however, revealed that its chambers had contacted the defendant’s attorney in the prior federal case and had received a letter from that attorney stating that, to the best of his recollection, the defendant had been incarcerated at the time of the federal plea of guilty and was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. Additionally, the court disclosed that its chambers had contacted the federal judge who had taken the defendant’s plea. According to the court, the federal judge said that, to his recollection, when the defendant pleaded guilty, he had not been under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or anything else. The court announced that it found that “the Federal Court Judge was credible and the Federal Defender was credible,” but that the defendant was “incredible.” Accordingly, based on what it termed “overwhelming evidence,” the court rejected the defendant’s claim, adjudicated him a second felony offender, and imposed sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that he was not properly adjudicated a second felony offender. We agree.
CPL 400.21 prescribes the procedure for determining whether a defendant is a second felony offender. Where a defendant controverts an allegation necessary to support a finding that he or she has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction, the court must hold a hearing at which the People bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt “by evidence admissible under the rules applicable to a trial of the issue of guilt” that the “defendant has been subjected to such a predicate felony conviction” (CPL 400.21 [7] [a]). Because the statute provides that “[a] previous conviction . . . which was obtained in violation of the rights of the defendant under the . . . constitution of the United States must not be counted in determining whether the defendant has been subjected to ... a predicate felony conviction” (CPL 400.21 [7] [b]), a defendant may oppose a second felony offender adjudication by asserting that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Where such an assertion is made, however, it is the defendant’s burden to allege and prove the facts underlying the claim with substantial evidence sufficient to overcome the presumptions of the validity and regularity of the prior conviction (see People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 15-16 [1983]; People v Pierre, 45 AD3d 1056 [2007]).
Here, the defendant proposed to carry his burden by presenting the transcribed minutes of his federal plea proceeding which, he claimed, would show that his conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained because his plea was accepted despite his on-the-record statement that he was under the influence of drugs. The court did not reject his claim on the ground that such a plea would nevertheless be constitutional or that the defendant had unreasonably delayed in producing the minutes. Instead, the court rejected the defendant’s claim based on the reported results of its own investigation and the information privately provided to it by a federal judge and a defense attorney. This was improper. Moreover, in addition to the fact that the defendant had no opportunity to confront the federal judge or his prior attorney, to the extent that their statements were considered by the court to prove the truth of the assertion that the defendant was not under the influence of drugs at the time of his federal plea, the statements were hearsay and not, as required by the applicable statute, “evidence admissible under the rules applicable to a trial of the issue of guilt” (CPL 400.21 [7] [a]).
Accordingly, the sentence must be reversed and the matter remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for a new predicate felony hearing and resentence before a different Justice.

"— Appeal by the defendant from an amended judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Giaccio, J.), rendered May 14, 1991, convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon her plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the amended judgment is affirmed.
As part of a negotiated plea bargain, the defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law §§ 220.21, 110.05 [1]) and received an illegally low sentence of three years to life imprisonment, which is the minimum permissible sentence for a class A-II felony (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [it]; [2] [a]). The record reveals that at the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would have permitted the imposition of the agreed-upon minimum permissible sentence of three years to life imprisonment.
After the sentence had been imposed, the court became aware of the error and recalled the defendant and her attorney before it. An amended plea to the class A-II felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree was offered and accepted and the defendant was resentenced to the bargained-for prison term of three years to life imprisonment. On appeal, the defendant argues, inter alia, that the court lacked the authority to conform the record to the parties’ stated intent that the defendant plead guilty to a class A-II felony. We disagree.
It is well settled that ""[a] court has the inherent power to correct its own error in accepting a plea or imposing sentence when the error is clear from the face of the record as it is here” (Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, 175 AD2d 163, 164; People v Wright, 56 NY2d 613; People v Minaya, 54 NY2d 360, cert denied 455 US 1024; see also, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445; Matter of Campbell v Pesce, 60 NY2d 165). Here, the court’s ameliorative action — to which defense counsel consented — was ministerial in nature and fully comported with the expectations of the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant at the time the plea was originally entered and sentence imposed (see, Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra; People v Wright, supra; see also, Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, supra). The cases on which the defendant relies are distinguishable (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, supra; Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra). In both Kisloff and Campbell the Trial Justice sought to vacate previously entered pleas to misdemeanors and then attempted to either reinstate the original felony indictment counts (Matter of Campbell v Pesce, supra), or proposed that the defendant enter a new plea to a more serious crime (Matter of Kisloff v Covington, supra; see, People v Calderon, 79 NY2d 61; see also, People v Moquin, 77 NY2d 449). Here, in contrast, the court’s unobjected-to remedial action resulted in an amended plea to a less serious crime and the imposition of the same, minimum permissible prison term to which the defendant had voluntarily and knowingly agreed as part of her plea agreement (cf., Matter of Laveroni v Rohl, supra). In light of the foregoing, the defendant is not entitled to the vacatur of the amended plea.
We have reviewed the defendant’s remaining contention and find it to be without merit. Mangano, P.

"Appeal by the defendant from a resentence of the County Court, Suffolk County (Efman, J.), imposed January 28, 2011, upon his conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and unlawful possession of marijuana, upon his plea of guilty, the resentence being a determinate term of imprisonment of two years followed by a term of two years of postrelease supervision on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree.
Ordered that the resentence is affirmed.
The defendant pleaded guilty, inter alia, to criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, in exchange for the County Court’s promise to sentence him, among other things, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of IV2 to 4V2 years on that count of the indictment. The County Court (Gazzillo, J.) advised the defendant, inter alia, that if he was rearrested, the court would not be bound by its promise and would impose any appropriate sentence up to 25 years of imprisonment, which was the maximum allowable sentence. After entering into his plea agreement, the defendant was arrested. The County Court sentenced the defendant, among other things, to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 21h to 7 years on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree.
Subsequently, the County Court was informed that it had illegally sentenced the defendant to an indeterminate term of imprisonment on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, which was a violent felony requiring a determinate sentence. The County Court (Efman, J.), over the defendant’s objection, resentenced the defendant to a determinate term of imprisonment of two years plus two years of post-release supervision on the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree.
Under the circumstances of this case, the County Court properly resentenced the defendant. A trial court has the inher ent power to correct an illegal sentence, over a defendant’s objection, where the corrected sentence falls within the range initially stated by the court (see People v DeValle, 94 NY2d 870, 871-872 [2000]; People v Williams, 87 NY2d 1014 [1996]). Here, after the County Court learned that the indeterminate sentence imposed on the defendant for the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree was illegal, it exercised its inherent power to correct the sentence by imposing a determinate term of imprisonment of two years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. This sentence was within the range initially stated by the County Court, as it was less than the 25 years of imprisonment that could have been imposed on the defendant, since he was arrested after his plea and the County Court was no longer bound by its promised sentence.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, under the circumstances of this case, his plea was not rendered unknowing or involuntary simply because the County Court did not advise him that the crime of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree was a violent felony (see generally People v Brinkhuis, 44 AD3d 677 [2007]; cf.

"Appeals by the defendant from (1) a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Braslow, J.), rendered April 27, 2004, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence, and (2) a resentence of the same court imposed November 9, 2005, sentencing him, as a prior felony offender, to concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 15 years upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and eight years upon his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Ordered that the appeal from so much of the judgment as sought review of the sentence is dismissed, as that portion of the judgment was superseded by the resentence; and it is further,
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed insofar as reviewed; and it is further,
Ordered that the resentence is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the determinate term of imprisonment imposed upon the conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree to 12 years; as so modified, the resentence is affirmed.
The defendant’s challenge to the legal sufficiency of his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree is unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Hines, 97 NY2d 56, 61 [2001]; People v Soto, 8 AD3d 683 [2004]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the trier of fact, which saw and heard the witnesses (see People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94 [1903]). Its determination should be accorded great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless clearly unsupported by the record (see People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]; People v Garafolo, 44 AD2d 86, 88 [1974]). Upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15 [5]).

"Appeal by the defen dant from a judgment of the County Court, Rockland County (Kelly, J.), rendered August 9, 2005, convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon her plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s claim that she should have received youthful offender treatment is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to object or to move to withdraw her plea on the issue of youthful offender treatment (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Small, 7 AD3d 819 [2004]; People v Fryer, 2 AD3d 874 [2003]; People v Moralez, 267 AD2d 334 [1999]; People v Corbin, 243 AD2d 575 [1997]).
In any event, although the defendant was eligible for youthful offender treatment, as she was 18 years old when she committed the offense, “eligibility alone does not mandate youthful offender treatment. The granting of such benefit lies wholly within the discretion of the court” (People v Polansky, 125 AD2d 342, 343 [1986]; see People v Williams, 78 AD2d 642 [1980]). In light of the fact that the defendant and her codefendant were found to be in possession of a significant amount of cocaine, as well as an assault rifle and ammunition that had been purchased by the defendant, and the otherwise favorable plea agreement, the sentencing court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying her request for youthful offender treatment.

Memorandum: County Court properly terminated defendant’s participation in the drug court program (see CPL 180.20 [3]) and. sentenced defendant to a term of incarceration of 3 to 6 years. The court imposed the term of incarceration based on the failure of defendant to report to the Day Reporting Center and his possession of cocaine when he was taken into custody the following day. The contention of defendant that the court failed to comply with the terms of the plea agreement by terminating his participation in the program and sentencing him before new charges were filed is not preserved for our review (see 470.05 [2]), and we decline to exercise our power to review that contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see 470.15 [6] [a]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered August 31, 2000, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.
Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant waived indictment, entered a plea of guilty to charges of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and waived her right to appeal. Defendant was promised a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison on the drug sale charge and a concurrent definite one-year term on the weapon charge. Claiming that she was innocent of the drug sale and was suffering from postpartum depression when she entered her guilty plea, defendant moved to withdraw the plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea survived her waiver of the right to appeal and was preserved by her motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Pace, 284 AD2d 806). A review of the plea allocution discloses that defendant, who was represented by counsel, was fully informed of the rights she was waiving, understood the nature and consequences of her plea, was acting of her own free will without any coercion, had no mental health problems, and admitted that she committed the drug sale and weapon possession crimes at the time and place alleged in the superior court information. Accordingly, the allocution was sufficient to demonstrate that her plea was the result of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent choice (see, e.g., People v Bolden, 289 AD2d 607; People v Dashnaw, 260 AD2d 658, lv denied 93 NY2d 968). Whether to permit defendant to withdraw the guilty plea was a matter within County Court’s sound discretion and, absent an abuse of that discretion, the court’s determination will not be disturbed (see, People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746). In view of the absence of any evidence in the record to substantiate defendant’s subsequent claims of innocence and postpartum depression, claims which are inconsistent with her sworn statements at the time of the plea, we see no abuse of discretion in the court’s denial of the motion (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; People v Hunter, 246 AD2d 913).
In light of our resolution of defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea, her final claim regarding the severity of the sentence is encompassed by her waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v McCann, 289 AD2d 703). In any event, we find neither an abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed nor any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification.

Appeals from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered December 3, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.
In March 2004, defendant was convicted of criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and sentenced to five years of probation. Defendant’s probation was revoked in April 2007, at which time he was resentenced to 365 days in jail. In the interim, defendant was charged in two separate indictments with criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and criminal pos session of stolen property in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of both indictments and in exchange for prison terms of 1½ years plus one year of postrelease supervision on the drug charge and 1½ to 3 years on the stolen property charge, with those sentences to run concurrently. Defendant also waived his right to appeal. Although County Court subsequently sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to the promised prison terms, it ordered that the negotiated sentences run consecutive to any undischarged sentence that defendant owed on the prior probation violation. Defendant now appeals, contending that the failure to advise him that the negotiated sentences would run consecutive to the undischarged sentence warrants vacatur of his plea.
We agree. Preliminarily, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Walker, 47 AD3d 965, 966 [2008]). Further, because defendant was not apprised prior to sentencing that his negotiated sentences would run consecutive to his undischarged sentence, his challenge to “the validity of his plea is not precluded due to his failure to raise this issue in a postallocution motion” (People v Tausinger, 55 AD3d 956, 957 [2008]; cf. People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]; People v Rivera, 51 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2008]).
Turning to the merits, “a knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea requires that a defendant be informed as to the full extent of the exposure he faces upon sentencing” (People v Tausinger, 55 AD3d at 957). The record reflects that no mention of the undischarged sentence was made at defendant’s plea allocution or at any point prior to sentencing. Because defendant was unaware of the full extent of his exposure, we reverse the conviction and vacate the plea (cf. People v Rivera, 51 AD3d at 1269-1270; People v Bobo, 41 AD3d 129, 129-130 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 873 [2007]; People v Smith, 279 AD2d 487 [2001]).

"Casey, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Rosen, J.), rendered October 31, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon pleading guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of several other charges pending against him, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of IV2 to 4V2 years. The threshold inquiry on this appeal is the validity of defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal. A review of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding such waiver (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11) indicates that defendant was not on any drugs or medication at the time of his plea, he discussed the case thoroughly with his attorney, and he was advised in considerable detail by County Court of the rights he would be giving up, including the waiver of his right to appeal. The record further indicates that defendant, who is familiar with the criminal justice system, acknowledged his understanding of the significance of these waivers. In these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to appeal (see, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911; People v Hanna, 236 AD2d 742, 744, lv denied 89 NY2d 1094; People v Thompson, 234 AD2d 709, lv denied 89 NY2d 1016).
Furthermore, as defendant failed to move to withdraw or vacate his guilty plea, his further challenge to the knowing, voluntary and intelligent nature of said plea is precluded (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665; People v Rojas, 238 AD2d 727, 729), and the limited circumstances that would allow such a challenge in the absence of a formal postallocution motion (see, People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726; People v Lopez, supra, at 666) are not present here. In addition, to the extent that defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is preserved for our review (see, People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982), we find no indication in the record that defense counsel’s conduct affected the plea bargaining process or that defendant pleaded guilty as a result of counsel’s poor performance (see, People v McElhiney, 237 AD2d 827, lv denied 90 NY2d 861).
We finally find no merit to defendant’s contention that he was denied due process by the 22-month delay in the perfection of his appeal (see, People v Telesco, 189 AD2d 902, lv denied 81 NY2d 977). Defendant’s remaining contentions either lack merit or are not properly before this Court for review.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Plumadore, J.), rendered November 21,1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree.
On October 11, 1983, defendant was arrested and charged with criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and growing marihuana without a license in violation of section 3382 of the Public Health Law. Defendant waived indictment and consented to prosecution by Superior Court information (CPL 195.10). On October 26, 1983, after plea bargaining, defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of marihuana in the second degree in satisfaction of all charges. At that time the District Attorney stated that “at the time of sentence the district attorney’s office would not ask for time but that we would ask that the court follow the recommendations of the Franklin County Probation Department”. At that proceeding, the trial court explained the ramifications of defendant’s plea and specifically advised him that the sentence could be up to seven years. The court further advised defendant that: “although the district attorney will not be asking that you receive time at the time of sentencing, that is not binding upon this court and that the court can sentence you to any of the sentences that I previously informed you of.” Defendant, on that occasion, conceded that no one had promised any specific sentence.
After receiving the probation department’s presentence report which recommended a jail sentence, the trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence of incarceration with a minimum of two years and a maximum of six years. At the sentencing, there was no objection by defendant nor was there a motion to withdraw his plea.
On appeal, defendant appears to contend that there was an agreement that in exchange for his plea of guilty to a reduced charge he would not receive a sentence requiring his incarceration. However, the record is manifestly clear that no such agreement took place. The trial court specifically advised defendant that it would discharge its responsibility to sentence defendant in accordance with any of its prerogatives in spite of the fact that the prosecution would not urge incarceration. It is equally clear that the prosecutor stated that, although he would not independently recommend incarceration, he would urge the trial court to follow the recommendation of the probation department. The probation department recommended incarceration and the prosecutor did not make any recommendation at the sentencting.
Well-established law is that a sentence for a criminal action is solely within the discretion of the court (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 308). Even though the People and defendant agree to a sentence, the agreement is not binding upon the court (People v Thompson, 91 AD2d 672, mod 60 NY2d 513). In this instance, there was no agreement. The trial court carefully, fairly and fully advised defendant of the consequences of his plea and properly accepted his plea (People v Burgos, 88 AD2d 727).
Defendant’s remaining contention is that the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. Defendant has a record of prior convictions including two felony convictions. He has two convictions relating to controlled substances. We find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by the trial court.

We reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of 1% to 3Vz years was harsh and excessive. As a second felony offender, a prison term was mandatory and the most lenient sentence which could have been imposed was lYz to 3 years (Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [e]; [4] [b]). At the time he entered his plea, it was specifically stated that no agreement on sentencing had been made and County Court informed defendant that he could receive a prison term of 2 to 4 years.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Harris, J.), rendered May 5, 1989 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of 2 to 4 years was harsh and excessive. The crime he pleaded guilty to was a class D felony while the crime he was originally indicted for was a class B felony. Furthermore, the sentence was the most lenient sentence defendant could have received (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [d]; [4]) and was in accordance with the plea bargain.

"Lynch, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered March 10, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of, among others, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (two counts).
In 2013, after defendant sold cocaine to a confidential informant on two separate occasions, he was charged in a six-count indictment with two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. In a separate indictment, defendant was charged with one count of failing to register as a sex offender as a class E felony based upon his previous conviction for failure to register as a sex offender (see Correction Law §§ 168-f, 168-t). Pursuant to a combined negotiated disposition, defendant pleaded guilty to all counts in both indictments. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, asserting, among other things, that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to an aggregate prison term of six years on the drug convictions, a concurrent sentence of one year on the sex offender registration conviction, and three years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals from that part of the judgment pertaining to the drug-related convictions and we affirm.
Initially, we reject defendant’s claim that his appeal waiver was invalid. An appeal waiver is effective as long as the record confirms that it was knowing, intelligent and voluntary (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). This standard is met if the record reveals that “defendant [had] a full appreciation of the consequences of such waiver” (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and that defendant understood “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Here, the record of the plea proceedings reflects that County Court clearly stated the terms of the plea agreement covering both indictments, explained both the trial and appeal rights that defendant was waiving and specifically confirmed that defendant’s right to appeal was “separate and distinct” from those rights he was waiving as part of the plea and sentence agreement and that it meant he would “be giving up [his] right to appeal both the pleas and the sentences to a higher court.” Defendant unequivocally acknowledged that he had conferred with his attorney, signed the written appeal waiver and indicated that he understood the consequences of his plea and waiver. In our view, the record amply demonstrates that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340-341 [2015]; People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264; People v Turner, 126 AD3d 1228, 1229 [2015]; People v Sibounhome, 125 AD3d 1059, 1059 [2015]).
Defendant also contends that his guilty plea was involuntary. Generally, such a claim survives an appeal waiver and may be considered where, as here, it is preserved by a motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]; People v Miner, 120 AD3d 1449, 1449 [2014]). On this appeal, although defendant concedes that his pro se motion did not include a request for the appointment of substitute counsel, he claims that County Court was obligated to consider appointing substitute counsel because the gravamen of his motion was that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel before he agreed to plead guilty.
We are unable to conclude that County Court abused its discretion in not sua sponte appointing counsel based on defendant’s contentions of ineffective assistance. “It is well settled that a defendant has a right to the effective assistance of counsel on his or her motion to withdraw a guilty plea” (People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 966 [2013] [citations omitted]). Generally, when assessing whether substitute counsel should be appointed, a court should determine whether good cause exists based on “the timing of the defendant’s request, its effect on the progress of the case and whether present counsel will likely provide the defendant with meaningful assistance” (People v Linares, 2 NY3d 507, 510 [2004]). Relevant here, “[w]hen certain actions or inaction on the part of defense counsel is challenged on the motion, it may ... be necessary for defense counsel . . . when asked to by the court ... to explain his [or her] performance with respect to the plea” (People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d at 967). If counsel takes a position that is adverse to his or her client, then a conflict of interest arises and the defendant must be assigned new counsel (see id.; People v McCray, 106 AD3d 1374, 1375 [2013]). Where, as here, defense counsel takes no position on a motion to vacate a plea, no conflict of interest arises (see People v Hutchinson, 57 AD3d 1013, 1015 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 817 [2009]). Thus, County Court was not obligated to assign substitute counsel before deciding the motion (see People v Sylvan, 108 AD3d 869, 871 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1091 [2014]; People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d 861, 862-863 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1076 [2013]).
As to the merits of the motion to vacate the plea, our review of the plea colloquy confirms that defendant understood the terms of the plea agreement and that his acceptance of such terms was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; People v Howard, 119 AD3d 1090, 1090-1091 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 961 [2014]). We further find that nothing in the record casts doubt upon counsel’s effectiveness, and counsel negotiated a favorable plea deal (see People v Jackson, 128 AD3d 1279, 1280 [2015]). Defendant’s remaining claims, including his claim that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, are precluded by the valid appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Jackson, 128 AD3d at 1280).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered July 7, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant initially rejected a plea offer, but subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment and another uncharged crime. As part of the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal.

The court ultimately sentenced defendant to six years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that his sentence is harsh and excessive. We are, however, precluded from addressing this claim given defendant’s valid waiver of appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Moron, 89 AD3d 1234 [2011]). Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered June 4, 2002, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a three-count indictment. As part of the plea, defendant executed a comprehensive written waiver of the right to appeal. In addition to enumerating specific rights, the waiver contained a catch-all provision stating that defendant waived “[a]ny other matters which [she] may . . . appeal as of right or otherwise.” Defendant was thereafter sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 2 to 6 years in prison. She now appeals.
Defendant initially contends that the waiver is void in its entirety because its catch-all language encompassed issues that are nonwaivable. We find this argument to be without merit. Where a waiver of the right to appeal encompasses issues that are nonwaivable, this Court has excluded such issues from the scope of the waiver but otherwise upheld its validity (see People v Umber, 2 AD3d 1051, 1052 [2003]; People v Cridelle, 283 AD2d 775, 775 [2001]). Defendant’s reliance on People v Muniz (91 NY2d 570 [1998]) is misplaced. Contrary to defendant’s argument, that case does not require that a waiver expressly preserve a defendant’s right to appeal all nonwaivable claims (see id. at 574). Inasmuch as the plea and waiver were entered into by defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently, the waiver is valid and enforceable.
Defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by her valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Shaw, 309 AD2d 1074 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 601 [2004]). In any event, were we to consider this claim, we would find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Sampson, 301 AD2d 677, 678 [2003]; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 815 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]).

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that the sentence of four years to life imprisonment that he received upon his guilty plea is harsh and excessive. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of an 11-count indictment against him. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court, which was much less than the harshest possible sentence.

"Peters, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered July 17, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In a four-count indictment returned against defendant and a codefendant, defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon sentence of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s contention that his plea was not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered due to mental incompetency survives his waiver of the right to appeal but is unpreserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Coons, 73 AD3d 1343, 1344 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 803 [2010]; People v Dantzler, 63 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 799 [2010]). Moreover, defendant did not make any statements during the allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation requirement (see People v McKenzie, 66 AD3d 1056, 1057 [2009]; People v Dixon, 62 AD3d 1214, 1214 [2009] , lv denied 13 NY3d 743 [2009]). In any event, the record does not reflect that defendant lacked the capacity to enter a voluntary, knowing and intelligent plea. Although defendant informed County Court that he had previously suffered a brain injury in a motor vehicle accident, the court confirmed that defendant understood the proceedings and was able to clearly communicate with counsel, and he affirmed that there was nothing mentally or physically compromising his ability to enter a knowing plea. Accordingly, we would also conclude that County Court did not abuse its discretion by accepting defendant’s plea without holding a CPL article 730 competency hearing (see People v Sorey, 55 AD3d 1063, 1064 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 930 [2009]).
Defendant’s claim that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by counsel’s failure to request a CPL article 730 competency hearing, although not precluded by his appeal waiver as it relates to the voluntariness of his plea, is similarly unpreserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2010]; People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 853 [2009]). Inasmuch as there is nothing in the record to indicate to counsel that defendant lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings, we would find defendant’s claim to be unavailing (see People v Lafoe, 75 AD3d 663, 664 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 953 [2010] ; People v Jenks, 69 AD3d 1120, 1122 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 841 [2010]). Finally, defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive is precluded by his appeal waiver (see People v Peterkin, 77 AD3d 1017, 1018 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered May 8, 1990, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that County Court’s sentence of imprisonment disregarded the recommendation in the presentence report of probation and it was, therefore, harsh and excessive. Initially, we note that a recommendation by a probation department with respect to sentencing is not binding on the court, especially where, as here, defendant was on probation when she committed the crime for which she now stands convicted (see, People v Arogundy, 112 AD2d 1003, 1004, lv denied 66 NY2d 761). Given her admission that the substantial amount of crack that she possessed was exclusively hers, defendant received an advantageous plea agreement, which included the prosecution’s agreement that her plea and sentence of 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment would satisfy any violation of probation charge. Finally, defendant’s sentence was well within the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [c]; [3] [b]) and she pleaded guilty knowing that she would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by the court. Under the circumstances, it cannot be concluded that County Court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of imprisonment (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305; People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered August 22, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a persistent felony offender to a term of 15 years to life in prison. Defendant argues that his sentence must be vacated because County Court failed to set forth the reasons for sentencing him as a persistent felony offender as required by Penal Law § 70.10 (2). Our review of the record, however, reveals that defendant admitted to the allegations contained in the persistent felony offender statement during the plea allocution and agreed to be sentenced as such as part of the plea bargain. For this reason, we find that defendant’s claim is without merit (cf., People v Williams, 152 AD2d 861).

"Peters, J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered December 11, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered April 4, 1997, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction and set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
In August 1995, defendant entered a guilty plea to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for the People’s recommendation of a sentence of 4V2 to 9 years’ incarceration. Shortly thereafter, the Judge before whom the plea was taken recused himself. Upon his appearance before a different Judge, defendant availed himself of County Court’s offer to withdraw the plea and restore the case to arraignment status despite the People’s statement that the same recommended sentence would not be promised if defendant decided to plead guilty at a later date. Approximately five weeks later, he again pleaded guilty to the aforementioned two crimes with no sentencing recommendation by the People other than to seek second felony offender treatment rather than persistent felony offender treatment.
At the sentencing hearing, defendant unsuccessfully sought to withdraw the second plea on the basis of a “secret agreement” between defense counsel, the District Attorney and County Court whereby he was to receive lifetime probation in exchange for information regarding the Columbia County Drug Task Force. After the District Attorney and defense counsel denied the existence of any such agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to two concurrent inde terminate terms of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years. Subsequently, defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion seeking to vacate his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied and these appeals ensued.
Defendant now argues that his posttrial motion was erroneously denied and his conviction should be reversed because counsel’s advice to withdraw the first plea deprived him of effective assistance. We disagree. There is no record evidence that defense counsel advised defendant to withdraw his first plea. As defendant had not received a sentencing commitment from County Court regarding the first plea, the sentencing court retained discretion to impose an appropriate sentence notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement (see, People v Jarvis, 233 AD2d 632, lv denied 89 NY2d 943). Therefore, any advice to withdraw such plea and/or failure to ask County Court to accept the joint sentencing recommendation cannot be said to have deprived defendant of meaningful representation (see, People v Hobot, 84 NY2d 1021; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).
Notably, during the plea allocution conducted before defendant entered his second plea, he affirmatively represented that he was satisfied with counsel. Before the entry of his second plea, counsel reminded defendant that he was prepared to “go ahead with the hearings and defend him”. Upon further colloquy with County Court, defendant again represented that he did not want to go to trial.
At no time during the taking of the second plea, despite County Court’s reminder of his sentencing exposure as a second felony offender and possibly as a persistent felony offender, did defendant indicate his expectation of a specific sentence in exchange therefor or even that he intended to cooperate with the District Attorney in the hope of a preference. Not until sentencing did defense counsel, who defendant now seeks to have branded as “ineffective”, advise County Court of defendant’s “conversations” with the District Attorney and his client’s “understanding” that he would receive lifetime probation in exchange for his cooperation. While admitting that there were discussions concerning cooperation, the District Attorney denied offering or recommending a sentence of lifetime probation. Defense counsel admitted that while the possibility of lifetime probation was raised in conversations between himself, the District Attorney and defendant, no promise was made. Hence, upon this record we find no support for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, supra; People v Aiken, 45 NY2d 394).
Finally, under the circumstances presented we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed. Defendant, whose criminal history dates back to 1967, was sentenced within the statutory parameters as a second felony offender (see, People v Van Nordstrand, 238 AD2d 634; People v Dove, 233 AD2d 751, lv denied 89 NY2d 1011).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Forman, J.), rendered May 1, 2014, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, class B felonies, after he was arrested for possessing approximately 50 bags of crack cocaine. Following the denial, after a hearing, of his application for participation in a judicial diversion program (hereinafter JDP) (see CPL 216.05), the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, specifically preserving his right to appeal the denial of his application to participate in a JDP. He was thereafter sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a determinate term of imprisonment of six years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision.
The defendant’s sole argument on appeal is that the County Court erred in denying his application to participate in a JDP. “Courts are afforded great deference in making judicial diversion determinations” (People v Williams, 105 AD3d 1428, 1428 [2013]; see People v Powell, 110 AD3d 1383, 1383 [2013]; People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]). The court considered the appropriate statutory factors in making its determination (see CPL 216.05 [3] [b]; see generally People v DeYoung, 95 AD3d 71 [2012]), and found that the defendant’s alleged history of alcohol and substance abuse was not a contributing factor to his criminal behavior and that he was a threat to public safety. Upon our review of the record, we find that the court providently exercised its discretion in denying the defendant’s application to participate in a JDP (see People v Powell, 110 AD3d at 1383; People v Williams, 105 AD3d at 1428).

In satisfaction of an 11-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree. As part of the plea agreement, he executed a waiver of his right to appeal. Prior to sentencing, he moved to withdraw his plea, arguing that his counsel failed to accurately advise him regarding the possible sentence he might face if convicted following a trial. County Court denied the motion and defendant was subsequently sentenced to consecutive prison terms of six years and IV2 years, respectively. He now appeals, and we affirm.
Defendant contends that County Court improperly enhanced his bargained-for sentence by ordering that the two terms of imprisonment run consecutively rather than concurrently. Although this argument is not precluded by defendant’s appeal waiver (see People v Nicholson, 50 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 834 [2008]), it is unpreserved for our review as the record before us indicates that he did not move to withdraw his plea based upon the potential for an enhanced sentence, nor did he object at sentencing or move thereafter to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790-791 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]).
Defendant further argues that his counsel was ineffective in that he failed to explore alternatives to prison or to adequately explain the plea agreement to defendant. To the extent that this argument survives defendant’s appeal waiver and is preserved by his motion to withdraw his plea, it is not supported by the record. Defendant’s claim that his sentence is excessive is foreclosed by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Small, 82 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 801 [2011]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered March 30, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, defendant entered a knowing and voluntary plea to a reduced count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. In accordance with the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 8 Vs years to life. Defendant appeals, claiming that he did not waive the right to appeal and that the sentence is harsh and excessive.
As the People candidly concede, the record does not demonstrate a valid waiver of the right to appeal by defendant. There is, however, no basis to disturb the sentence. Inasmuch as the sentence was in accordance with the plea bargain and, considering the severity of the crime, the leniency accorded to defendant in permitting him to plead to one count of a reduced charge and defendant’s criminal history, which includes a Federal drug trafficking felony conviction, we see no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed and no basis for this Court to exercise its authority to modify the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v Van Nordstrand, 238 AD2d 634, 635, lv denied 90 NY2d 1015; People v Benoit, 142 AD2d 794, 795, lv denied 72 NY2d 915).

"Harvey, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Traficanti, Jr., J.), rendered October 18, 1988 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In September 1987, defendant was indicted by a Grand Jury for the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (two counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and conspiracy in the fourth degree. Following plea-bargaining negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and conspiracy in the second degree. Defendant was then sentenced upon his plea to the recommended indeterminate prison terms of 3 to 9 years on the conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and 3 to 9 years on the conviction for conspiracy. The terms were to run concurrently.
Thereafter, it was discovered that the original sentence imposed for the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance was not made in accordance with law. Specifically, the imposed sentence was based upon the parties’ mistaken belief that a conviction for attempted sale resulted in the reduction of the charge from a class A-II to a class B felony. As a result, defendant was given the opportunity on two separate occasions to withdraw his previous plea or to replead to a lesser crime, but defendant refused to do so. Ultimately, upon defendant’s repeated refusal to withdraw his plea, Supreme Court vacated the original sentence of 3 to 9 years on defendant’s plea of guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and resentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of three years to life on that crime, again to run concurrently with the conspiracy conviction. Following the imposition of this sentence defendant then attempted to withdraw his plea and the court refused. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Under the circumstances of this case, it was within Supreme Court’s discretion to resentence defendant to a term of imprisonment greater than that for which he had originally plea bargained. It is undisputed that the original sentence of 3 to 9 years imposed by the court for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was illegal since, as a class A-II felony (see, Penal Law § 110.05 [2]; § 220.41), the maximum term mandated by law for that crime is life imprisonment (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]). As a result, the sentence could not stand by operation of law (see, People v Beach, 152 AD2d 772). While such a situation entitles the defendant to vacatur of the sentence and the opportunity to withdraw the guilty plea (see, supra; People v Shelton, 100 AD2d 775), defendant chose not to withdraw his plea despite several documented opportunities for him to do so. Defendant even declined the People’s offer to allow him to plead to a lesser count of the indictment which would support the originally agreed-upon sentence. Since only the sentence and not the underlying plea was illegal, the proper curative course, in the absence of defendant’s consent to do otherwise, was to resentence him in accordance with law (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445, 450). The sentence imposed by the court was the lowest legal sentence that could be given and, accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion or other grounds for reversal.
Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Casey, Weiss and Harvey, JJ., concur.
Supreme Court first mistakenly vacated defendant’s valid guilty plea sua sponte and then realized its error and let the plea stand (see, Matter of Kisloff v Covington, 73 NY2d 445, 450).",,640,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"McCarthy, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered January 8, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment pursuant to a plea agreement that included a waiver of the right to appeal. Consistent with the agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to six years in prison to be followed by 2V2 years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we reject defendant’s challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver, as the plea colloquy and the written waiver executed in open court demonstrate that he know ingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Crispell, 136 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2016]; People v Donah, 127 AD3d 1413, 1413 [2015]). Defendant’s valid waiver of the right to appeal precludes his claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Clark, 135 AD3d 1239, 1240 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]; People v Clapper, 133 AD3d 1037, 1038 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 995 [2016]).
Defendant’s claims that his guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are unpreserved for our review, as the record does not indicate that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Almeida, 127 AD3d 1499, 1500 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1006 [2015]; People v Vandemark, 117 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]). Regarding the plea, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable, inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated a material element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt (see People v Atkinson, 124 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 949 [2015]; People v Lewis, 118 AD3d 1125, 1125-1126 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1003 [2014]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered February 22, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 41/2 years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, due to County Court’s failure during allocution to distinguish the right to appeal from the rights forfeited by his guilty plea, is unpersuasive; defendant, through his counseled written waiver, acknowledged his right to appeal, that he had discussed the waiver of that right and its consequences with counsel, and that he was waiving the right voluntarily (see People v Ramirez, 42 AD3d 671, 671-672 [2007]; see also People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122, 1123 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 925 [2009]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d 686, 687 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 794 [2008]; People v Getter, 52 AD3d 1117, 1118 [2008]; People v Cross, 42 AD3d 586, 587 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 960 [2007]). Defendant also contends that his plea was not entered voluntarily. While this issue survives his waiver of the right to appeal, it is not preserved for our review insofar as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction (see People v Dixon, 62 AD3d 1214, 1214 [2009]; People v Nunez, 56 AD3d 897, 898 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 928 [2009]). Moreover, “the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during his plea allocution which negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast significant doubt on his guilt” (People v Wright, 40 AD3d 1314, 1314 [2007]; see People v Cintron, 62 AD3d 1157, 1158 [2009]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Nichols, J.), rendered January 6, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (three counts).
Defendant was charged in an indictment with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree after he sold cocaine to undercover police officers on three separate occasions. He pleaded guilty to all of the charges contained in the indictment in satisfaction thereof. County Court advised defendant of the possible sentences that could be imposed, including that such sentences could run consecutive to one another and that he could receive longer sentences due to his prior felony conviction, but made no promises with respect to sentencing. In imposing sentence, County Court determined that the last four counts of the indictment would run concurrent to one another but consecutive to the first two counts and sentenced defendant to a total of 10 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Despite defense counsel’s request, County Court declined to direct that defendant participate in the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (hereinafter CASAT) program during his incarceration. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive and that he should have been directed to participate in the CASAT program. Based upon our review of the record, we disagree. Defendant exhibited a pattern of drug-related activity as is evidenced by the offenses charged in the indictment as well as his criminal record. In addition, no promises were made by County Court with respect to sentencing and defendant actually received a much lesser sentence than he could have if convicted after trial. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v McDonald, 43 AD3d 1207 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 867 [2008]; People v Reynoso, 11 AD3d 719, 720 [2004]; People v Davis, 4 AD3d 567, 568 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 798 [2004]).

"Mikoll, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Friedlander, J.), rendered June 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Defendant contends on appeal that County Court erred in denying his request for adjudication as a youthful offender. Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, a class D violent felony, in satisfaction of a multicount indictment involving the possession of loaded firearms.
The youthful offender statute, CPL 720.20, excepts from the definition of ""eligible youth” a person convicted of an ""armed felony”, which includes possession of a deadly weapon (see, CPL 1.20 [41]). A deadly weapon is a loaded weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury, may be discharged (Penal Law § 265.02 [4]). Having pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, defendant was not an ""eligible youth”. Notwithstanding his plea to an armed felony, youthful offender status could be accorded if County Court found mitigating circumstances (see, CPL 720.10 [3]).
Defendant urges that it is unclear as to whether County Court denied youthful offender treatment due to defendant’s ineligibility or as a matter of sentencing discretion. This issue was not preserved for appellate review. Defendant failed to object to the court’s sentencing procedure and never moved for reconsideration or clarification of the youthful offender determination under CPL 220.60 (3) or 440.10. We therefore decline to consider the question.
In any event, denial of the youthful offender treatment was an appropriate exercise of County Court’s discretion. It was disclosed to the court by way of defendant’s statement that his possession of the .38 caliber handgun was to protect a drug enterprise in which he was actively involved. Also, in considering the circumstances attendant on the commission of the crime, Grand Jury minutes were presented to the court by the District Attorney as part of the sentencing procedure. We find defendant’s objection to their use for this purpose without merit. A sentencing court may consider any relevant information, subject only to the due process requirement that the information is ""reliable and accurate” (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 712). Considering the information supplied bearing on the manner in which the crime was committed and defendant’s past criminal activity, the court properly found that no mitigating circumstances exist warranting youthful offender treatment (see, People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325, 334, affd 67 NY2d 625).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigán, J.), rendered August 26, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the top count of an indictment alleging the sale of cocaine. The plea was in satisfaction of that indictment and another which charged defendant with a similar sale which occurred while the first charge was pending. The plea bargain provided for a prison sentence of 4 to 12 years, unless defendant, in cooperation with the State Police, facilitated an A-II felony cocaine sale by a drug dealer to an undercover State Police investigator. In such event, the sentence would be 3 to 9 years. The sale had to occur within 30 days of the plea and be to the satisfaction of the prosecutor. Defendant was released with warnings that if he failed to return for his scheduled sentencing, the bargain as to the sentence would be off. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing, was thereafter apprehended and sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison.
After defendant failed to appear for sentencing, defense counsel moved to have the Trial Judge recuse himself. Prior to defendant’s plea, the Judge had contacted the State Police in an effort to confirm the status of a continuing defense counsel representation that defendant was working with the State Police. The claim was being used as a basis to delay the proceedings. Defendant contended that the contact prejudiced the Judge against him and that County Court erred in denying the recusal motion.
Where no legal ground for disqualification exists (see, Judiciary Law § 14), it is up to the conscience and discretion of the Trial Judge to determine if recusal is warranted under a given set of circumstances (see, People v Moreno, 70 NY2d 403). We find no abuse of County Court’s discretion in refusing defendant’s motion for recusal (see, People v Brunner, 182 AD2d 1123, lv denied 80 NY2d 828; People v Webb, 159 AD2d 289, lv denied 76 NY2d 744). The complained-of conduct was unrelated to the issue of defendant’s guilt, occurred prior to the plea at which time the defense was fully aware of the contact and made no objection, and did not impact the sentence or the conditions to be completed to receive a reduced sentence. It must be noted that defendant did not move to withdraw his plea and does not seek such relief within this appeal.
We find no merit to defendant’s remaining contentions. De fendant had an opportunity to explain the circumstances of his failure to appear, as well as his efforts to cooperate and meet the terms of his plea bargain. He failed to do so (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702). Defense counsel’s conclusory explanation failed to raise an issue of fact requiring further inquiry. We find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances with defendant’s sentencing, and decline to disturb the sentence imposed.

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall, J.), rendered May 7, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a multicount indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. According to the plea agreement, defendant would be sentenced to five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision; however, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea in the event the sentence imposed in a pending criminal matter in Washington County did not run concurrently with the proposed sentence in the instant matter. Thereafter, based upon the consecutive nature of the sentence imposed in Washington County, the instant sentence was renegotiated and defendant was sentenced to a prison term of seven years—to run concurrently with the Washington County sentence—followed by two years of post-release supervision.
Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalidated by the renegotiation of the instant sentence. The record belies defendant’s contention that he withdrew his plea of guilty inasmuch as the sentencing minutes specify that defendant was “not looking to withdraw the plea.”
Although defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea is not precluded by the waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]), his contention that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lopez, 295 AD2d 701, 701 [2002]). To the extent that his claim of inef fective assistance of counsel survives the appeal waiver, it is similarly unpreserved (see People v Anderson, 63 AD3d 1191, 1193 [2009]).
Finally, the appeal waiver precludes defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed (see People v Platero, 63 AD3d 1446, 1446 [2009]; People v Tabbott, 61 AD3d 1183, 1184 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 750 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr, J.), rendered April 4, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 21fe to 5 years. He appeals, asserting that the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738), which was signed into law after he was arrested but before he was sentenced, should apply retroactively to his case pursuant to the amelioration doctrine enunciated in People v Behlog (74 NY2d 237 [1989]).
We disagree and affirm. The Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act was intended to apply only in instances where the criminal conduct was committed on or subsequent to the effective date thereof (see People v Ward, 27 AD3d 776, 778 [2006]; People v Clinton, 22 AD3d 887, 888 [2005]; see also People v Nelson, 21 AD.3d 861, 862 [2005], lv granted 6 NY3d 757 [2005]). In view of this disposition, defendant’s contention that he should have been advised that he was eligible to be sentenced to a determinate sentence pursuant to the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act is meritless.

Defendant argues that the prison sentence he received of 5 to 15 yeárs was harsh and excessive. Initially, in reviewing the record in this case, we find that defendant failed to preserve this argument for review when he agreed to waive his right to appeal. In any event we reject this argument. In so doing, we note that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a 12-count indictment, pleaded. guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed and was not given the harshest possible sentence.

Defendant pleaded guilty to nine separate crimes as a result of drug-related activities he engaged in on four different occasions. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each crime, the longest of which was 3 to 15 years. Defendant asserts that because he has a drug problem and this is his first felony conviction, the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. The record reveals that defendant continued to engage in drug-related activities even after his first arrest and, further, that defendant rejected an offer made by the prosecution of less substantial sentences. As a consequence, defendant pleaded guilty without having negotiated a specific sentence in connection with his plea. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), entered June 28, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
As the result of defendant’s alleged possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia at his residence on September 2, 1992 and $100 sales of cocaine to State Police informants on August 17, 1992 and on August 31, 1992, three separate indictments were obtained, charging defendant with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and two counts each of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree. Defendant disposed of all three indictments with a plea of guilty to a single count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 4 to 12 years and a $5,000 fine. Defendant now appeals, challenging only the sentence imposed by County Court.
Initially, we reject the contention that the prison sentence imposed by County Court was harsh and excessive (see, People v Simon, 180 AD2d 866, lv denied 80 NY2d 838), particularly in view of the fact that defendant was on probation for a prior drug offense at the time of commission of the current crime and that, by pleading guilty to a single class C felony, he avoided exposure to consecutive prison terms of 8 Vs to 25 years. We agree with defendant, however, that County Court erred in imposing the $5,000 fine without complying with the requirement of Penal Law § 80.00 (1) (c) that it ""consider the profit gained by defendant’s conduct, whether the amount of the fine is disproportionate to the conduct in which defendant engaged, its impact on any victims, and defendant’s economic circumstances”. We are not persuaded by the People’s argument that the statutory requirement is inapplicable because defendant was not convicted of a felony defined in Penal Law article 220 but, rather, one defined in Penal Law articles 220 and 110 (see, Penal Law § 80.00 [1] [c]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered September 2, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and the violation of driving while ability impaired, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered September 2, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In April 2009, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and driving while ability impaired. In connection with his plea, defendant was to be sentenced to five years of probation — provided he first complied with the terms of a one-year period of interim probation supervision. Failure to abide by the enumerated terms and conditions of such probation would expose defendant to a prison term of up to 2h years.
Less than one year later, defendant was charged in a 12-count indictment with various drug-related offenses and, in full satisfaction thereof, pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the underlying plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years and a period of postrelease supervision. Based upon that same conduct, defendant was found to have violated the terms of his interim probation and was sentenced to 2V2 years in prison followed by one year of postrelease supervision, said sentence to run consecutively to the sentences imposed upon the indicted charges. These appeals by defendant ensued.
We affirm. Although County Court attempted to impose consecutive periods of postrelease supervision, “the periods of post-release supervision imposed [up]on [defendant’s] consecutive terms of imprisonment ‘shall merge with and be satisfied by discharge of the period of post[ ]release supervision having the longest unexpired time to run’ ” (People v VanValkinburgh, 90 AD3d 1553, 1554 [2011], quoting Penal Law § 70.45 [5] [c]; see People v Nelson, 46 AD3d 932, 933 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 814 [2008]; People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 732 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]) — here, two years. Accordingly, we need not remit for clarification or other corrective action (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d at 732).
Defendant’s challenge to the validity of his respective waivers of the right to appeal is similarly unavailing, as the record reflects that County Court adequately explained the nature of the rights being forfeited and defendant executed detailed written waivers in open court (see People v Revette, 102 AD3d 1065, 1065 [2013]). Having validly waived his right to appeal his convictions and sentences, defendant is precluded from now arguing that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive (see People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012]).
Nor are we persuaded that defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea to the superior court information because restitution was not part of the underlying plea agreement (see generally People v Gantt, 63 AD3d 1379, 1379-1380 [2009]). Notwithstanding the limitations otherwise imposed by CPL 430.10, “[a] court has the inherent power to correct its mistake in sentencing a defendant where the mistake is clear from the record and the correction fully comports with the expectations of the parties at the time of sentencing” (People v Jackson, 59 AD3d 971, 972 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 854 [2009]; see People v Richardson, 100 NY2d 847, 850-851 [2003]). Here, it is apparent that County Court simply misspoke when it initially ordered restitution with respect to defendant’s conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and, upon realizing its error, the court verified that “there was no restitution [awarded] in this matter” and directed that an amended sentence and commitment order be issued omitting any reference thereto. County Court’s clarification in this regard was entirely permissible and, therefore, defendant’s argument on this point must fail. Defendant’s related challenge to the imposition of the statutory surcharge also is unpersuasive, as “we do not require that a defendant be advised, prior to his or her plea, that the statutory surcharge is a part of the sentence” (People v Fauntleroy, 57 AD3d 1167, 1168 [2008] [internal quota tion marks and citation omitted]). We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be lacking in merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chenango County (Dowd, J.), rendered October 19, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In a seven-count indictment, defendant was charged with various degrees of criminal possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy based on his alleged participation in a scheme to sell cocaine from a motel room in the Town of Norwich, Chenango County. In satisfaction of all charges, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the second count of the indictment, which charged criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon the understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea and, after a hearing, County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon term. Defendant appeals.
During the plea allocution, defendant declared that his plea was voluntary, acknowledged his understanding of the rights he was waiving and admitted that while acting in concert with two codefendants, he knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully possessed cocaine with intent to sell it. Defendant thereafter explained that he did not actually sell any drugs, but when County Court began to question defendant about his guilt of the criminal possession charge, defense counsel requested and received time to speak with his client, after which defendant reaffirmed the truth of his prior acknowledgments and admissions and reiterated his guilty plea. At the subsequent hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea, defendant stated that he did not want to accept the plea bargain because “I don’t feel I should get the same or more than the man who was really running the business”. We find no error in County Court’s acceptance of the plea and denial of the motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Murphy, 243 AD2d 954, lv denied 91 NY2d 835).
Considering the record as a whole, including the advantageous plea bargain whereby defendant avoided a possible sentence of SVs years to life in prison on the top count of the indictment, it is clear that defendant received meaningful representation (see, People v Loomis, 256 AD2d 808, lv denied 93 NY2d 854). And, as defense counsel effectively argued the motion to withdraw the plea (see, People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 941) County Court cannot be faulted for failing to appoint new counsel to pursue the motion (see, People v Davis, 246 AD2d 931, 932, lv denied 91 NY2d 1006). Lastly, given the advantageous plea bargain, whereby defendant was allowed to pleaded guilty to one count in satisfaction of a seven-count indictment and received less than the harshest sentence possible, there is no basis to disturb the sentence (see, People v Evans, 193 AD2d 960, 961).

"Peters, J.P.
In April 2008, defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In the course of plea negotiations, it came to light that defendant had a prior conviction for the federal crime of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, and he was informed that, as a result, he could be sentenced, as a violent predicate offender, to a prison term of 15 years on each count of the indictment if found guilty. Subsequently, defendant pleaded guilty, as a second violent felony offender, to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a negotiated sentence of four years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Thereafter, having failed to appear for sentencing as originally scheduled, defendant was sentenced to a prison term of six years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. In January 2010, defendant moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction or, in the alternative, to set aside the sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20. County Court denied defendant’s motion without a hearing. He now appeals by permission.
We agree with defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion without a hearing. Initially, we reject the People’s assertion that defendant is precluded from seeking to vacate his judgment of conviction through a CPL 440.10 motion as a result of his failure to raise such grounds on direct appeal. Defendant’s primary claim is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to counsel’s failure to realize and point out his true sentencing status. Because this claim is based on matters outside of the record, a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 is the appropriate procedural vehicle to raise this challenge (see People v Mobley, 59 AD3d 741, 742 [2009], Iv denied 12 NY3d 856 [2009]; People v Obert, 1 AD3d 631, 632 [2003], Iv denied 2 NY3d 764 [2004]; People v Reynolds, 309 AD2d 976, 976 [2003]; see generally People v Pendelton, 81 AD3d 1037, 1038-1039 [2011]).
Here, the People and defense counsel conducted plea negotiations and entered into a plea agreement, and County Court rendered a sentence, under the assumption that, based upon his 2000 federal conviction, defendant was a violent predicate felon. However, the elements of 18 USC § 922 (g) (8), the federal statute under which defendant was convicted, do not accord with any felony under New York law, and the People have failed to enumerate a state penal statute under which defendant could be considered a predicate felon (see Penal Law § 70.06 [1] [b] [i]; People v Yancy, 86 NY2d 239, 247 [1995]; People v Muniz, 74 NY2d 464, 467-468 [1989]; People v Mosby, 78 AD3d 1371, 1374 [2010], Iv denied 16 NY3d 834 [2011]; People v Perron, 273 AD2d 549, 550 [2000]). Therefore, we find a question as to whether counsel provided inadequate legal assistance by failing to detect and correct the mistaken impression of defendant’s sentencing status (see People v Thomson, 46 AD3d 939, 940 [2007], Iv denied 9 NY3d 1039 [2008]; People v Garcia, 19 AD3d 17, 20-21 [2005]). Moreover, were defendant not subject to be sentenced as a violent predicate felon, his current sentence of six years in prison is illegal (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [ii]). Under these circumstances, defendant raised an issue sufficient to require a hearing as to whether counsel’s representation was deficient and, if so, whether defendant was prejudiced thereby (see People v Mobley, 59 AD3d at 742; People v Garcia, 19 AD3d at 18; People v Reynolds, 309 AD2d at 977; People v Perron, 273 AD2d at 550; People v Miller, 144 AD2d 867, 868 [1988]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the Ulster County Court, rendered June 7, 1976, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class A-III felony. The record reveals that prior to trial the court conveyed to the defendant an offer of the District Attorney to recommend the minimum sentence for this felony of one year to life if he pleaded guilty. The court indicated that if the defendant offered to so plead guilty, the court would thereafter permit a withdrawal of the plea if it should find that a more severe sentence should be imposed. The defendant rejected the offer but now contends that the sentence of a minimum of four years to life is too severe. The record does not establish that the court imposed the sentence because the defendant went to trial, but instead that it was based upon the entire case as presided over by the Trial Judge and upon a presentence report. This appeal from the sentence raises no legal issues of merit and does not establish any basis for interference by this court. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered December 18, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years. We reject defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to suppress identification testimony. The record supports County Court’s determination that the photographic identification of defendant by an undercover police officer was confirmatory in nature and not unduly suggestive. In addition, the fact that the police officer was involved in two face-to-face drug transactions with defendant confirms County Court’s further finding that the officer had an independent basis for his identification testimony. Finally, we find no merit to defendant’s additional argument that the second felony offender statute is unconstitutional.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Teresi, J.), rendered March 19, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. He was sentenced accordingly and he now appeals.
Defendant asserts that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. While a valid waiver of the right to appeal precludes a defendant from raising such a claim (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1385 [2010]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1292 [2010]), we do not find that the waiver made by defendant here was valid. Notably, when the plea agreement was initially presented, the waiver was not referenced even though County Court specifically asked the parties if the recitation constituted the full agreement. In addition, although defendant gave an affirmative response when asked if he waived his right to appeal, the record does not indicate that he fully understood this right, that County Court comprehensively explained its nature as separate and distinct from the other rights defendant was waiving, or that defendant discussed the issue with counsel. Therefore, the waiver was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Middleton, 72 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2010]; see also People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]).
Nevertheless, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record, and he was apprehended while selling 28 envelopes of heroin to an undercover police officer. In view of this, and given that he was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]).

"McCarthy, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Catena, J.), rendered October 27, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, admitting that he sold heroin in exchange for cash. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, contrary to defendant’s contentions, his combined oral and written waiver of appeal was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 339-341 [2015]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; cf. People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 265 [2011]). The record reflects that defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea deal, was informed that he ordinarily retained the right to appeal his conviction and sentence “to a higher court” but that the People were requiring that he give up that right and, after conferring with counsel throughout the colloquy, defendant accepted this condition of the plea. The record belies his claim that County Court intimated that the waiver was an automatic consequence of his guilty plea, as the court completed its discussion of the trial-related rights automatically forfeited by the plea and then separately addressed the waiver of appeal, while specifying that it was a condition of the People’s offer, without lumping it with the trial rights (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; People v Forget, 136 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 929 [2016]). Defendant then executed a written waiver after reviewing it with counsel that made clear that the waiver of appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by his plea and reflected defendant’s understanding of the waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Given the valid appeal waiver, defendant is precluded from challenging the negotiated sentence as harsh and excessive (see id. at 255-256).
While defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his appeal waiver, it is unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see CPL 220.60 [2]; People v Williams, 27 NY3d 212, 214, 219-222 [2016]; People v Blair, 136 AD3d 1105, 1106 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1066 [2016]), and he did not make any statement during the plea allocution that triggered the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]). Defendant’s claim that County Court failed to adequately advise him of his constitutional, trial-related Boykin rights (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]) that he was forfeiting by his plea was not preserved despite an opportunity to do so; moreover, the record reflects that he was fully advised and understood the waiver of his trial rights (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 379, 381-384 [2015]). Further, it was not necessary, as he now contends, that he personally recite the elements of the crime, as his affirmative responses to the court’s questions were sufficient (see People v Griffith, 136 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2016]).
To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims implicate the voluntariness of his plea, they survive his appeal waiver, but they are also not properly before us because he never moved to withdraw his plea on this ground (see People v Islam, 134 AD3d 1348, 1349 [2015]). While defendant had unsuccessfully requested the assignment of a new attorney in an earlier proceeding at which he rejected an initial plea offer, he chose at the next appearance to proceed with the plea and did not thereafter move to withdraw his plea. Moreover, defendant failed to articulate good cause to replace assigned counsel, such as a conflict of interest or irreconcilable differences, and we discern no abuse of discretion in County Court’s denial of this request (see People v Smith, 18 NY3d 588, 592-593 [2012]; People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1264 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). In that regard, defendant’s generalized complaint that counsel had not spent sufficient time with him did not establish good cause for substitution or compel further inquiry under these circumstances (see People v Mitchell, 129 AD3d 1319, 1321 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1041 [2015]). Contrary to his argument, defense counsel did not take a position that was adverse to him or oppose substitution of counsel so as to give rise to a conflict of interest (see People v Mitchell, 21 NY3d 964, 967 [2013]; People v Tyler, 130 AD3d 1383, 1385 [2015]). Rather, when the court inquired, counsel properly recounted the steps he and his associate counsel had taken in representing defendant, which was in response to defendant’s request (see id.; see also People v Washington, 25 NY3d 1091, 1095 [2015]; People v Nelson, 7 NY3d 883, 884 [2006]). Thus, were we to address these issues, we would find that defendant received meaningful representation. Defendant’s remaining claims, including those properly raised in his pro se brief, have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.

. Defendant’s argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise statutory and constitutional speedy trial claims is unpreserved for our review as it was not raised in County Court. Moreover, his statutory speedy trial claim does not implicate the voluntariness of his plea and therefore does not survive his appeal waiver, and it was forfeited by his guilty plea (see People v Archie, 116 AD3d 1165, 1165 [2014]; People v Slingerland, 101 AD3d 1265, 1267 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]; People v Speranza, 96 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2012]).","Garry, Lynch, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur.",1043,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered April 8, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, executed a waiver of the right to appeal, and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of four years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s contention that he did not knowingly waive the right to appeal. Defendant was advised that the appeal waiver was part of the plea agreement and he executed a written waiver in open court after discussing the appeal waiver with counsel. Although County Court made a minimal inquiry, the record reveals that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal was a knowing and voluntary choice (see People v Binns, 82 AD3d 1449, 1450 [2011]; People v McCaskill, 76 AD3d 751, 752 [2010]). Accordingly, defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed; it is also unpreserved, as there is no indication on this record that he moved to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Taylor, 89 AD3d 1143, 1143 [2011]). The exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable, as defendant made no statements during the allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt (see People v McFarren, 83 AD3d 1209, 1209-1210 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 860 [2011]).
To the extent that defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relates to the voluntariness of the plea and, therefore, survives his appeal waiver, it is similarly unpreserved for our review given defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Tatum, 82 AD3d 1411, 1411 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]; People v Ivey, 79 AD3d 1531, 1532 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 859 [2011]). Finally, defendant’s contention that the sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice is barred by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Ivey, 79 AD3d at 1532; People v Fields, 41 AD3d 1089 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 961 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Lambert, J.), rendered October 9, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In June 2014, defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following his arraignment on that indictment, defendant was charged in another indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, and in full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and executed a written waiver of appeal in open court. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a second felony offender, a prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending that his appeal waiver is invalid and that his agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive.
Initially, we are unable to conclude that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made inasmuch as County Court failed to explain to defendant the import of the appeal waiver or that his waiver of the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty (see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d 1094, 1094-1095 [2015]). Further, “[t]he written waiver [of appeal] also failed to explain the separate and distinct nature of the right being waived” (People v Bouton, 107 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1072 [2013]). As County Court never adequately discussed the waiver of appeal with defendant, the appeal waiver is invalid and defendant is not precluded from challenging the severity of the sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; People v Bates, 146 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2017]; People v Larock, 139 AD3d 1241, 1242-1243 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]; People v Zabawczuk, 128 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 937 [2015]). In so concluding, we flatly reject the unsupportable position taken by the People that “[i]f [defendant’s] plea was voluntary and knowing, then his waiver of appeal as part of that plea was also.”
Turning to defendant’s challenge to his sentence as harsh and excessive, given defendant’s extensive criminal record and his agreement to the sentence as part of the negotiated plea agreement in satisfaction of two indictments, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Bates, 146 AD3d at 1076; People v Day, 133 AD3d 920, 920 [2015]; People v Rabideau, 130 AD3d at 1095).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County, rendered August 26, 1977, which adjudged appellant to be a youthful offender and sentenced her to a term of five years’ probation. After the denial of her motion to suppress certain evidence discovered by the police during a search of her bedroom, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony, on August 26, 1977. The court immediately vacated her conviction and, adjudging her to be a youthful offender, sentenced defendant to a term of five years probation. Seeking a dismissal of the indictment against her, defendant now appeals and argues that her motion to suppress should have been granted because the search of her bedroom was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We hold that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. The search of her bedroom to which defendant objects was undertaken by the police only after they obtained a written consent from defendant’s stepfather, Lester Platt. The basis of defendant’s appeal is that her stepfather lacked the requisite authority to consent to the search. We cannot agree. The bedroom search was precipitated when a high school girl who was sharing defendant’s bedroom for the duration of the school year was apprehended at school selling marihuana cigarettes. Since he was acting as a guardian of the girl in accordance with an agreement with her parents, Mr. Platt was immediately summoned to the school. He later agreed in writing to permit the police to conduct the search. While defendant emphasizes that six weeks previous to the search her stepfather had stopped living at the family residence as a result of a marital dispute, it is clear that he remained on friendly terms with his wife and family and his role as father was not significantly diminished. He continued to have free access to the home, visited there often, and the lease on the house with an accompanying option to buy remained in his name. Moreover, when he arrived with the police at the house, Mrs. Platt, his wife and defendant’s mother, conceded that she assumed a search was to be made and acquiesced therein. Under all of these circumstances, we hold that Mr. Platt clearly ""possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises * * * to be inspected” so as to legitimize his consent to the subject search (United States v Matlock, 415 US 164, 171), and, accordingly, defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied.

"—Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County, rendered April 3, 1979, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, on his plea of guilty, and imposing an indeterminate sentence of one year to life. By order dated August 20, 1979, this court remitted the matter to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court for further proceedings with respect to his disapproval of a sentence of lifetime probation and the appeal has been held in abeyance in the interim (People v Nudelman, 70 AD2d 13). The Administrative Judge has complied. Judgment modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence to a term of lifetime probation. As so modified, judgment affirmed and case remitted to the County Court, Nassau County, to fix the conditions of probation. On January 22, 1979 defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class A-III felony, in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fifth degrees. Pursuant to section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law, the sentencing court forwarded a letter dated February 15, 1979 to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court stating that in his opinion the ends of justice would best be served by imposing a sentence of lifetime probation on the defendant and requesting concurrence in the imposition of such a sentence. The request was denied by the Administrative Judge by crossing out the word ""approved” at the foot of the letter, leaving the word ""disapproved”. No reasons were stated. On April 3, 1979 the County Court imposed an indeterminate term of imprisonment of a minimum of one year and a maximum of life, the minimum sentence permissible in the absence of the concurrence of the Administrative Judge. This court held the appeal from the judgment of conviction in abeyance and remitted the matter to the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court for a statement of the basis for his determination and for the taking of proof if he deemed it necessary or advisable to do so (People v Nudelman, supra, opn per Mollen, P. J.). Pursuant to our remission the Administrative Judge has rendered an opinion, dated August 30, 1979, without a hearing, setting forth the basis for his denial of the application. As we held upon remitting this matter, the discretion exercised by an Administrative Judge in denying an application for concurrence in the imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation is reviewable. Pursuant to that power of review we find that such discretion was not properly exercised in this case and that the sentence should be reduced to lifetime probation. Section 65.00 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law provides that the court, with the concurrence of either the Administrative Judge of the court or the Administrative Judge of the judicial district, may impose a sentence of probation upon a person convicted of a class A-III felony if the prosecutor recommends such a sentence on the ground that the defendant has or is providing material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of any person for a felony defined in article 220 of the Penal Law. Four criteria are set forth to guide the court in the exercise of its discretion: (i) that institutional confinement of the defendant is not necessary for the protection of the public; (ii) that guidance, training or other assistance can be provided to the defendant through probation supervision; (iii) that the defendant has or is providing material assistance in the investigation, apprehension or prosecution of a person for a felony pursuant to article 220 of the Penal Law; and (iv) that such a sentence would not be inconsistent with the ends of justice. In this case the District Attorney of Nassau County recommended that the court impose a sentence of probation on the basis that the defendant had provided assistance in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of major felony violators as defined in article 220. That recommendation was supported by a letter from an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration Stating that as the result of the defendant’s co-operation two cases were initiated, one of which resulted in the purchase of one ounce of cocaine and another of which resulted in the purchase of approximately 1,000 noncontrolled pills and that both investigations were still active. The presentence report prepared by the Nassau County Probation Department indicated that the defendant was a student at Adelphi University at the time of his arrest and that he had no prior criminal record and recommended that he be considered for lifetime probation. The report did reveal that an A-III felony charge was pending against the defendant in Suffolk County. In our opinion, as implicitly found by the sentencing court, all the criteria set forth by the Legislature in enacting section 65.00 have been met in this case. The nature and circumstances of the crime indicate that institutional confinement is not necessary for the protection of the public. Clearly, the necessary guidance, training or other assistance can be effectively administered through probation supervision. The District Attorney, whose expertise places him in the best position to evaluate the matter, has stated that the defendant has provided assistance in the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of major violators of felonies as defined in article 220 of the Penal Law. Plainly, the imposition of probation here is not inconsistent with the ends of justice. This would seem to be a case in which no worthwhile purpose is to be served by incarceration of the defendant. In his written opinion the Administrative Judge of the County Court addressed himself only to the criterion relating to the providing of material assistance in connection with other criminal investigations and concluded, based upon a comparison of the criminal acts committed by the defendant and the investigations for which he had provided assistance, notwithstanding the statements of the District Attorney, that the defendant had not in fact provided the requisite material assistance. However, in so doing, the Administrative Judge indicated that his finding was influenced by a basic dissatisfaction with the statutory sentencing scheme by pointing out that many defendants convicted of class A-I or A-II drug felonies who themselves may have been unsophisticated youngsters who became involved in a single transaction would have willingly co-operated with law enforcement authorities in exchange for a sentence of probation if the statute had afforded them the opportunity to do so. He concluded as follows: ""In the light of this defendant’s involvement and failure to demonstrate substantial cooperation of the type contemplated by the statute, it would not appear to be in the interest of justice to accord him this special treatment not available to others less involved, and through no fault of their own incapable of cooperating to the extent required.” In sum we find that the refusal by the Administrative Judge of the Nassau County Court to concur in the imposition of a sentence of lifetime probation in this case constituted an improvident exercise of discretion.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered October 15, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. During the plea colloquy, as well as at sentencing, defendant indicated that he recalled being adjudicated a youthful offender on the conviction cited in the prior felony offender information filed against him. No information regarding youthful offender treatment was contained in the documentation obtained by the People. Although County Court informed defendant that he was entitled to a hearing on the matter (see CPL 400.21), defendant indicated his desire to proceed with sentencing and admitted the prior felony conviction. Defendant thereafter was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 3 to 6 years.
On appeal, defendant contends that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender when County Court failed to conduct a hearing pursuant to CPL 400.21. Initially, we note that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude his challenge to the legality of the sentence (see People v Dukes, 14 AD3d 732, 733 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 885 [2005]). Nevertheless, we find defendant’s contention to be without merit. The record clearly establishes that defendant knowingly waived his right to a predicate felony hearing and then admitted to the prior felony (see People v Jones, 185 AD2d 470, 472 [1992], lv denied 80 NY2d 975 [1992]; People v Williams, 106 AD2d 786, 787 [1984]).

Upon defendant’s plea of guilty to attempted burglary in the second degree and escape in the second degree, County Court (Schneer, J.) agreed to sentence her to the Willard substance abuse program. However, after reviewing the presentence investigation report, the court (Williams, J.) determined that the Willard program was not appropriate and indicated that it would instead sentence defendant to an aggregate term of four years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision. After defendant declined the court’s subsequent offers to allow her to withdraw her plea, the court sentenced her accordingly. Defendant now appeals.
Where a court determines that the negotiated sentence is not appropriate, it may impose an enhanced sentence if it first offers the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his or her plea (see People v Wilson, 69 AD3d 970, 971 [2010]; People v Haslow, 20 AD3d 680, 681 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 828 [2005]; see also People v Bonville, 69 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2010]). Here, defendant, who was fully informed at the sentencing proceeding of the sentence that County Court intended to impose, repeatedly declined the court’s offers to withdraw her plea and elected to proceed with sentencing. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the court’s imposition of an enhanced sentence (see People v Washburn, 76 AD3d 1120, 1120-1121 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 864 [2011]; People v Wilson, 69 AD3d at 971). Furthermore, given defendant’s criminal history and inability to comply with supervision, we are not persuaded that her substance abuse problems constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of her sentence (see People v Jones, 9 AD3d 686, 687 [2004]; People v Kane, 6 AD3d 986, 987 [2004]; People v Vansickle, 301 AD2d 963, 964 [2003]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered January 9, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was sentenced upon his plea of guilty to an agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 9 to 18 years. On appeal, defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his guilt, he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and his sentence was harsh and excessive.
The record reveals that defendant made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; see also, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273). In any event, by entering such a guilty plea defendant forfeited any argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the plea (see, People v Dunbar, 53 NY2d 868; People v Thomas, 53 NY2d 338; People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, 261, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026). Nor are we inclined to reverse in the interest of justice given defendant’s admission of guilt and express rejection during his plea colloquy of the agency defense now asserted on appeal. Further, were we to consider the issue we would find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court given defendant’s criminal record and the fact that he agreed to the sentence imposed, which was not the harshest possible, as a part of a negotiated plea that allowed him to plead guilty to one count in satisfaction of a four-count indictment (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Finally, we cannot conclude on the record before us that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and, to the extent that defendant’s claims rely upon material outside the record, they are not reviewable on this direct appeal (see, People v Pelaccio, 159 AD2d 734, lv denied 76 NY2d 793).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered October 4, 2005, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sede of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Arrested for selling cocaine, defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information, charging her with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a negotiated, signed plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge. In entering the plea agreement, defendant was advised that if she successfully completed both the inpatient and outpatient aspects of a specific drug treatment program, she could withdraw her plea, plead guilty to the misdemeanor of criminal possession of a controlled substance and be placed on three years of probation. She further agreed that if she failed to comply with the program or left prior to its completion, she would be in violation of the plea agreement and sentenced to a minimum term of 4x/2 to 9 years in prison.
Defendant completed the inpatient portion of the program but failed to complete the outpatient portion. After her arrest, she appeared before County Court, was provided with counsel and advised that the drug court team determined that she was no longer eligible to participate in the program. The matter was scheduled for sentencing and a presentence investigation was ordered. At sentencing, defendant’s conditional discharge was revoked and she was sentenced as a second felony offender to the minimum agreed upon term.
Upon appeal, defendant contends that she was denied due process when County Court failed to hold a formal evidentiary hearing prior to sentencing. While we agree that the sentencing court is required to conduct an inquiry sufficient to conclude that a violation of the plea agreement has occurred (see People v Valencia, 3 NY3d 714, 715 [2004]), defendant failed to contest County Court’s finding that she violated the plea agreement. For that reason, no formal hearing was required (see People v Hope, 32 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2006]; compare People v Jenkins, 29 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2006]).
As to defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of her plea, it is unpreserved since no objection was raised during sentencing and no motion was made to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Vance, 27 AD3d 1015, 1016 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]; People v Alexander, 21 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 881 [2005]). Since the plea colloquy does not cast significant doubt upon defendant’s guilt, we find no exception to the preservation rule (see People v Thomas, 307 AD2d 592, 592 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 625 [2003]).
Nor do we find merit to defendant’s contention that she did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. Viewing counsel’s performance in totality as of the time of the representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]), we note counsel’s success in negotiating a dismissal of the charge of resisting arrest and in obtaining the minimum sentence permitted by law. Defendant received meaningful representation since the plea is advantageous and no record evidence casts doubt upon the effectiveness of her counsel (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]).
Finding no merit to the claim that the sentence was harsh or excessive, we affirm.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered April 9, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, and with no promise regarding sentence, defendant entered a plea of guilty to two counts of that indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years. On this appeal, defendant contends that the indictment was insufficient and the sentence harsh and excessive.
Insofar as defendant’s argument regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of the indictment raises a jurisdictional claim, the indictment’s incorporation by reference to provisions of the Penal Law allegedly violated operates, without more, to sufficiently set forth all the elements of the crimes charged (see, People v Ray, 71 NY2d 849, 850; People v Cohen, 52 NY2d 584, 586). Thus, the indictment provided fair notice of the charges to defendant (see, People v Ray, supra, at 850). We further note that any claim regarding the factual sufficiency of the jurisdictionally sufficient accusatory instrument was waived by defendant’s guilty plea (see, People v Cohen, supra, at 587; People v George, 261 AD2d 711, 713, lv denied 93 NY2d 1018).
With regard to the sentence, which was well within the permissible statutory range, the record discloses neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor extraordinary circumstances warranting modification. Therefore, it will not be disturbed (see, People v Brown, 249 AD2d 835, 838; People v Tracey, 221 AD2d 738, lv denied 88 NY2d 943).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Siragusa, J.), rendered June 22, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree and resisting arrest as the result of a February 13, 1992 incident. Following unsuccessful motions to suppress physical evidence and statements defendant made to police officers following his arrest, the matter came on for trial. During jury selection, defendant entered into a plea bargain, under the terms of which he entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and waived his right to appeal, including his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motions, with the express understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of eight years to life. Subsequently, although expressly acquiescing in his plea and the negotiated sentence, defendant moved to vacate the waiver of appeal upon the ground that there had been numerous violations of his constitutional rights that he should be permitted to raise on appeal. County Court denied the motion. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant now appeals.
We affirm. It is now well-settled law that the People may, as a condition of a plea bargain, validly require a defendant to waive his right to appeal so long as the waiver is knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10-11). Our review of the plea minutes establishes that defendant clearly understood that he was waiving his right to appeal, including his right to challenge the denial of his suppression motions, as a condition of the negotiated plea and that he willingly accepted all of the terms of the plea bargain. That being the case, defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal will be enforced, precluding our consideration of his challenge to the denial of his suppression motions (see, People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536; People v Betancur, 203 AD2d 714, lv denied 83 NY2d 964; People v Antonio, 176 AD2d 528, lv denied 79 NY2d 824; People v Cornielle, 176 AD2d 190, lv denied 79 NY2d 855).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered December 19, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered January 6, 2015 in Sullivan County, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts). Following the denial of his motion to suppress statements made to police and physical evidence seized upon his arrest, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the charges and purportedly waived his right to appeal. In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to eight years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant’s subsequent CPL article 440 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction was denied without a hearing. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and, by permission, from the order denying his motion to vacate.
Initially, we find that defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal was not valid. During the plea colloquy, County Court failed to adequately convey “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]; People v Blackmon, 122 AD3d 1071, 1072 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1218 [2015]). Although defendant executed a detailed written waiver, there was no attempt by the court to “ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver” (People v Williams, 132 AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; accord People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d at 1423; People v Ritter, 124 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2015]).
Because the appeal waiver is invalid, defendant is not precluded from challenging County Court’s denial of his suppression motion. Nevertheless, we find no merit in his claim that the statements he made to police and the physical evidence seized upon his arrest should have been suppressed because the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest him. “Even if an arresting officer lacks personal knowledge sufficient to establish probable cause, the arrest will be lawful if the officer acts upon the direction of or as a result of communication with a superior or fellow officer or another police department provided that the police as a whole were in possession of information sufficient to constitute probable cause to make the arrest” (People v Taylor, 134 AD3d 1165, 1169 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted], lv denied 26 NY3d 1150 [2016]; accord People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d 99, 113 [1996]; see People v Carter, 140 AD3d 1394, 1395 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 969 [2016]). Here, probable cause was established by defendant’s sale of heroin to an undercover officer on the day before his arrest (see People v Stroman, 106 AD3d 1268, 1269-1270 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1046 [2013]; People v Perez, 47 AD3d 1071, 1072-1073 [2008]). The arresting officer testified that, although he had no personal knowledge of defendant’s activities at the time of the drug transaction, he was present at the scene. “While it would have been better practice to elicit direct evidence of a communication between the officers, the suppression court was not precluded from drawing the inference from the circumstantial evidence presented” that the information regarding the drug transaction had been conveyed to the arresting officer (People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d at 114; see People v Darby, 287 AD2d 300, 300 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 753 [2002]). Accordingly, the arrest of defendant was lawful, and County Court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress (see People v Ramirez-Portoreal, 88 NY2d at 114; People v Taylor, 134 AD3d at 1169-1170; People v Garcia, 131 AD3d 732, 734 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 997 [2016]).
We do, however, agree with defendant that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because County Court failed to advise him of the rights that he was waiving by pleading guilty (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013]; People v Proper, 133 AD3d 918, 919 [2015]). Although defendant’s challenge to the plea was not preserved through an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]; People v Sommers, 140 AD3d 1537, 1538 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 974 [2016]), we exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to reverse the judgment (see People v Mones, 130 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2015]; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d 1115, 1116-1117 [2015]). “While there is no mandatory catechism required of a pleading defendant, there must be an affirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his or her constitutional rights” (People v Lowe, 133 AD3d 1099, 1100 [2015] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]; see People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365-366; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1116-1117).
Here, County Court made no effort to explain the consequences of a guilty plea, making only a passing reference to them by asking defendant if anyone was forcing him to give up his “right[ ] to [a] jury trial” (see People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245-1246; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117; compare People v Proper, 133 AD3d at 919). The court further failed to establish that defendant had consulted with his counsel about the trial-related rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty or the constitutional consequences of a guilty plea, “instead making a vague inquiry into whether defendant had spoken to defense counsel” (People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117) or had any questions of his counsel regarding his “rights,” “the plea bargain, the trial and anything else that [was] important to [him]” (see People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Mones, 130 AD3d at 1245; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117). With no affirmative showing on the record that defendant understood and waived his constitutional rights when he entered the guilty plea, the plea was invalid and must be vacated (see People v Lowe, 133 AD3d at 1101; People v Klinger, 129 AD3d at 1117; People v Vences, 125 AD3d 1050, 1051 [2015]).
Finally, we reject defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his CPL article 440 motion without a hearing. Inasmuch as defendant’s claim that he was deprived of his right to testify before the grand jury can be determined on the record and was reviewable on direct appeal, County Court properly denied the motion without a hearing (see CPL 440.10 [2] [b]; People v Jones, 101 AD3d 1482, 1483 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]; People v Chiacchiarini, 91 AD3d 1118, 1119 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 863 [2012]; People v Lagas, 49 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 866 [2008]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered December 4, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, upon pleading guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4 (ó to 9 years. On this appeal, defendant claims that his guilty plea was invalid and that his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.
A review of the record of the plea allocution reveals that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Further, we find no support for defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, given that defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, which was the most lenient prison term possible, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered January 9, 2007, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, without a hearing.
In 2003, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and waived his right to appeal in return for an agreement that he receive a prison sentence of 3 to 6 years. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, a warrant was issued for his arrest and, after being apprehended, he was sentenced as a predicate felon to a prison term of 4 to 8 years. Wfiiile defendant’s direct appeal of this conviction was pending, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service served upon him a notice that, as a result of his conviction, deportation proceedings would be initiated against him. After defendant’s conviction was affirmed on appeal (25 AD3d 876 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 850 [2006]), he moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10 because, as defendant claimed, he only pleaded guilty in reliance on his counsel’s assurance that the resulting conviction would not mandate his deportation under federal law. Therefore, defendant claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and, as a result, his decision to enter a guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. County Court denied his application without a hearing. By permission of this Court, defendant now appeals.
Given defendant’s insistence that he would not have pleaded guilty but for counsel’s advice regarding the issue of deportation, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel impacts upon the voluntariness of his plea and survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 968 [2008]). The failure of counsel to correctly advise a defendant that a guilty plea may result in deportation under applicable federal law can provide a basis for vacating the guilty plea if it can be shown that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s misstatement; defendant would not have entered a guilty plea (see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 114-115 [2003]; People v Argueta, 46 AD3d 46, 50 [2007], lv dismissed 10 NY3d 761 [2008]; People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d 437, 440 [2004]). Here, defendant alleges that his counsel made an “assurance that he would not have to worry about Immigration trying to deport him” if he accepted the plea bargain and entered a guilty plea (compare People v Sepulveda, 65 AD3d 754, 755 [2009]; People v Nunez, 25 AD3d 376, 377 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 836 [2006]). In fact, federal law requires that all deportable aliens be removed from the United States and defines a deportable alien as one who has been convicted of “a violation of. . . any law or regulation of a [s]tate, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in [21 USC § 802]), other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana” (8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]; see People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d at 439). Given defendant’s insistence that he would not have pleaded guilty but for his reliance on this alleged misstatement by counsel of applicable federal law, County Court should have held a hearing prior to deciding defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion (compare People v McDonald, 1 NY3d at 115).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered May 19, 1993, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Upon defendant’s plea of guilty to the second count of the indictment which charged criminal sale of a controlled sub stance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 6 to 12 years. Although the record reveals that the plea was entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, and with the understanding that she would receive the sentence ultimately imposed, defendant nevertheless complains that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh. We find no merit in this claim, regardless of whether defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal was effective. Defendant is a second felony offender and as such could have received a sentence of 12 id to 25 years. In the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Clark, J.), rendered September 14, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In December 2005, defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Following the denial of his motion to suppress identification evidence, the matter proceeded to trial. On the day trial was scheduled to begin, defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of the crimes charged in the indictment, with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of lifetime probation if he cooperated with law enforcement officials, including the United States Attorney’s office and any other law enforcement agency deemed necessary; otherwise he would receive, at a minimum, a sentence of 372 years in prison. Notably, defendant executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.
After the United States Attorney’s office showed no interest in defendant’s cooperation, defendant conceded that he had agreed to cooperate with any law enforcement agency required, and indicated his willingness to cooperate with local authorities in order to satisfy the plea bargain. When defendant appeared for sentencing, however, the People indicated that he had failed to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Defendant then moved to withdraw his plea. County Court denied the motion and sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 372 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals, and we now affirm.
Initially, we reject defendant’s argument that his waiver of his right to appeal is invalid in light of the detailed, comprehensive written waiver that he executed when he entered his plea, as well as the colloquy in County Court further explaining the waiver at that time and defendant’s reaffirmation of the waiver following the denial of his motion to withdraw his plea (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d 686, 687 [2008]; People v VanDusen, 49 AD3d 1031, 1031-1032 [2008]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d 880, 880-881 [2008]). Although defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea survives his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d at 881), it is unpersuasive. A review of the record reveals that defendant confessed to the facts underlying the crimes and, as noted above, agreed to the condition that he cooperate with “law enforcement officials,” including the United States Attorney’s office and any other required law enforcement agency, in order to receive lifetime probation. Nevertheless, defendant failed to cooperate with authorities, despite the fact that his sentencing was postponed for approximately one year through multiple adjournments to allow him to meet the cooperation requirement. Under these circumstances, County Court properly denied defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea—which was based upon his unsubstantiated claims that he was innocent, had no information to provide authorities, and did not understand that cooperation with the authorities was a required condition of the plea—and imposed a term of imprisonment in light of defendant’s failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement (see People v Kirkland, 53 AD3d 673, 674 [2008]; People v Nicholson, 50 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2008]; People v Davis, 30 AD3d 893, 895 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 847 [2006]; People v Walker, 266 AD2d 727, 728 [1999], lv denied 96 NY2d 909 [2001]).
Defendant’s remaining challenges to the severity of his agreed-upon sentence, the denial of his suppression motion and County Court’s decision to resolve his motion to withdraw the plea without a hearing are precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Robles, 53 AD3d at 688; People v VanDusen, 49 AD3d at 1031-1032).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Vogt, J.), rendered May 21, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years because the court totally ignored the presentence report recommendation of probation. First, the recommendation in a presentence report is not binding on the sentencing court (see, People v Semkus, 122 AD2d 287, 288, lv denied 68 NY2d 1004). In addition, although County Court informed defendant at the time of his plea that it would not sentence him to anything harsher than 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment, it never made any promises to defendant with respect to any sentence of probation. In fact, the court specifically told defense counsel that defendant should not expect a prison sentence less than 1 to 3 years. Furthermore, even though the court could have sentenced defendant to a definite rather than an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, some term of imprisonment was still mandated (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [4]). As there is nothing in this record to support defendant’s contention that the court abused its discretion or to warrant the substitution of our own discretion for that of the sentencing court (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80), the judgment must be affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (McKeighan, J.), rendered May 2, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, received the agreed-upon sentence of five years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and executed a written waiver of his right to appeal. Defendant now appeals contending, among other things, that his waiver and resulting plea were involuntary.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, the record reflects that his waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. County Court’s explanation of the significance of the appeal waiver to defendant, along with defendant’s detailed written waiver executed in open court, adequately described the nature and scope of the rights waived. In addition, County Court confirmed that defendant had discussed the matter with counsel and ensured that such waiver had not been coerced (see People v Morrishaw, 56 AD3d 895, 896-897 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 761 [2009]; People v Jeske, 55 AD3d 1057, 1057-1058 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 898 [2008]). Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which to invalidate defendant’s valid waiver.
To the extent that defendant separately challenges the voluntariness of his plea, the issue survives his waiver of the right to appeal; his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate his judgment of conviction, however, renders this issue unpreserved for our review (see People v Nunez, 56 AD3d 897, 898 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 928 [2009]; People v Vallance, 49 AD3d 917, 917 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 845 [2008]). Further, “[t]he narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not triggered here inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during his allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea” (People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]).
We reach a similar conclusion regarding defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim—namely, that to the extent that it survives his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction renders this claim unpreserved for our review (see id. at 781; People v Crudup, 45 AD3d 1111, 1111 [2007]). Moreover, in view of defendant’s statements that he had sufficient time to confer with counsel and was satisfied with counsel’s representation, and based upon our review of the record as a whole, reversal in the interest of justice is unwarranted here.
Finally, defendant’s assertion that the negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Crudup, 45 AD3d at 1112).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Framer, J.), rendered January 24, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On March 9, 1988, a Grand Jury charged defendant in indictment No. 88-110-A with five crimes involving weapons, possession of controlled substances and use of drug paraphernalia. A second indictment (No. 88-110-B), returned on the same date, charged defendant with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance. Defendant pleaded guilty to single counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain in full satisfaction of both indictments, which included an agreed-upon sentence to two concurrent prison terms of 5 to 15 years as well as a waiver of defendant’s right to appeal the conviction on indictment No. 88-110-B. At sentencing, defendant’s new attorney requested leave to withdraw the guilty plea. County Court denied the request and this appeal ensued.
Defendant has raised three arguments. Initially, we find merit in defendant’s challenge to the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal regarding the second indictment. There is no indication that County Court specifically discussed the waiver of the right to appeal with defendant or that he understood the nature, terms and effect upon him. The record being devoid of this required colloquy, the waiver must be deemed invalid (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11).
Defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his application to withdraw his plea is not persuasive. Clearly, permission to withdraw a guilty plea rests solely within the trial court’s discretion (CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677; People v Gibson, 84 AD2d 885), and refusal to permit withdrawal does not constitute an abuse of that discretion unless there is some evidence or claim of innocence, fraud or mistake in inducing the plea (People v Randolph, 78 AD2d 566). Defendant has not made these required claims. Instead he has challenged the adequacy of the plea allocution, contending that the plea was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent, and that he was denied effective representation of counsel. We disagree and reject each contention. There was an extensive and thorough allocution in which defendant unreservedly acknowledged that he understood the charges and the significance of his plea; he stated that it was voluntary and without coercion or inducement, that he was satisfied with retained counsel who had replaced his initial attorneys and that he understood he would receive a compromise of the charges against him; he was also told the possible sentences facing him (see, People v Kennedy, 141 AD2d 975, 977, lv denied 72 NY2d 1046). His admission of both possession and the sale of cocaine provided a sufficient predicate for accepting the plea (see, People v La Boy, 152 AD2d 866; People v Quick, 146 AD2d 815, lv denied 73 NY2d 1020). Defendant’s factual recitation and responses to the questions from County Court established that he was fully aware of what was occurring and what he was doing (see, People v Bruno, 147 AD2d 490). There is nothing to indicate that the plea was improvident, involuntary or unknowingly made (see, People v Robideau, 133 AD2d 903, lv denied 71 NY2d 902).
Nor do we find merit in defendant’s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his agreement to plead guilty. While his initial attorneys may perhaps not have been as thorough as desired, they were succeeded by Alan Zwiebel, an attorney competent and experienced in criminal matters, who promptly initiated appropriate motion practice and investigation. Since the replacement attorney was fully aware of the alleged derelictions of his predecessors and nonetheless counseled acceptance of the plea bargain, defendant forfeited his claim or prior ineffective assistance of counsel as well as his appeal from the denial of permission to file a late suppression motion (see, People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529). We reject defendant’s belated claim made upon this appeal that Zwiebel was ineffective. The record shows that within the brief time available to him before the trial date, he moved for discovery, an operability report, a Sandoval hearing and for disclosure of Rosario material. He negotiated a plea bargain in which charges against defendant were compromised and a lesser sentence imposed.
We similarly turn away defendant’s contention that the search warrant was improperly issued upon a defective sup porting deposition and thus tainted the incriminating evidence obtained against him. The affidavit setting forth personal observations was made against the witnesses’ penal interest and contained a warning against a false statement (see, Penal Law §210.45); it supported issuance of the search warrant without extrinsic evidence of the informant’s reliability (see, People v Hicks, 38 NY2d 90; People v Santarelli, 148 AD2d 775). There is no basis to believe that a timely suppression motion would have been successful.
In sum, we find that defendant received meaningful representation from Zwiebel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137) and that his application to withdraw the plea was properly denied (see, People v Kelsch, 96 AD2d 677, supra).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered July 23, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and waived his right to appeal, with the understanding that the People would recommend a sentence of 2V2 to 5 years. Furthermore, the People agreed to have the sentence served in a substance abuse treatment program, on the condition that they were satisfied, based upon the presentence investigation report, that such treatment was warranted. County Court cautioned defendant that, even if the People consented, the program may not be available because he was subject to a parole hold. Ultimately, the People did not consent to the treatment program and defendant was sentenced as a second nonviolent felony offender to 2V2 to 5 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Although these claims, including the effective assistance of counsel argument to the extent that it impacts upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, are not precluded by defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal, they are unpreserved for our review due to defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Allen, 15 AD3d 689, 690 [2005]; People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004]). Were we to consider defendant’s arguments, we would find them to be without merit. The record reveals that defendant was fully informed about and understood the terms of the plea agreement. County Court thoroughly advised defendant of the rights he was relinquishing and he acknowledged that he understood those rights. Defendant also confirmed that he was acting voluntarily and that he had enough time to consider the plea and to consult with counsel. Additionally, there is nothing in the record which casts doubt upon the apparent effectiveness of counsel (see id.). We are satisfied that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent and that he was afforded meaningful representation (see People v Stone, 9 AD3d 498, 499 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 712 [2004]; People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742-743 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Cawley Jr., J.), rendered May 10, 2013, convicting de fendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal and was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to 2V2 years in prison, to be followed by one year of postrelease supervision. At defendant’s request, County Court adjourned the date of sentencing to allow defendant time to attend his son’s birthday party. The court, however, admonished defendant that he was required to appear in court at 9:30 a.m. on March 5, 2013 for sentencing and that, if he did not, the court could impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant failed to appear in court on the sentencing date at 9:30 a.m., but showed up at approximately 1:00 p.m. County Court postponed sentencing to consider whether the sentence should be enhanced, and the matter was adjourned further as a result of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea. County Court denied the motion and ultimately sentenced defendant to three years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant asserts that County Court abused its discretion in imposing the enhanced sentence. We disagree. County Court went out of its way to accommodate defendant’s request to have sentencing adjourned so that he could attend his son’s birthday party and even gave defendant an extra day so that he would not have to return on the date of the party. The court specifically warned him of the consequences of failing to appear, including the potentially longer sentence he faced, and indicated that bad weather or other such issues were not legitimate excuses. Nevertheless, defendant failed to appear at the required time and, when he finally came to court, claimed to have had transportation problems. Under the circumstances presented here, we cannot conclude that County Court abused its discretion in imposing an enhanced sentence (see People v Goodman, 79 AD3d 1285, 1286 [2010]; People v Baez, 67 AD3d 1204 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 797 [2010]).

"Lahtinen, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered December 1, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a con trolled substance in the third degree (a class C felony) in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with three class B felonies for allegedly possessing and selling cocaine. As part of the negotiated plea bargain, he executed a written waiver of his right to appeal and he received a sentence, as a second felony offender, of 5 to 10 years in prison. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s argument that his waiver of appeal was the product of coercion was not properly preserved for review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Kirkland, 2 AD3d 1063, 1063 [2003]; People v Holland, 270 AD2d 718, 718 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 798 [2000]). Even if we were to consider the argument, we would find it unpersuasive since the record reveals that defendant executed a detailed written waiver acknowledging his right to appeal, relating that he had discussed his appellate options with his attorney and stating that he was waiving his right to appeal voluntarily (see People v Ramos, 7 NY3d 737, 738 [2006]; People v Bronson, 28 AD3d 936, 937 [2006]). While defendant expressed disappointment with his attorney, there was no showing of ineffectiveness (see generally People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 113-114 [2003]) and no factual basis upon which to conclude that he was coerced to take the plea because of less than adequate representation by counsel. Indeed, counsel was able to negotiate a favorable deal in a case where defendant faced a potential life sentence if convicted.
We decline to address the remaining contentions in light of the effective appeal waiver.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Washington County (Berke, J.), rendered July 1, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree following his sale of heroin to a confidential police informant in 2003. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison. His subsequent CPL article 440 motion was denied and he was denied permission to appeal from that order. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction.
Initially, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant has an extensive criminal background, which includes two prior drug-related convictions, and the negotiated sentence he received was significantly less than the sentence that could have been imposed if he were convicted after trial. Therefore, we do not find the existence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cartwright, 301 AD2d 682 [2003]; People v Daniels, 281 AD2d 651 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 900 [2001]). In addition, because defendant committed the crime well before the effective date of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (see L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]), we reject his contention that he should have been sentenced under the new law (see People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676 [2006]). Finally, defendant’s equal protection challenge has been considered and found to be unavailing.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Tomlinson, J.), rendered May 26, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea bargain that included a waiver of his right to appeal, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of two indictments against him, with the understanding that he would receive a sentence of 2V2 to 7V2 years in prison. Thereafter, a presentence investigation was conducted and the Probation Department recommended that defendant be adjudicated a youthful offender. At sentencing, defense counsel requested that, notwithstanding the plea agreement, County Court and the prosecutor consent to youthful offender treatment. The request was refused, the aforementioned sentence was imposed and this appeal ensued.
Initially, we note “the general rule that a defendant’s challenge to the denial of a request for youthful offender treatment does not survive a valid waiver of the right to appeal” (People v Harrington, 281 AD2d 748; see, People v Congdon, 269 AD2d 615). We are unpersuaded by defendant’s argument that the sentence was illegally imposed and that his challenge survives the waiver. Specifically, he contends that County Court failed to exercise its discretion by rejecting defendant’s plea for leniency based solely on the plea agreement. Our review of the sentencing minutes satisfies us that the court did not reject defendant’s request for youthful offender treatment based solely on the plea agreement. Instead, the court determined that, under the circumstances, the sentence which had been negotiated by the parties was an appropriate disposition. As such, defendant’s challenge to the denial of youthful offender treatment does not survive the waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Wagoner, 234 AD2d 831). Defendant’s alternative argument, that his waiver of appeal should be vacated inasmuch as it was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered, is both unpreserved for review and lacking in merit (see, People v Dopp, 261 AD2d 715, 716). Accordingly, we perceive no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with six counts related to the sale and possession of cocaine. Defendant was then sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 12 years.
Defendant contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive and constitutes an abuse of discretion on the part of County Court. We disagree. The sentence was within the statutory guidelines and was in accordance with the plea bargain, pursuant to which five other charges against defendant were dropped. While the presentence report expresses some optimism regarding defendant’s potential for rehabilitation, he has nonetheless been found guilty of a serious crime. Hence, the sentence imposed by County Court cannot be characterized as an abuse of discretion and we decline to disturb it (see, People v Willis, 200 AD2d 903, 904).

"—Yesawich Jr., J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered May 26, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered January 15, 1999, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 and 440.20 to vacate the judgment of conviction and set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
Defendant was charged in a six-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and seventh degrees, all arising out of his alleged involvement in a drug transaction. Defendant’s counsel, the Public Defend er’s office, negotiated a plea agreement whereby defendant, in satisfaction of the entire indictment, would plead guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waive his right to appeal; in exchange, defendant would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 3V2 to 7 years in prison. Prior to sentencing, and after expressing dissatisfaction with his representation, defendant was assigned new counsel and afforded an adjournment to submit a motion, subsequently denied, to withdraw his guilty plea.
At sentencing, County Count departed from the original plea agreement and imposed instead an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years, doing so because defendant had breached the agreement by challenging the validity of his prior conviction which served as the basis for his status as a second felony offender. Defendant appeals from both the judgment of conviction and the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment made pursuant to CPL 440.10 and 440.20.
We reject defendant’s claim that the representation furnished him by both the Public Defender and subsequently assigned counsel was less than effective. The record reveals that defense counsel participated in disclosure, negotiated a favorable plea bargain, communicated with defendant about his case and, further — at defendant’s urging — moved to withdraw his plea and also made a postsentencing motion to vacate the plea. In short, the record is replete with evidence evincing that defendant received meaningful legal representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147).
That County Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s application to withdraw his guilty plea is borne out by the fact that, before entering the plea, defendant was fully informed of his rights, assured County Court that his plea was not the product of coercion and that he was not under the influence of alcohol or medication, and unequivocally admitted committing the acts comprising the crime. As County Court’s inquiry of defendant was sufficiently searching to ensure that defendant was aware of his rights and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived them, the court cannot be faulted for denying defendant’s request (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710; 711; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 798, lv denied 93 NY2d 980). And as the record amply supports County Court’s conclusion that defendant breached the plea agreement by spuriously claiming that his prior felony conviction was constitutionally infirm, the court was not obliged to abide by the terms of the original plea agreement.

Defendant’s contention that the sentence he received was harsh and excessive is without merit. His plea was entered into in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment. At the time of the plea the People recommended the harshest possible sentence of 816 to life (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]) and County Court specifically informed defendant that he could receive that sentence. In fact, however, at sentencing the People recommended the more lenient sentence of 6 years to life which in fact was the prison sentence imposed by the court. Under these circumstances, and in light of the severity of the crime, a class A-II felony, we find no abuse of discretion by the court in imposing sentence (see, People v Henao, 149 AD2d 531; People v Di Orio, 99 AD2d 593).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered November 16, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree as charged in a superior court information, and waived his right to appeal. The plea agreement, which also satisfied another pending charge, provided that defendant would receive a prison term of three years with two years of postrelease supervision subject to certain conditions, including that he “comply with the jail rules.” County Court specifically warned defendant that breaking the jail rules could result in an enhanced sentence of four years in prison. When defendant appeared for sentencing, the court advised the parties that it had received documents from the jail regarding defendant’s violation of jail rules, including possession of contraband and testing positive for opiates, which defendant did not dispute. The court determined that defendant had violated the conditions of his plea agreement and that it was no longer bound to the promised sentence, and imposed a prison term of four years with two years of postrelease supervision, as an admitted second drug felony offender. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid combined oral and written appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Hall, 147 AD3d 1151, 1151-1152 [2017]). Defendant was advised that an appeal waiver was a condition of the plea agreement, and County Court provided a detailed explanation of the rights that were not waived, ascertained that defendant understood the waiver and conveyed that it was separate and distinct from the trial-related rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea. Defendant then executed a written waiver of appeal, indicating that he had read and understood it and had no questions (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Khan, 139 AD3d 1261, 1262 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 932 [2016]). As defendant’s “full appreciation of the consequences and understanding of the terms and conditions of the plea, including a waiver of the right to appeal, are apparent on the face of the record” (People v Sanders, 25 NY3d 337, 340 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), we find that his waiver of appeal was made “knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Further, the court informed defendant of the specific conditions that he had to abide by or risk enhancement of his sentence, and defendant and counsel were afforded an opportunity to contest the violations and did not dispute that defendant had received adequate warnings and had violated the conditions. Accordingly, an enhanced sentence was authorized and did not constitute an abuse of discretion (see People v Albergotti, 17 NY3d 748, 750 [2011]; People v Lester, 141 AD3d 951, 953-954 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1185 [2017]). Given that the court advised him of the consequences of violating the conditions of his plea, defendant’s challenge to the enhanced sentence as harsh and excessive is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Gilbert, 145 AD3d 1196, 1197 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1184 [2017]; People v Lester, 141 AD3d at 954).

"Carpinello, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered January 22, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. These charges arose out of his sale of cocaine to a confidential police informant on two occasions in June 2000 and the discovery of cocaine during the execution of a valid search warrant. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 6V2 to 13 years. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we note that defendant signed a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal which forecloses his challenges to the denial of his suppression motion and the severity of his sentence (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Wilkins, 294 AD2d 707). Nevertheless, were we to reach these issues we would find them to be without merit. Testimony at the Wade hearing established that the photo array was conducted according to proper police procedure and was not unduly suggestive (see, People v Parker, 257 AD2d 693, 694, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024). In light of defendant’s extensive criminal history, our review of the record discloses no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed, nor any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant a modification (see, People v Vazquez, 284 AD2d 730, 730).
Furthermore, defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea and the competency of counsel, while not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, are not preserved for our review because he failed to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see, People v Doty, 267 AD2d 616, 617; People v Millis, 266 AD2d 581, 581, lv denied 94 NY2d 826). In any event, the record establishes that County Court engaged in a thorough plea colloquy with defendant, during which he acknowledged that he understood the rights he was giving up, that he had not been coerced, that he was not under the influence of medication or alcohol and that he did, in fact, sell cocaine as charged. Accordingly, we find that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Tinkham, 273 AD2d 619, 620, lv denied 95 NY2d 872; People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769, lv denied 89 NY2d 919).
Finally, we reject defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Before removing himself from the case because of a conflict, defendant’s original counsel filed an extensive pretrial omnibus motion, challenging the validity of the search warrant, as well as the credibility of the confidential informant, and requesting various pretrial hearings (see, People v Mateo, 252 AD2d 821, 821-822, lv denied 92 NY2d 927). After unsuccessfully attempting to suppress the photo identification through a Wade hearing, defendant’s new counsel secured a very favorable plea agreement, especially considering defendant’s potential exposure to substantial prison time. We, therefore, conclude that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404; People v Crippa, 245 AD2d 811, 812, lv denied 92 NY2d 850).

"Malone Jr., J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Czajka, J.), rendered May 25, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was indicted on two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree arising out of his alleged possession and sale of methadone. Upon defendant’s motion, County Court (Bruhn, J.) ordered that the criminal sale counts be reduced to the lesser included crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to all of the counts in the indictment. At sentencing, County Court (Czajka, J.) was erroneously advised that the criminal possession counts had been dismissed. County Court accordingly sentenced defendant upon the criminal sale counts, as agreed, to concurrent prison terms of two years, and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate the judgment of conviction leaves his challenge to the voluntariness of his plea unpreserved (see People v Terry, 55 AD3d 1149, 1150 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 931 [2009]). Nor did “the plea colloquy negate[ ] an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation requirement” (id.). In any event, we are satisfied from our review of the record that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea.
Defendant’s claim that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel, to the extent that alleged ineffective assistance affected the voluntariness of his plea, is similarly unpreserved given his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]). In any event, defendant was made well aware of the charged crimes and his sentencing exposure during his plea colloquy and stated his satisfaction with counsel, and we conclude that defendant received meaningful representation (see id.).
Defendant also argues that, given the lack of proof as to his knowledge of the weight of the methadone that he possessed and sold, County Court should have dismissed the indictment. That knowledge, however, is not an element of any charged offense (see Penal Law § 15.20 [4]; People v Estrella, 303 AD2d 689 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 571 [2003]; People v Wilson, 245 AD2d 402, 402 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 946 [1998]). Defendant’s related argument that there was insufficient evidence to indict him upon the original criminal sale counts is waived by his guilty plea (see People v Dunbar, 53 NY2d 868, 871 [1981]; People v Melendez, 48 AD3d 960, 960 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 962 [2008]) and, in any event, those counts were appropriately reduced by County Court (see CPL 210.20 [1-a]).
Lastly, we are unpersuaded that the sentence imposed, which was agreed upon by the parties and included the minimum prison term allowed and a permissible period of postrelease supervision, was harsh and excessive (see People v Nelson, 51 AD3d 1137, 1138 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 739 [2008]).

"Peters, J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered February 4, 2002, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and bail jumping in the first degree.
In October 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of two indictments charging her with multiple drug-related felonies. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant waived her right to appeal and was to be sentenced to a prison term of 4 to 15 years. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing a warrant was issued for her arrest. Two years later, defendant was located in California and extradited to New York, where she was arraigned on bail jumping in the first degree. Defendant thereafter moved to withdraw her plea on the ground that her counsel coerced her to plead guilty. Following a hearing, County Court denied the motion. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to bail jumping in the first degree and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 8 to 24 years on the criminal sale and criminal possession convictions and 21/s to 7 years on the bail jumping conviction. She now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal precludes her from asserting ineffective assistance of counsel except to the extent that it allegedly impacted the voluntariness of her plea (see People v Stone, 9 AD3d 498, 498-499 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 712 [2004]; People v Clifford, 295 AD2d 697, 698 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 709 [2002]). In this regard, defendant contends that her counsel coerced her to plead guilty to the drug charges. A review of the record, however, does not substantiate her assertions.
During the plea colloquy, County Court advised defendant of the terms of the plea, including the appeal waiver, and fully informed her of her rights. Defendant indicated that she understood the rights that she was relinquishing by entering a guilty plea and had not been coerced or threatened to do so. She further stated that she had discussed the plea with her attorney and was satisfied with counsel’s representation. Defendant then admitted that she sold cocaine to an undercover informant on three separate occasions and possessed cocaine on a fourth occasion. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see People v Collins, 306 AD2d 695 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 619 [2003]), and we find her guilty plea to be voluntary, knowing and intelligent (see People v Hodge, 4 AD3d 676, 677 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 800 [2004]). We decline to review defendant’s challenge to the severity of her sentence given her voluntary, intelligent and knowing plea and waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Thigpen, 12 AD3d 934, 935 [2004]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

"McCarthy, J.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to four years in prison on the criminal sale charge, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision, 2 to 4 years in prison on the criminal possession of a weapon charge and one year in jail on the drug paraphernalia charge, all of which were to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we note that because defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the voluntariness and facial sufficiency of his plea is unpreserved for our review (see People v Jenks, 69 AD3d 1120, 1121 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 841 [2010]). Contrary to defendant’s contention, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is inapplicable here, as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that tended to negate a material element of the crimes or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v White, 84 AD3d 1641, 1642 [2011]; People v Davis, 84 AD3d 1645, 1646 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 815 [2011]). As for defendant’s claim that the recitation of the facts in connection with the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (see Penal Law § 265.02 [1]) did not establish that the semi-automatic handgun was operable, “we note that the exception to the preservation rule applies only where a recitation of facts casts significant doubt on a defendant’s guilt and not, as here, where ‘the sufficiency of the articulation of the element is challenged’ ” (People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011], quoting People v Vonderchek, 245 AD2d 979, 980 [1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 945 [1998]). To the extent that any of defendant’s arguments are preserved, we find that defendant’s responses to County Court’s inquiries sufficiently established both defendant’s guilt and that he entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea.

"— Cardona, P.J.
Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), entered March 20, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his conviction of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and unlawful possession of marihuana, without a hearing.
In affirming defendant’s conviction on direct appeal, one of the issues this Court found to be unpersuasive was his contention that the imposition of consecutive sentences was harsh and excessive (People v Hawkins, 45 AD3d 989 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1034 [2008]). Defendant now appeals, by permission of this Court, from County Court’s denial of his CPL 440.20 motion wherein he argued that the imposition of consecutive sentences on two of the counts — third degree criminal possession of a weapon and fourth degree criminal possession of a controlled substance — was illegal under Penal Law § 70.25 (2).
Inasmuch as a claim that a sentence is harsh and excessive is distinct from a challenge to the legality of a sentence (see generally People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 9 [1989]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Espino, 279 AD2d 798, 799 [2001]), we agree with defendant that County Court incorrectly denied his motion on the ground that the issue of illegal sentence was previously raised on defendant’s direct appeal. Nonetheless, upon reviewing the merits of that claim in the interest of judicial economy, we find it unpersuasive. Contrary to defendant’s argument, consecutive sentences on the “weapon possession and drug possession charges were legal, as those are separate and distinct possessory offenses regardless of defendant’s possession of both drugs and a weapon at the same time” (People v Smith, 309 AD2d 1081, 1083 [2003]; see People v Almeida, 39 NY2d 823, 824 [1976]).
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been examined and found to be without merit.

"Clark, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (McGinty, J.), rendered September 11, 2012, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.
In January 2010, the dispatcher at the Kingston City Police Department received a telephone call from an individual who claimed to be watching a man on the street who had just placed a handgun in his waistband. The unidentified caller stated that the man was black and was wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and white sneakers. Police proceeded to the area and observed defendant, who largely fit that description, getting into a taxi. The taxi was followed and, several minutes later, was pulled over by a marked patrol car. Defendant bolted from the taxi and was pursued by police, who eventually apprehended him and found him to be in possession of a stun gun and a magazine of ammunition for a .45 caliber handgun. A further search of the area disclosed a .45 caliber handgun approximately 15 to 20 yards from where defendant had been taken into custody.
Subsequently, defendant was indicted on various weapons charges as a result of the incident, and sought to suppress the physical evidence recovered. County Court conducted a suppression hearing and denied that application. Thereafter, pursuant to an agreement resolving the weapons charges as well as an unrelated indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. In March 2011, County Court sentenced defendant, as agreed, to an aggregate prison term of six years to be followed by post-release supervision of five years. After learning that defendant should have been sentenced as a second felony offender, County Court summoned defendant before it for resentencing in September 2012. County Court then denied defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, found him to be a second felony offender, and resentenced him to a sentence identical to that originally imposed.
Defendant now appeals from the resentencing, solely arguing that County Court’s suppression ruling was erroneous. Inasmuch as “defendant never filed a timely notice of appeal from the original judgment of conviction, he may not challenge the propriety of the suppression ruling on his appeal from the resentence[ ]” (People v Anderson, 151 AD2d 684, 685 [1989]; see CPL 450.30 [3]; People v Jordan, 16 NY3d 845, 846 [2011]; People v Henriquez, 112 AD3d 1060, 1061 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1021 [2014]). Defendant’s remedy, if any, lies in filing an application for a writ of error coram nobis (see People v Syville, 15 NY3d 391, 399-401 [2010]; People v Henriquez, 112 AD3d at 1061 n 3).

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), rendered March 23, 2004, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree after a search of her home revealed methamphetamines. Following County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence seized, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, waived her right to appeal any issues relating to her conviction or sentence, and signed a written waiver instrument to that effect. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to an agreed-upon term of 1 to 3 years in prison and now appeals.
In light of defendant’s knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of her right to appeal from all waivable aspects of this case, she is precluded from now challenging the denial of her suppression motion (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Buchanan, 18 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2005]). Notably, County Court specifically advised defendant during the plea allocution that she was forfeiting her right to suppress any evidence by entering the plea, and defendant indicated that she understood. Moreover, inasmuch as her argument does not impact the voluntariness of her guilty plea, defendant’s valid waiver of appeal also forecloses her claim that defense counsel’s failure to advise the People of her intention to testify before the grand jury amounted to a denial of the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Sayles, 292 AD2d 641, 643 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 681 [2002]; cf.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered March 27, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony drug offender, to a prison term of eight years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s contention on appeal, that he was improperly sentenced as a predicate felony offender, survives his appeal waiver but was not preserved due to his failure to object at sentencing despite an opportunity to do so (see People v Woods, 147 AD3d 1156, 1157 [2017], lv denied 29 NY3d 1089 [June 14, 2017]; People v Lowell, 126 AD3d 1235, 1235 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1167 [2015]). Defendant was advised during the plea allocution that he was, potentially, a persistent felony offender, and thereafter provided with a copy of the predicate felony offender information. At sentencing, defense counsel affirmed that defendant did not wish to controvert the allegations in the information and did not have any constitutional or other challenge to the conviction, and defendant then admitted the conviction. Given these circumstances, we are satisfied that there was substantial compliance with the applicable requirements and that corrective action in the interest of justice is not warranted (see CPL 400.21; People v Woods, 147 AD3d at 1157; People v Melton, 136 AD3d 1069, 1070 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1002 [2016]; People v Jones, 47 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 865 [2008]).

"Mulvey, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered July 31, 2013, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (four counts), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts).
Following an investigation by the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Task Force, defendant was arrested in connection with an alleged conspiracy to possess and sell cocaine and heroin in Albany County, other counties in New York and Vermont. He was charged by two indictments with multiple crimes related to the possession and sale of narcotics. Following a joint jury trial, defendant was convicted of four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (counts 2, 3, 5 and 32), one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (count 6) and five counts of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28). He was sentenced as a second violent felony offender to an aggregate prison term of 87 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant argues that the guilty verdict with regard to counts 2, 3 and 5 for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree was against the weight of the evidence. Upon our independent weight of the evidence review, we first determine whether a different finding would not have been unreasonable and, if not, we “must weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions” (People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348 [2007]; accord People v Wynn, 149 AD3d 1252, 1254 [2017]; see People v Reeves, 124 AD3d 1068, 1068 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1076 [2015]). “Issues of credibility and the weight to accord testimony are matters to be resolved by the trier of fact, who is free to accept or reject any part of the testimony presented” (People v Lancaster, 143 AD3d 1046, 1047 [2016] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted], lv denied 28 NY3d 1147 [2017]; see People v Crooks, 129 AD3d 1207, 1208 [2015], affd 27 NY3d 609 [2016]; People v Lanier, 130 AD3d 1310, 1311 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1009 [2015]).
Several police officers testified to three controlled buy operations involving defendant in March, April and September 2011. James Wood, a detective with the City of Albany Police Department, testified that he directed a confidential informant (hereinafter Cl) to call defendant to arrange the purchase of $1,000 worth of crack cocaine on each of the three separate occasions, and the conversations were recorded. Wood — who was familiar with defendant and his voice from prior interactions — listened in on the calls and identified defendant’s voice on the recordings. Before and after each meeting, Wood searched the Cl for contraband and money. On all three dates, defendant met the Cl at the designated location and, under the supervision of several police officers, the Cl briefly entered defendant’s vehicle, purchased the crack cocaine and then returned to his own vehicle and drove back to police custody. During two of the transactions, other officers, serving as the “eyes” of the operation, identified defendant as the seller. Moreover, during each transaction, the Cl wore a body wire and, despite the poor audio quality of the recordings, Wood was able to identify defendant’s voice on the recordings and translated the coded drug sale language employed. Following each transaction, the Cl returned with a plastic bag containing crack cocaine weighing more than one-half ounce. Viewing all of the evidence in a neutral light, weighing the conflicting testimony and according deference to the jury’s credibility determinations, we find that, even if a different verdict would not have been unreasonable, the weight of the evidence fully supports the challenged convictions (see People v Heard, 92 AD3d 1142, 1143-1144 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 994 [2012]; People v Morris, 25 AD3d 915, 916-918 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 851 [2006]).
Furthermore, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s untimely request for a missing witness charge (see People v Carr, 14 NY3d 808, 809 [2010]). A request for such a charge “must be raised as soon as practicable so that the court can appropriately exercise its discretion and the parties can tailor their trial strategy to avoid substantial possibilities of surprise” (People v Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424, 428 [1986] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; accord People v Turner, 73 AD3d 1282, 1283 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 896 [2010]; see People v Carr, 14 NY3d at 809). Here, while the People listed the Cl as a potential witness in their pretrial discovery, the People did not call the Cl to testify during their chronological presentation of the proof early in this trial regarding the sales involving this Cl, which occurred some two months before the close of proof. Defendant was thus aware that the Cl would not testify at the conclusion of the People’s case, but did not make this charge request until after the close of proof and, thus, the request was untimely (see People v Alexander, 127 AD3d 1429, 1433 [2015], lv denied 25 NY3d 1197 [2015]; People v Turner, 73 AD3d at 1283-1284). Moreover, defense counsel’s closing summation heavily emphasized the People’s failure to call the Cl, despite calling CIs involved in purchases from the codefendants, effectively urging the jury to draw an adverse inference due to the failure to call the Cl (see People v Darby, 72 AD3d 1280, 1283 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 749 [2010]). This ameliorated any prejudice.
Defendant also claims that County Court erred in delivering a supplemental instruction to the deliberating jury prior to a weekend recess without notice to and consultation with counsel, and that the instruction was coercive. We recently addressed and rejected a similar claim in a decision upholding the convictions of codefendant Guy Anderson (People v Anderson, 149 AD3d 1407, 1415-1416 [2017]). We add that defendant’s reliance on CPL 310.30 is misplaced, inasmuch as the instructions before the recess to which defendant objects were not in response to a jury note or inquiry (see CPL 310.10 [2]; compare People v O’Rama, 78 NY2d 270, 276-277 [1991]; People v Morrison, 148 AD3d 1707, 1708 [2017]). Defendant raises no specific criticisms regarding the instruction beyond a general claim that it was improperly coercive, which we reject, having previously concluded that the charge given “ ‘was balanced and neutral in tone, and . . . did not urge any dissenting jurors to abandon their convictions and acquiesce in the opinion of the other jurors, attempt to coerce or compel the jurors to reach a particular verdict, or shame the jurors into reaching a verdict’ ” (People v Anderson, 149 AD3d at 1415, quoting People v Cole man, 64 AD3d 787, 787 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 835 [2009]; see People v Vazquez, 145 AD3d 1268, 1270-1271 [2016]). We also note that, although not conclusive, the jury continued to deliberate and acquitted defendant on two counts and was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count, further undermining any contention that the court’s instruction coerced a verdict (see People v Anderson, 116 AD3d 499, 500-501 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 958 [2014]; compare People v Aponte, 2 NY3d 304, 309 [2004]).
Defendant also argues that a litany of trial errors deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree. Defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to discharge an alternate juror who admitted to having read news articles regarding the case is moot, since, as we have noted in a code-fendant’s appeal, the potential juror did not participate in deliberations (see People v Anderson, 149 AD3d at 1414 n 3; People v Haardt, 129 AD3d 1322, 1322 [2015]; People v Rivera, 7 AD3d 358, 359 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 741 [2004]). Further, upon receiving a note alleging that members of the jury had fallen asleep during portions of the testimony, the court noted that it had not observed any of the jurors sleeping, but nevertheless issued an instruction for the jury to request breaks when necessary. As defendant did not object to this course of action, his claim of error is unpreserved for our review (see People v Blond, 96 AD3d 1149, 1152-1153 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1101 [2012]; People v Busreth, 35 AD3d 965, 967 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 920 [2007]).
Finally, with regard to the sentence, we are persuaded that defendant’s aggregate sentence of 87 years in prison, although legally permissible, should be reduced in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780, 783 [1992]; People v Perry, 70 AD3d 1063, 1065 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 908 [2000]). Considering the circumstances of his crimes and his prior criminal history, we modify defendant’s sentence by directing that the sentences for counts 2, 3, 5 and 32 run concurrently to each other, but consecutively to the other counts, and directing that the sentences for counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 run concurrently to each other, but consecutively to the other counts. Therefore, defendant’s sentence will be an aggregate prison term of 32 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been considered and determined to be lacking in merit.
McCarthy, J.P., Egan Jr., Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that defendant’s sentences for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree under counts 2, 3, 5 and 32 of the indictment shall run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the remaining sentences imposed, and that defendant’s sentences for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under counts 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 of the indictment shall run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the other sentences imposed, and, as so modified, affirmed.

. The jury acquitted defendant on one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.

On this appeal defendant argues only that the sentence he received upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree was harsh and excessive. However, he entered his plea knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Furthermore, the plea was in full satisfaction of a four-count indictment.

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years upon his conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and to a consecutive prison term of 1 Vi to 3 years upon his conviction of the crime of bail jumping in the second degree. Defendant contends on this appeal that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was allowed to enter a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of the more serious charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty to both crimes knowing that he could receive the sentences ultimately imposed, which are less than the harshest possible. Given these facts, as well as defendant’s criminal record, we find no basis to disturb the sentences imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

"Spain, J.E
Defendant was charged by indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree after he sold a quantity of cocaine to a confidential informant. In satisfaction of the pending charge, as well as other drug-related charges under investigation in Cortland County, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As a condition of the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal, orally and in writing, after County Court thoroughly explained the appeal waiver to him and he indicated that counsel had answered all of his questions. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to six years in prison followed by IV2 years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s sole challenge on appeal concerns County Court’s decision denying his motion to suppress identification evidence. However, defendant’s valid knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal — which was comprehensive, unqualified and made with the advice of counsel — precludes this appeal from the adverse suppression ruling (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Gentry, 68 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 800 [2010]; People v Muirhead, 67 AD3d 1258, 1259 [2009]; People v Pump, 67 AD3d 1041, 1041 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 941 [2010]).

As part of his plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, defendant waived his right to appeal from the judgment of conviction. Insofar as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, we find that he is precluded from challenging the sufficiency of the plea on this appeal. Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits, we would find that the plea was knowing and voluntary. Furthermore, we reject defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed of 1 to 3 years in prison was harsh and excessive. The sentence was in accordance with the plea agreement, in which defendant pleaded guilty to a class D felony after being charged with a class B felony, and was within statutory parameters. Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb it.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County, rendered September 10, 1975, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of bail jumping in the first degree and from a judgment of the same court, rendered September 26, 1975, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant, after arraignment in Ithaca City Court on drug possession charges, jumped bail. While at large he was indicted for bail jumping in the first degree and, by separate indictment, charged with three drug charges, including possession of heroin with intent to sell. (Penal Law, § 220.16, subd 1.) He was arrested and convicted after jury trial of bail jumping in the first degree (Penal Law, § 215.57). Thereafter, but prior to sentencing on the bail jumping conviction, he entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and, after lengthy plea bargaining, was sentenced to four years to life on the drug charge and to an indeterminate sentence not to exceed four years on the bail jumping conviction, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appeals from the judgment of September 26, 1975 sentencing him to four years to life upon his plea of guilty to the class A felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree on the ground that he did not freely and voluntarily enter his plea of guilty. A review of the record reveals evidence of extensive plea bargaining between the District Attorney’s ofiiee and counsel for defendant, culminating in a letter from the District Attorney to defendant’s lawyer advising that the People, at sentencing, would recommend the minimum sentence for a class A-III felony. At sentencing, the People fulfilled their promise, but the court advised defendant that the District Attorney’s recommendation was not binding on it and that a sentence appropriate to the crime would be imposed after a consideration of all relevant factors, including a presentencing probation report. The defendant replied that he understood. Extensive dialogue followed concerning the alternate sentences authorized by statute and defendant indicated that he was aware of and appreciated the distinctions. The Court of Appeals in People v Francis {38 NY2d 150, 153, 154) set forth the circumstances that might alert a Judge to the fact that a defendant’s plea is inappropriate. None of those facts are present herein (see People v Hayes, 55 AD2d 691). Next, there is no requirement that a Judge conduct a pro forma inquisition in each case to determine if a defendant, adequately represented by counsel, and who admits the underlying facts, as here, may nevertheless not know what he is doing (cf. People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338). Something must trigger such an inquiry (People v Francis, supra). A plea is a bargain struck between a defendant and a prosecutor, both of whom may be in doubt as to a trial’s outcome, and where, as here, the court which accepts the plea has no reason to believe it is unfair or inappropriate, the bargain becomes final (p 156). Since the sentence imposed on the drug conviction was not excessive (cf. People v Caputo, 13 AD2d 861) and no grounds attacking the bail jumping conviction are raised on appeal, the judgments should be affirmed. Judgments affirmed. Koreman, P.

"Spain, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered July 20, 2002, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In full satisfaction of a five-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. A waiver of the right to appeal was recited as a term of the plea, although there is no written waiver. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to 6V2 years to life in prison. Previously, this Court rejected an Anders brief (29 AD3d 1076 [2006]) and new counsel was assigned, and we now affirm.
Initially, upon our review of the record, we find that defendant’s oral waiver of appeal is not enforceable as the plea minutes do not adequately establish that defendant understood that “the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Guthinger, 36 AD3d 1075, 1076 [2007]; People v Trotter, 28 AD3d 947, 948-949 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006]; People v Barton, 28 AD3d 943, 944 [2006]). Also, the record does not reflect that defense counsel explained the appeal waiver to defendant or that defendant expressly waived that right (see People v Edwards, 37 AD3d 871 [2007]; People v Crowley, 34 AD3d 866, 866-867 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 924 [2006]; People v Phillips, 28 AD3d 939, 939 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 761 [2006]; cf. People v Nason, 31 AD3d 818, 819 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 869 [2006]).
Defendant’s contention that her guilty plea was not voluntar ily, knowingly and intelligently entered has not been preserved for our review, given that she never moved to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d 643, 643 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Bennett, 24 AD3d 975, 975 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 831 [2006]), and her challenge to the effectiveness of her counsel is similarly not preserved (see People v Coles, 13 AD3d 665, 666 [2004]). In any event, were we to consider these issues, we would find that the plea minutes reflect that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Defendant was advised of her rights and stated on the record that she understood the consequences of the plea, she had ample time to consult with her attorney, and she was satisfied with her attorney’s representation (see People v Robetoy, 21 AD3d 1220, 1220 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 758 [2005] ; People v Threatt, 16 AD3d 706, 707 [2005]; People v Hill, 11 AD3d 817, 818 [2004]). Moreover, in negotiating a favorable plea agreement and throughout the proceedings, counsel provided defendant with meaningful representation (see People v Cain, 29 AD3d 1032, 1033 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 786 [2006] ).
Reviewing defendant’s remaining contentions, she inaccurately argues that County Court erred in denying her request for a Darden hearing. In fact, the court in its written decision expressly reserved decision on the request until after the suppression hearing (subject to defendant’s renewed request) and defendant never made any renewed request before pleading guilty. Thus, by pleading guilty while the motion was still pending, defendant waived appellate review of that issue (see People v Atwood, 9 AD3d 512, 513 [2004]; People v Deliz, 172 AD2d 877, 878-879 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 921 [1991]; cf. CPL 470.05 [2]).
In any event, at the suppression hearing, the identity of the informant whose statement supported the warrant application was revealed, thereby obviating the need for an in camera hearing to establish the existence of the informant or to protect her identity (see People v Edwards, 95 NY2d 486, 492-494 [2000]; People v Serrano, 93 NY2d 73, 77 [1999]). Further, the hearing testimony established that the warrant application sufficiently demonstrated the reliability and basis of knowledge of the informant (see People v Griminger, 71 NY2d 635, 639 [1988]), as it was supported by her sworn statement to police—containing admissions against her penal interest (see People v Walker, 27 AD3d 899, 900 [2006]), lv denied 7 NY3d 764 [2006])—which was corroborated by information gained earlier from two other confidential informants and confirmed by police investigation (see People v Collins, 35 AD3d 896, 897-898 [2006]; see also People v Bahr, 35 AD3d 909 [2006]). Thus, probable cause for the warrant was established (see People v Alston, 1 AD3d 627, 628-629, [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 594 [2004]; see also People v Rodriguez, 52 NY2d 483, 489-490 [1981]).
Finally, finding no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances to warrant modification of the bargained-for sentence, we decline to disturb it in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; see also People v Rutledge, 282 AD2d 870 [2001]). Defendant’s contentions regarding the amendments to the Rockefeller drug laws as they pertain to class A-II felons are appropriately made to the sentencing court (see Penal Law § 70.71; see also People v Syrell, 31 AD3d 881, 882 [2006]).

"Aarons, J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered March 24, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and the plea agreement included the waiver of the right to appeal. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a prior felony offender, to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, his waiver of the right to appeal was valid. County Court explained that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from the rights forfeited by a guilty plea and confirmed that defendant understood the ramifications of the waiver. Defendant thereafter executed a counseled written waiver in open court. Under these circumstances, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence (see People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1195-1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Koumjian, 101 AD3d 1175, 1175 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1100 [2013]).

Defendant’s only contention on this appeal is that the 7 to 14-year prison sentence he received is harsh and excessive. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment and another pending five-count indictment, as well as any other charges pending against defendant in Montgomery County. In addition, defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed, which is less than the harshest possible sentence.

We affirm. Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. The record reflects that County Court explained the nature of the right being waived “without lumping that right into the panoply , of trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 257 [2006]; accord People v Jackson, 48 AD3d 885, 885 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 960 [2008]). Further, defendant expressed his understanding of the ramifications of the waiver and thereafter executed two written waivers in open court acknowledging the scope of the right waived and that he had been given sufficient time to discuss the waivers with counsel (see People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1231 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]; People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d 1122, 1123 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 925 [2009]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant validly waived the right to appeal (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Winters, 73 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 811 [2010]).
Defendant’s challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea is foreclosed by his wavier of the right to appeal (see People v Swindell, 72 AD3d 1340, 1341 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 778 [2010]; People v Vaughns, 70 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]). Although defendant’s claim that his plea was involuntary survives his waiver of the right to appeal, the claim is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not triggered here inasmuch as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of either crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt (see People v Thompson, 70 AD3d 1123 [2010]; People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251 [2009]).
Regarding defendant’s challenge to the restitution order, the record reveals that the terms of the plea agreement included the amount of restitution, and defendant did not request a hearing or otherwise contest the amount ordered. Accordingly, his contention that the sum awarded is not supported by the record is both barred by his waiver of the right to appeal and unpreserved for our review (see People v Gilmour, 61 AD3d at 1124). Finally, defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Board, 75 AD3d 833, 834 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County, rendered August 13, 1975, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law, § 220.39). The defendant was indicated on March 5, 1975 in a two-count indictment charging the sale to which he pled guilty and possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law, § 220.16). Both charges were classified as A-III felonies and the sentence therefor had to be a minimum of ""not less than one year nor more than eight years four months” with a mandatory maximum of life (Penal Law, § 70.00). The indictment charged the defendant with both the possession and sale as having occurred on January 17, 1975. On May 19, 1975 the defendant and his assigned counsel appeared in County Court and recited an agreement whereby the defendant would enter a plea of guilty to the first charge (selling) and the second count (possession) would be dismissed with the District Attorney to recommend a minimum of three years. The District Attorney confirmed the agreement and the court stated that it would follow the recommendation of three years. After the foregoing occurred in chambers, the proceedings were formalized in open court. The defendant was 23 years of age and he acknowledged that he understood the prior negotiations and agreements. The court asked him if he had sold heroin on January 17, 1975 to someone and he said ""yes” and that he was saying yes because it was true. The court accepted the guilty plea and set August 13, 1975 for sentencing. The sole issue is whether or not the court erred in denying the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On August 13, 1975 the defendant and his counsel advised the court that since pleading guilty the defendant had learned that many drug offenders had been given minimum sentences of only one year and, therefore, he felt the sentence agreed to was harsh. The defendant then recited that he did not sell the drugs but was only an agent, but he did admit to receiving consideration and giving the drugs to someone else. Upon the present record it appears that the sole reason the defendant wanted to withdraw his plea of guilty was because he had then come to believe the agreed sentence was harsh. He had not been misled by anyone and while he now thought he might dispute his guilt, no facts had changed. This is not a case where the agreed sentence is upon its face improvident and it is well established that the plea of guilty was voluntarily and knowingly entered. While the court at the time of accepting the plea did not elicit the underlying facts in great detail, subsequent events at the time defendant wanted to withdraw that plea made it apparent that he was intimately aware of all the facts relevant to guilt. Upon the present record, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Castellino, J.), rendered January 5, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received of 4 to 12 years is harsh and excessive. The record indicates that further charges were not brought against defendant as a result of the plea agreement. Furthermore, the sentence was in accord with the plea bargain. Under these circumstances, along with the fact that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]), we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).
By failing to move to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the sentence in the trial court, defendant has failed to preserve for appellate review his claim that the misapprehension of County Court as to the availability of lifetime probation affected the voluntary nature of his plea (see, People v Brownell, 140 AD2d 755, lv denied 72 NY2d 916). In any event, defendant’s contention that lifetime probation was an option in this case is without merit in light of the fact that the People did not recommend such a sentence (see, Penal Law § 65.00 [1] [b]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered August 30, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the second degree, defendant entered a plea of guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. At the plea proceeding, the prosecutor explained that, pursuant to the plea bargain, “the sentence would be decided at the time of sentencing after the Court has the Presentence Investigation Report and any other information that the People and defense submit.” Defense counsel advised County Court that “the proposed plea bargain that [the] District Attorney * * * has placed on the record is consistent with what we have previously discussed.”
In contrast, at sentencing the prosecutor described the plea bargain as including an agreement that the sentence would be a prison term of eight years to life “unless the defendant provided valuable cooperation and gave the court reason to give him a lesser sentence.” Contending that defendant had not provided the required “valuable cooperation,” the prosecutor urged that the sentence be eight years to life. Arguing that the police had failed to contact defendant with regard to the “valuable cooperation” condition and that there were various factors which warranted leniency, defense counsel sought a lesser term of imprisonment. Concluding that defendant should be sentence “as agreed,” County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years to life. Defendant appeals, claiming, inter alia, that it was impermissible to hold him to the terms of an alleged plea agreement which was not placed on the record.
Although defendant executed a written waiver of the right to appeal, he was not advised on the record of the maximum sentence he faced prior to executing that waiver and, therefore, the waiver does not encompass his right to challenge his sentence on appeal (see, People v Shea, 254 AD2d 512, 513). Turning to the merits, we conclude that under the circumstances presented here, County Court erred in relying on the terms of an agreement which were not placed on the record. The Court of Appeals has “repeatedly emphasized the necessity of placing all promises on the record, in order to assure the continued validity and usefulness of the plea bargaining process in our criminal justice system” (Matter of Benjamin S., 55 NY2d 116, 120). Thus, “[i]t is a settled rule of law in this State that off-the-record promises made in the plea bargaining process will not be recognized where they are flatly contradicted by the record, either by the existence of some on-the-record promise whose terms are inconsistent with those later urged or by the placement on the record of a statement by the pleading defendant that no other promises have been made to induce his guilty plea” (id. at 120; see, People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169, 173-174).
In this case, the claimed off-the-record agreement fixing a specific sentence subject to reduction if defendant provided “valuable cooperation” is inconsistent with the parties’ representations on the record of the plea proceeding that the sentence would be determined by County Court at the time of sentencing based upon the court’s review of the presentence report and other material submitted by the People and the defense. At sentencing, a dispute arose over what was required of defendant to comply with the “valuable cooperation” condition of the off-the-record agreement, underscoring—once again—“the need to have all relevant terms of a plea agreement * * * placed upon the record” (People v Danny G., supra at 174). Thus, County Court should not have accorded any weight to the alleged off-the-record agreement in sentencing defendant, (see, People v Huertas, 85 NY2d 898, 899; People v Sloan, 228 AD2d 974, lv denied 88 NY2d 1024; People v Salvagni, 199 AD2d 680). The appropriate remedy is to vacate the sentence and remit the matter for resentencing before a different judge.

Upon pleading guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 4 Vi to 9 years. The only contention that defendant raises on this appeal is that his sentence is harsh and excessive. Not only did defendant receive the most lenient prison sentence authorized by statute, but it was the one to which he agreed at the time of his plea.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 22, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant contends that his sentence as a second felony offender to IV2 to 3 years’ imprisonment was harsh and excessive. Defendant was allowed to plead guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a superior court information that charged a more serious crime. Defendant pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed, which was the most lenient possible sentence. Given these facts, and defendant’s extensive criminal history, we find no basis upon which to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Martinez, 184 AD2d 885; People v Pardoe, 147 AD2d 820).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered June 1, 2011, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging her with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. The terms of the plea agreement further provided that if defendant successfully completed a six-month period of interim probation, she would be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea and enter a plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and be sentenced to five years of probation. However, if defendant failed to successfully complete the period of interim probation, she was advised that she would be subject to a prison sentence of up to 5V2 years followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant also waived her right to appeal as a part of the plea agreement. After defendant was found to be in violation of the terms of the plea agreement based upon her admitted failure to comply with the terms of her interim probation, County Court imposed a prison sentence of five years to be followed by two years of post-release supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that she made a valid waiver of the right to appeal. County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited upon defendant’s guilty plea and defendant signed a written appeal waiver in open court acknowledging that counsel discussed the waiver with her and that she was waiving the right knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently (see People v Martinez-Velazquez, 89 AD3d 1318, 1319 [2011]; People v Wicks, 83 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 810 [2011]). To the extent that defendant argues that her guilty plea was involuntary, the record contains no indication that defendant preserved this argument by a motion to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and there is nothing in the record that would trigger the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Secore, 102 AD3d 1059, 1060 [2013]; People v Wicks, 83 AD3d at 1224). Finally, in light of defendant’s valid waiver of the right to appeal, her complaints regarding counsel’s representation are precluded, except to the extent that they implicate the voluntariness of her plea and, to that extent, they are unpreserved and meritless (see People v Walker, 84 AD3d 1643, 1643-1644 [2011]; People v Belle, 74 AD3d 1477, 1480 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 918 [2010]).

In February 2001, defendant pleaded guilty to a one-count superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and the People recommended an indeterminate sentence of D/s to 4 years in prison. Supreme Court accepted the People’s recommendation and sentenced defendant accordingly. Defendant appeals, contending that his plea allocution was factually insufficient and that the sentence was harsh and excessive.
Because defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution is not preserved for our review (see People v Greene, 274 AD2d 842, 843, Iv denied 95 NY2d 963; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, 797, Iv denied 93 NY2d 980). Inasmuch as nothing said during the colloquy cast significant doubt on defendant’s guilt, the narrow exception to this preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636). In any event, we find no merit to defendant’s contentions. While defendant now asserts that he never admitted possession of or control over the cocaine, our review of the record discloses that during the plea allocution, after being fully informed of his rights, defendant acknowledged that he had knowingly and unlawfully possessed cocaine weighing 500 milligrams or more on the specific date, time and place charged. Therefore, Supreme Court properly accepted his guilty plea.
Moreover, defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal forecloses his challenge to the severity of his sentence (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763), which was, in any event, validly imposed pursuant to defendant’s plea agreement (see People v Grant, 294 AD2d 671, 672-673). Our review of the rec ord reveals no abuse of discretion by Supreme Court or any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a modification in the interest of justice (see People v Vazquez, 284 AD2d 730, 730).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered August 16, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In September 1993, defendant was indicted and charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree for selling cocaine to undercover law enforcement agents on two separate occasions. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 5 to 10 years in prison and this appeal ensued.
Initially, insofar as the record discloses that defendant entered into a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal in connection with the plea agreement (see, People v Muniz, 215 AD2d 881, 883), we find no merit to defendant’s contention that this waiver should be given no effect. In any event, although defendant now challenges the restitution ordered to reimburse funds expended in the ""buy and bust” operation leading to his conviction, we note that defendant expressly agreed to this amount (see, People v Serafini, 213 AD2d 1066, lv denied 85 NY2d 980). Further, we find no reason to conclude that the subject order of restitution pursuant to Penal Law § 60.27 (9) was illegal simply because it was the District Attorney’s office that originally provided the funds that were expended by the law enforcement personnel involved in the undercover operation. In our view the legislative purpose of ""preventing] convicted narcotics offenders from reaping a windfall” (Mem of Senate Sponsor, L 1991, ch 545, 1991 NY Legis Ann, at 300) was fulfilled in this case. Finally, we have examined defendant’s claim that his negotiated sentence is harsh and excessive and find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Martin, 215 AD2d 942, 942-943).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Mazzone, J.), rendered August 24, 1989, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
In arguing that the consecutive prison terms she received of 1 ½ to 4½ years were harsh and excessive, defendant claims that the waiver of her right to appeal was invalid because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made. The record, however, establishes that the waiver was part of a negotiated plea and that defendant fully understood the consequences of the waiver (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; People v Brown, 160 AD2d 1039). Even were we to address this issue, it would be rejected. The terms of imprisonment were well within the statutory limits, the sentence was imposed in accordance with the plea-bargain agreement, and the plea was entered in full satisfaction of a 27-count indictment and a three-count indictment.

Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to no more than four years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. At sentencing, County Court imposed upon defendant, as a second felony offender, a sentence of four years in prison with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Inasmuch as defendant failed to object that the period of post-release supervision imposed at sentencing did not conform to the term indicated during the plea proceeding, his claim is unpreserved for our review (see People v Young, 85 AD3d 1489, 1491 [2011]; People v Davis, 79 AD3d 1267, 1269 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 797 [2011]). Our review of the record, however, reveals that County Court specifically expressed its intent during the sentencing proceeding to impose the sentence that was agreed upon during the plea proceeding, which included a two-year period of postrelease supervision. Given these circumstances, we will exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction (see CPL 470.15 [6]) and modify the sentence imposed by sentencing defendant to the agreed-upon sentence of four years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision. We note that since County Court found the agreed-upon sentence to be appropri ate, defendant need not be provided an opportunity to withdraw his plea as our modification “gives effect to the promise which had originally induced defendant’s plea” (People v Martin, 17 AD3d 775, 776 [2005]).

Initially, inasmuch as the record reflects that the appeal waiver explicitly excluded a challenge as to the fine imposed, the issue is properly before this Court (see People v Scott, 74 AD3d 1582, 1582 [2010]). Nevertheless, defendant was informed during the plea colloquy of the potential fine that could be imposed and we find that the imposition of the maximum allowable fine was a provident exercise of County Court’s discretion (see Penal Law § 80.00 [1] [a]; People v Shultis, 61 AD3d 1116, 1118 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 929 [2009]), and we discern no basis in the record to disturb it.

Appeals from two judgments of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered September 14, 1992, (1) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and (2) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On his appeal, defendant argues only the severity of his sentence of concurrent prison terms of 6 to 12 years imposed upon his plea of guilty of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. A sentence of 3 to 9 years, to be served concurrently with the 6- to 12-year terms, was also imposed as a result of the revocation of defendant’s probation relating to a prior conviction. The sentences were those promised by County Court if defendant pleaded guilty to the pending drug sale charges and defendant made no objection to the arrangement.
We find no reason to disturb or modify the sentence imposed. Defendant faced potential consecutive prison sentences of 12 Vi to 25 years on each felony and 5 to 15 years on the probation violation. Thus, defendant was benefited by his plea bargain and also by the dismissal of a criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree charge that was pending in Hudson City Court. In the circumstances, we find the sentences to be fair and reasonable. We find no vindictiveness, harshness or excessiveness.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Ames, J.), rendered August 13, 2013, convict ing defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, and his plea included the waiver of the right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of four years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Sentencing was adjourned and defendant was released to get his affairs in order, with the requirement that he was to report to jail one week later. Defendant failed to report to jail and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant was subsequently arrested on a new charge of criminal contempt in the second degree. Defendant thereafter agreed to be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of five years, with two years of postrelease supervision, on his plea of guilty to unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, with the understanding that the enhanced sentence would satisfy the criminal contempt charge, as well as any other pending charges. The agreement also included a waiver of the right to appeal. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence and defendant appeals.
We affirm. Initially, we agree with defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, inasmuch as the record does not demonstrate that defendant understood that the appeal waiver was separate and distinct from the rights automatically forfeited by a guilty plea (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 263-264 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Although defendant’s sole remaining claim—that his sentence was harsh and excessive—is properly before us, we find it unpersuasive. Defendant was advised at the time that he entered his plea of the consequences of being arrested while on release, and he waived any challenges regarding the enhanced sentence in exchange for the promise that his plea would satisfy both the new charge and any pending charges (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Lord, 128 AD3d 1277, 1278-1279 [2015]). In light of the foregoing, as well as defendant’s extensive criminal history, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence (see People v Kerwin, 117 AD3d 1097, 1098 [2014]; People v Williams, 101 AD3d 1174, 1174-1175 [2012]).

"— Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Monserrate, J.), rendered September 7, 1990 in Broome County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
We reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence he received as a second felony offender of 2Vz to 5 years was harsh or excessive. The sentence was well within the statutory guidelines and was in accordance with the plea bargain (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899). Given defendant’s extensive criminal background and the fact that the plea was to a reduced charge, we find no basis for disturbing the sentence imposed (see, People v Dean, 155 AD2d 774, lv denied 75 NY2d 812).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered March 12, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and grand larceny in the fourth degree.
After defendant sold cocaine, an indictment was handed up charging him with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. A separate indictment charged him with two counts of grand larceny in the fourth degree for his theft of two shotguns. Subsequently, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of grand larceny in the fourth degree in satisfaction of both indictments. Pursuant to that plea, defendant executed waivers of appeal. County Court thereafter imposed concurrent sentences of two years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision for the criminal sale of a controlled substance conviction and lVs to 4 years in prison for the grand larceny conviction. County Court also ordered defendant to pay restitution to the victim of the grand larceny. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s valid waiver of appeal precludes us from addressing his argument that his agreed-upon sentence is harsh and excessive (see People v Houck, 74 AD3d 1476,1477 [2010]; People v Walley, 63 AD3d 1284, 1286 [2009]). While surviving his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant’s contention that his plea was rendered involuntary by the ineffective assistance of counsel is unpreserved for our review due to defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Davis, 74 AD3d 1490, 1490 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 850 [2010]; People v Volfson, 69 AD3d 1123, 1124 [2010]; People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251-1252 [2009]).
County Court erred by setting a restitution amount without conducting a restitution hearing because there was insufficient evidence to determine the victim’s loss. Because the plea agreement required defendant to pay restitution but did not contain the specific amount to be paid, defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from challenging the restitution order (see People v Empey, 73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 804 [2010]; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d 1231, 1232 [2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 893 [2010]). Defendant preserved this challenge when counsel questioned the amount of restitution at sentencing (see People v Horne, 97 NY2d 404, 414 n 3 [2002]; People v Empey, 73 AD3d at 1389; People v Thomas, 71 AD3d at 1232).
As to the merits of defendant’s argument, a restitution hearing must be held where the record lacks sufficient evidence for a court to determine the amount of restitution ordered or the defendant requests such a hearing (see Penal Law § 60.27 [2]). A trial court may not rely entirely on the Probation Department’s recommendations when ordering restitution (see People v Fuller, 57 NY2d 152, 158-159 [1982]; People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 145 [1996]; People v Pelkey, 63 AD3d 1188, 1190 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 748 [2009]). Here, County Court did just that by ordering “restitution in the amount of $1,460.96, per the probation report.” The only record support for this amount came from the presentence investigation report, which was based solely on a letter received from the victim of the larceny. No other evidence is contained in the record to support the amount of damages requested by the victim. In fact, the victim claimed that he was entitled to $700 to have the barrel of his gun replaced and new fiber optic sights put on, but the felony complaint alleged that defendant stole a shotgun with a slug barrel and glow sights valued at approximately $600. Not only is it unclear why the barrel needs to be replaced but,, at sentenc ing, defense counsel aptly noted that the value of the replacement barrel was higher than the value of the entire gun. Additionally, the victim sought — and received — $760.96 for five lost days of work, but it is unclear who lost days from work, what that person’s daily wage was, and how those days were related to defendant’s offense. For example, the victim’s letter, attached to the presentence investigation report, states that the victim’s wife took at least one day off from work before even discovering that the shotguns were missing. As County Court relied solely on the presentence investigation report, which is itself based on insufficient evidence to uphold the restitution ordered, a hearing is required to determine the appropriate amount of restitution (see People v Travis, 64 AD3d 808, 808-809 [2009]; People v Pelkey, 63 AD3d at 1190-1191; People v Monette, 199 AD2d 589 [1993]).

Although defendant agreed, as part of his plea bargain, “to make any reasonable amount of restitution that may be requested by the victim without the necessity of a hearing,” we do not consider defendant to have given up his right to a hearing here because it is unclear whether the amount requested was reasonable (see People v Consalvo, 89 NY2d 140, 144-145 [1996]).",,909,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered December 3, 2012, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered February 20, 2013, which resentenced defendant following said convictions, and (3) from a judgment of said court, rendered February 20, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted assault in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted after an undercover officer made five controlled buys of crack cocaine on two occasions from defendant directly and on three other occasions from codefendant Isiah Pickett. At trial, a jury found defendant guilty of five counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of 15 years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision.
In a separate matter, defendant was charged in a four-count indictment pertaining to an incident where he assaulted a man with a tire iron. After his trial on the drug charges, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted assault in the second degree in satisfaction of that indictment. County Court imposed the agreed-upon sentence of 2 to 4 years in prison, to be served concurrently with his sentence on the drug charges. Defendant appeals.
The jury’s verdict on the 10 drug counts was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. Defendant argues that the evidence did not adequately establish his identity as the person involved in any of these transactions, or that he acted in concert with Pickett for three alleged sales. The undercover officer testified and identified defendant as the individual who personally sold him crack cocaine on two occasions. The officer also testified regarding numerous phone calls with defendant to arrange sales of cocaine. During the calls, the undercover officer or a confidential informant referred to defendant by his street name. After three of those calls, wherein defendant indicated that he was not in the area but “his people” were available or Pickett was holding his supply, the officer proceeded to the selected location and engaged in drug purchases from Pickett at the price and amount agreed upon with defendant (see Penal Law § 20.00). Audio recordings of the phone calls and the drug transactions themselves were entered into evidence and played for the jury. Two other police officers testified that they knew defendant’s voice from previous contact and recognized the voice on the phone as defendant’s. This evidence adequately established that defendant personally possessed and sold cocaine on two occasions, and that he acted in concert with Pickett to possess and sell cocaine on three other occasions (see People v Wilkins, 75 AD3d 847, 848 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 857 [2010]; People v Vargas, 72 AD3d 1114, 1117-1118 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 758 [2010]; People v Wilson, 71 AD3d 1333, 1334-1335 [2010]).
County Court gave the jury a missing witness charge concerning the confidential informant. Defendant did not preserve any argument concerning the wording of that charge because he did not object to the charge that was given or request different language (see People v Hawkins, 110 AD3d 1242, 1244 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1041 [2013]; People v Burdick, 266 AD2d 711, 713 [1999]).
Defendant asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his assault matter. To the extent that his claim relates to the voluntariness of his plea, the record does not indicate that he preserved the argument by making an appropriate postallocution motion; to the extent that his claim is unrelated to the voluntariness of the plea, he forfeited such claim by pleading guilty (see People v Lohnes, 112 AD3d 1148, 1150 [2013]).

This is an appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered February 13, 1974, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony, and sentencing him, pursuant to section 70.06 of the Penal Law, as a second felony offender.
On September 17, 1973, defendant was arrested in the City of Albany and charged with criminal possession of marijuana in violation of subdivision 10 of section 220.09 of the Penal Law, a class C felony. Following his indictment and arraignment, he entered a plea of not guilty and moved to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. When this motion was denied, he changed his plea to one of guilty and came on for sentencing.
Prior to the imposition of sentence, it was established that defendant had been convicted of possession of marijuana in Harris County in the State of Texas on March 9, 1972 and that he had been sentenced therefor to five years in prison with the period of confinement suspended and probation imposed for five years. In view of this fact and in an obvious reference to section 70.06 of the Penal Law, the trial court stated at the time of sentencing that it was ""obliged under the circumstances of this case * * * by virtue of the prior felony conviction in the State of Texas” to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to a maximum term of six years and a minimum term of three years in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services.
On this appeal, defendant argues that section 70.06 of the Penal Law is unconstitutional as applied to him because its application denies him the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by both the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const, 14th Arndt; NY Const, art I, § 11) and also results in the delegation of legislative authority by the Senate and Assembly to Legislatures of other jurisdictions in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution. We agree.
Enacted as part of a crime-controlling legislative package aimed at eliminating the illicit trafficking in and consumption of narcotics in this State, the questioned statute herein deals with the sentencing of second felony offenders. In pertinent part it provides that, to be a predicate felony, a prior conviction in a jurisdiction other than New York must have been for an offense for which a term of imprisonment in excess of one year or a sentence of death was authorized, irrespective of whether such sentence was imposed (Penal Law, § 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [i]).
As becomes readily apparent upon a perusal of some of the unusual laws on the statute books of other jurisdictions, the implementation of this provision would serve to deprive defendants with prior out-of-State convictions of the equal protection of the laws. For example, convictions for vagrancy (RI Gen Laws, § 11-45-1), blasphemy (NJ Stat, § 2A: 140-2), or the theft of a turkey (Ark Stat, § 41-3916.1), if obtained in the proper jurisdiction, would mandate second felony offender status under the present statute for one later convicted of a New York felony. That such a result would be purely arbitrary and without a basis in reason is amply demonstrated by the fact that, had defendant fortuitously performed these very same earlier acts in the State of New York, he would still be entitled to first offender status upon his sentencing for his subsequent New York felony conviction.
Defendant’s further argument, that this statute violates the constitutional provision vesting the legislative power of the State of New York in the Senate and Assembly (NY Const, art III, § 1), is likewise persuasive. This power includes the responsibility for prescribing the proper punishment for the various criminal offenses (People v Blanchard, 288 NY 145) and, since it cannot be delegated to any other legislative body (Burke v Kern, 287 NY 203), the term of imprisonment authorized for an offense in another jurisdiction cannot serve as the basis for determining the extent of the punishment to which a defendant is subject upon his felony conviction in New York.
By virtue of the above considerations, we are compelled to declare section 70.06 of the Penal Law unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void, insofar as it. provides that the extent of punishment for a convicted New York felon is dependent upon the authorized sentence for an offense of which he has previously been convicted in another jurisdiction. In so holding we note that the constitutional questions considered herein were previously discussed in a well-reasoned and carefully researched opinion with which we are in complete agreement (People v Mazzie, 78 Misc 2d 1014), and that defendant did not waive his right to mount his constitutional challenge by failing to proceed under CPL 400.21 for a determination as to whether or not he was a second felony offender. Those procedures involve factual determinations as to defendant’s past history of convictions which is not in dispute and has no bearing on the constitutionality of section 70.06 of the Penal Law.
The judgment should be reversed, on the law, to the extent of vacating the sentence imposed on February 13, 1974, and the matter remitted to the County Court of Albany County for resentencing defendant as a first felony offender.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Pelella, J.), rendered January 20, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of grand larceny in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, which also satisfied other outstanding charges, defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to grand larceny in the third degree as charged in a superior court instrument, admitting that he had written checks to a business for which he knew there were insufficient funds in his account. As part of the agreement, he signed a six-page drug treatment court contract that, among other provisions, contained a paragraph waiving the right to appeal. Defendant entered the plea with the understanding that sentencing would be held in abeyance and, if he successfully completed a drug treatment program, he would receive a sentence of five years of probation; he was warned that if he did not comply, he could receive a sentence of imprisonment of up to 2 Vs to 7 years in prison. Defendant was terminated from the drug treatment program for violating conditions of the program and was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant appeals.
Upon review of the record on appeal, we agree with defendant’s contention that his waiver of the right to appeal was not valid as the record does not reflect that he was adequately advised that the right to appeal is “separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-266 [2011]; People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d 861, 862 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1076 [2013]; People v Gilbert, 106 AD3d 1133, 1133 [2013]; compare People v Mydosh, 117 AD3d 1195, 1196 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 963 [2014]; People v Martin, 105 AD3d 1266, 1267 [2013]). While the court informed defendant that the drug treatment contract he signed as part of the plea agreement included an appeal waiver and elicited that he had reviewed it with counsel and understood and agreed to this condition, neither the colloquy nor the contract made clear that the right to appeal “would otherwise survive a guilty plea” and is not “automatically extinguished upon entry of a guilty plea” so as to reflect that “defendant comprehended the nature of the waiver of appellate rights” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 264-267; compare People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 982-983 [2014]; People v Henion, 110 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1088 [2014]; People v Diaz, 72 AD3d 1349, 1350 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]). As the appeal waiver is invalid, defendant is not precluded from challenging the sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255-256), but we find that his arguments in that regard are without merit. He was fully advised of the consequences of noncompliance with the drug treatment contract, including the maximum prison sentence, and was given every opportunity to succeed in drug treatment, where he repeatedly engaged in dishonest and deceitful behavior. Accordingly, we discern no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d at 864).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered October 11, 1996, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant was charged in a nine-count indictment with the commission of multiple felony crimes involving the sale and possession of controlled substances. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to a prison term of seven years to life. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that his plea was not voluntary, knowing or intelligent and should be vacated on the ground that the assistance rendered by his attorneys was ineffective.
Defendant premises his claim of ineffective assistance on the fact that between his arraignment and the plea allocution he was represented by four different attorneys. He concludes that because of this turnover, the case against him could not have been adequately investigated. We find nothing in the record to support his argument.
To the contrary, the record reveals that defendant was adequately represented at all pretrial proceedings. Notably, the attorney ultimately assigned to him successfully negotiated a very favorable plea which enabled defendant to plead guilty to one count of a nine-count indictment and avoid significant additional penal exposure. Moreover, during the plea allocution defendant did not indicate any dissatisfaction with the turnover of counsel or with his current counsel, and denied being threatened, forced or coerced into pleading guilty. In our view, the advantageous plea, combined with the lack of record evidence which would cast doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel, convinces us that the assistance rendered was meaningful (see, People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941; People v Torres, 227 AD2d 716, lvs denied 88 NY2d 995, 996). Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to vacate the conviction.

On June 14, 1985, defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and promoting prison contraband in the first degree. Thereafter, on July 12, 1985, she was indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. This latter indictment related to defendant’s arrest for possession of heroin on December 29, 1984 and on which charges she was arraigned on December 30, 1984. Defendant moved to dismiss the July 12, 1985 indictment on the basis that it was handed down six months and 14 days after arraignment, in violation of defendant’s right to a speedy trial (see, CPL 30.30). County Court denied the motion, and defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. According to the plea agreement, she was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 3Vi to 7 years.
Defendant first contends that County Court erred in denying her speedy trial motion. Initially, we note that while defendant refers to this issue as the constitutional right to a speedy trial (see, US Const 6th and 14th Amends; CPL 30.20), her arguments at the hearing and on this appeal refer to the statutory right to a speedy trial (see, CPL 30.30). To the extent that defendant’s motion was based on the statutory right, defendant’s guilty plea operates as a waiver of this claim (see, People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 6; People v Thill, 52 NY2d 1020, cert denied 454 US 829). Moreover, while a claim based on the constitutional right is not so waived (see, People v Taylor, supra, at 5), a consideration of the factors enumerated in People v Taranovich (37 NY2d 442, 445) demonstrates that defendant was not denied her constitutional right to a speedy trial.
We find without merit defendant’s assertion that the sentence she received is harsh and excessive. As a rule, we will not interfere with County Court’s discretion to impose sentence in the absence of extraordinary circumstances or an abuse of discretion (People v Cyr, 119 AD2d 901, lv denied 68 NY2d 756). Here, defendant was apprised of the sentence to be imposed at the time she entered her plea. In light of the circumstances of this case and defendant’s status as a previously convicted felon, we can discern neither an abuse of discretion nor extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction of defendant’s sentence.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered December 8, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a three-count indictment and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of 2V2 to 5 years in prison. Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive principally due to his troubled upbringing. Notably, where a sentence is within permissible statutory ranges, it shall not be disturbed unless the sentencing court abused its discretion or extraordinary circumstances exist warranting a modification (see, People v Dolphy, 257 AD2d 681, lv denied 93 NY2d 872). Here, we find no abuse of discretion by County Court. Furthermore, upon review of the record and presentence report, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed in the interest of justice (see, id.).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered May 1, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
In satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, and in satisfaction of other related charges, defendant entered a plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to a prison term of 7V2 years to life. The record also reflected that, as a result of defendant’s plea, his girlfriend, an unindicted coconspirator, would be permitted to plead to a crime that would allow a split sentence of imprisonment and probation. During the plea, defendant acknowledged that he was waiving the right to appeal. Sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain, defendant appeals, claiming that his plea was coerced and that his sentence is excessive.
“Although defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal does not in and of itself preclude appellate review of the voluntariness of his plea * * * the issue was not preserved by a motion to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction * * *” (People v Bolden, 287 AD2d 883, 883, lv denied 97 NY2d 654 [citations omitted]). Nor does the record contain anything which would trigger the exception to the preservation rule by casting significant doubt on the voluntariness of defendant’s plea (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666), even in light of the special concern required by the connection between defendant’s plea and the leniency accorded to his girlfriend (see, People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536). With regard to defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence, it is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733). In any event, the record discloses neither an abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed nor any extraordinary circumstances which would warrant a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice (see, People v O’Byrne, 262 AD2d 867, lv denied 93 NY2d 1024).

J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 22, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In October 2013, defendant was arrested after the police, who had observed him with a marihuana cigarette in a vehicle with a codefendant, found a stolen, loaded .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol hidden under his seat. Defendant was subsequently charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. While released on bail awaiting trial on this indictment, defendant was again arrested in February 2014 after police found him inside a motel room with, among other things, approximately 32 grams of heroin, two digital scales, 900 empty glassine envelopes and an air gun replica revolver, and he was charged in a superior court information with, among other things, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Thereafter, pursuant to a plea agreement encompassing both accusatory instruments, defendant waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree with a commitment that County Court would impose a prison sentence with a range of 3V2 to 12 years for the weapons conviction and a maximum of nine years for the drug conviction, with his sentences for each conviction to be served concurrently. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 12 years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision, for his conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and nine years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision, for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant now appeals, contending that the waiver of his right to appeal was invalid and the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
We agree with defendant that he did not validly waive the right to appeal. County Court failed to distinguish “that the right to appeal is separate and distinct from those rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty’ (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; see People v Gonzalez, 138 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2016]). Moreover, although defendant executed a written waiver of appeal, he did not do so in open court, and our review of the record establishes that County Court did not “ensure that defendant understood the content or consequences of the appeal waiver” (People v Williams, 132AD3d 1155, 1155 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1157 [2016]; see People v Lemon, 137 AD3d 1422, 1423 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1135 [2016]).
Notwithstanding, we disagree with defendant’s contention that the aggregate sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty to the crimes at issue with full knowledge of the sentencing range that would be imposed and that the sentences were to run concurrently. He was then sentenced in accordance with that agreement. The first charge involved defendant’s illegal possession of a loaded, stolen handgun and, despite that arrest, while out on bail on those charges, defendant then chose to commit another felony by possessing, among other things, a large quantity of heroin and other drug paraphernalia. While mindful that defendant has no prior criminal history and expressed remorse for his crimes, in light of the seriousness of the offenses committed, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Gunn, 144 AD3d 1193, 1196 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1145 [2017]; People v Smith, 100 AD3d 1144, 1144 [2012]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered May 5, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of conspiracy in the fourth degree.
While defendant was incarcerated in Franklin Correctional Facility in Franklin County, an indictment was returned against him charging him with the crimes of promoting prison contraband in the first degree and conspiracy in the fourth degree for allegedly arranging with an accomplice to smuggle some marihuana and heroin into the facility. Ultimately, defendant entered a counseled Alford plea of guilty to the charge of conspiracy in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2 to 4 years in prison and this appeal ensued.
Initially, defendant argues that County Court erred in accepting his guilty plea in the face of his protestations of innocence during the allocution. We note, however, that due to defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution has not been preserved for appeal (see, People v Gray, 239 AD2d 713, 714, Iv denied 90 NY2d 893). In any event, were we to reach the merits, we would affirm because “it is not necessary that a defendant admit guilt when entering an Alford plea provided the plea is informed and intelligent” (People v White, 214 AD2d 811, 812, Iv denied 86 NY2d 742). Our review of the plea minutes reveals that County Court thoroughly reviewed the ramifications of the plea with defendant who clearly responded that he wished to enter an Alford plea to avoid the risk of trial and the possibility of receiving greater prison exposure if convicted (see, id.). Defendant further indicated that he was acting freely and voluntarily after a complete discussion of the matter with his counsel. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to vacate the plea in the interest of justice.
With respect to defendant’s sentence, we further reject defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive. No promise of a more lenient sentence was made and, given defendant’s criminal history and County Court’s considerable discretion, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J), rendered May 2, 2008, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment alleging that he possessed 10 grams of marihuana while incarcerated, defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree and waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon prison sentence of IV2 to 3 years, to run consecutively to the prison term defendant was already serving. Defendant now appeals and we reverse.
As the People concede, the indictment is jurisdictionally defective insofar as it charges defendant with promoting prison contraband in the first degree, as the 10 grams of marihuana he allegedly possessed did not satisfy the “dangerous contraband” element of that offense (Penal Law § 205.25 [2]; see People v Finley, 10 NY3d 647, 653-659 [2008]; People v Reeves, 78 AD3d 1332,1333 [2010]; People v McCrae, 68 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2009]). Should the People continue to seek the dismissal of the remainder of the indictment, they are free to move for that relief before County Court (see CPL 210.20 [1] [i]; 470.55 [2]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Bruhn, J.), rendered September 26, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea is not preserved for our review insofar as he failed to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Rivera, 20 AD3d 763, 764 [2005]; People v Cash, 19 AD3d 934, 935 [2005]). Moreover, the exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not offer any statements during the plea allocution which cast doubt upon his guilt or otherwise tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Bethea, 19 AD3d 813, 814 [2005]; People v Guishard, 15 AD3d 731, 732 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 789 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 9, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an unindicted charge. His guilty plea included a waiver of the right to appeal. In consideration of his guilty plea, County Court agreed to sentence defendant to a determinate sentence of not more than five years in prison, with a two-year period of postrelease supervision, and also agreed not to sentence defendant as a persistent felony offender. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of five years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, except insofar as the argument relates to the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Belle, 74 AD3d 1477, 1480 [2010]; People v Leigh, 71 AD3d 1288, 1288 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 775 [2010]). To that extent, the issue is unpreserved for our review in light of defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]; People v Glynn, 73 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2010]). Moreover, reversal in the interest of justice is unwarranted inasmuch as the record reflects that defense counsel negotiated a favorable plea agreement and defendant had an opportunity to discuss the terms of the agreement with counsel and stated that he was satisfied with counsel’s representation. Finally, defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal precludes his remaining claims that County Court should have granted him judicial diversion to a substance abuse treatment program (see generally People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]) and that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Board, 75 AD3d 833, 834 [2010]).

He was sentenced, as a second felony offender, in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to 10 years in prison followed by five years of post-release supervision, to run concurrently with an unrelated prison term. On appeal, this Court found the sentence to be illegal and, consequently, vacated the sentence and remitted the matter to County Court for resentencing (People v Warren, 74 AD3d 1639 [2010]). Thereafter, defendant withdrew his previous plea and entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 10 years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant’s contention that County Court abused its discretion in not updating defendant’s presentence investigation report prior to sentencing is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not request an updated report or move to vacate resentencing (see People v Cerohe, 75 AD3d 835, 836 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 850 [2010]; People v Sander, 47 AD3d 1012, 1013 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 844 [2008]). In any event, defense counsel specifically requested that the court proceed to sentencing without an updated presentence report, stating that nothing had changed from the time the court initially sentenced defendant on his prior plea — other than defendant’s participation in certain programs that defense counsel placed on the record. Furthermore, upon our review of the record, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s assertion that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive or that extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant a reduction thereof (see People v Dolison, 23 AD3d 844, 845 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]).

Defendant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced as a second felony offender to 8 to 16 years’ imprisonment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered October 10, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of driving while ability impaired by drugs.
In satisfaction of various charges against him, defendant pleaded guilty in October 2011 to the crime of driving while ability impaired by drugs (see Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192 [4]). The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would enter, upon acceptance, into the Judicial Diversion Program and that, if he failed to successfully complete the program, he would be sentenced to a prison term of 2V3 to 7 years. In August 2013, after waiving his right to a hearing and admitting that he had absconded from his treatment program in November 2012 and used an illegal drug, he was terminated from the program (see CPL 216.05 [9]). County Court sentenced defendant, as previously agreed to in the Judicial Diversion Program contract, to 2V3 to 7 years in prison.
Defendant contends that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because, at the time of his plea, County Court failed to explain a direct consequence of his plea— specifically, the “specified period” of time that he was required to participate in “alcohol or substance abuse treatment” as part of the judicial diversion program (CPL 216.05 [5]; see People v Monk, 21 NY3d 27, 32 [2013]; People v Harnett, 16 NY3d 200, 205-206 [2011]). However, inasmuch as the duration of his treatment regimen was not an “immediate, definite or automatic result” of his guilty plea but, rather, was fashioned by the judicial diversion program outside of County Court’s control in response to defendant’s particular treatment needs and his ongoing response to that treatment, it was a collateral consequence of his plea subject to the preservation requirement (People v Donovan, 94 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2012] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 184 [2013], cert denied 574 US —, 135 S Ct 90 [2014]; People v Monk, 21 NY3d at 32; cf. People v Colley, 121 AD3d 523, 524 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1161 [2015]; but cf. People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545-546 [2007]). Here, defendant made no effort before County Court to call into question the voluntariness of his plea or the Judicial Diversion Program contract and said nothing during the plea colloquy that would bring this case within the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see People v Labaff, 127 AD3d 1471, 1471 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 931 [2015]). Notably, defendant did not challenge the voluntariness of his plea until this appeal and after having admitted to failing to comply with the terms of the judicial diversion program (see People v Donovan, 94 AD3d at 1231). Thus, defendant failed to preserve his claim for our review (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 182; People v Disotell, 123 AD3d 1230, 1231-1232 [2014], lv denied 25 NY3d 1162 [2015] ).
With regard to defendant’s challenge to his sentence as excessive, County Court properly distinguished the waiver of the right to appeal from the rights that defendant had automatically forfeited by virtue of his guilty plea, ensured that defendant understood the rights that he was waiving and had defendant execute a detailed written waiver in open court that indicated, among other things, that he had an opportunity to discuss the waiver with counsel. Accordingly, we find that the appeal waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Jackson, 128 AD3d 1279, 1280 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 930 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1430-1431 [2014]), and, given the valid waiver of appeal, defendant is precluded from challenging his negotiated sentence as harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Ceresia Jr., J.), rendered January 16, 1990, convicting defendant upon his pleas of guilty of the crimes of assault in the second degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (five counts), burglary in the third degree, petit larceny and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
At the time of defendant’s sentencing, the terms of imprisonment imposed with respect to his first plea of guilty to the crimes of assault in the second degree, burglary in the third degree, petit larceny and five counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree were made to run concurrently, with the harshest being 5 to 15 years. As to his second plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, he received a 1-to 3-year prison term to be served consecutively to the 5- to 15-year term. This resulted in defendant receiving a total aggregate term of 6 to 18 years. Given that the sentences imposed were within the statutory guidelines and were the sentences agreed upon during the plea proceedings, we reject defendant’s assertion that they were harsh or excessive (see, People v Phelps, 140 AD2d 637, lv denied 72 NY2d 922).

"McCarthy, J.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence of 2V2 years in prison followed by a term of postrelease supervision between IV2 and 3 years. At sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that he was not guilty and that his plea was not knowingly and intelligently made. County Court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to 2V2 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. The decision whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the trial court’s sound discretion, and a hearing is only required when the circumstances present a genuine question about the voluntariness of the plea (see People v Moreno, 86 AD3d 863, 864 [2011]; People v Shurock, 83 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2011]). Here, the record reveals that defendant was fully advised about the consequences of his plea, had the opportunity to discuss the matter with his attorney, understood the repercussions, and voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the commission of the crime. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s application without a hearing based upon his unsubstantiated claims of innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel (see People v Moreno, 86 AD3d at 864-865; People v Herringshaw, 83 AD3d 1133, 1133-1134 [2011]).
Defendant next contends that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender, however, that claim is unpreserved for our review by virtue of his failure to make an objection at sentencing (see People v Califano, 84 AD3d 1504, 1506 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 805 [2011]; People v Berry, 78 AD3d 1226, 1228 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 828 [2011]). In any event, defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender, a predicate felony statement was provided prior to sentencing, he admitted that he was the person convicted, and defense counsel, on defendant’s behalf, declined the opportunity to controvert any aspect of the prior conviction. Under the circumstances, we find substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (3) (see People v Glynn, 72 AD3d 1351, 1352 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 773 [2010]; People v Atkinson, 58 AD3d 943, 944 [2009]).
Defendant cannot be heard to complain that the presentence investigation report was incomplete when this situation was caused by his refusal to be interviewed by the Probation Department (see People v Ali-Rachedi, 34 AD3d 981, 981 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 878 [2007]; People v Rosado, 29 AD3d 430, 431 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 794 [2006]). Finally, defendant’s contention that he was not made aware of the specific term of postrelease supervision imposed is not preserved for our review (see People v Lee, 80 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 832, 833 [2011]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered April 20, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant pleaded guilty to the criminal sale count in November 2004, and he was subsequently sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 41/2 to 9 years in April 2005. In January 2005, following defendant’s conviction, but prior to imposition of his sentence, new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law § 70.70 became effective (see L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]). Defendant now appeals seeking a reduced sentence pursuant to the new sentencing provisions.
“[T]o the extent that defendant’s constitutional challenge to how he was sentenced survived his plea of guilty and the waiver of his right to appeal” (People v Pauly, 21 AD3d 595, 596 [2005]), we find his challenge to be without merit. “While, in the absence of evidence of contrary intent, the general rule is to retroactively apply remedial or ameliorative amendments, explicit legislation setting forth a prospective effective date ‘is sufficient to overcome any presumption of retroactivity’ ” (People v Walker, 26 AD3d 676, 677 [2006], quoting People v Sutton, 199 AD2d 878, 879 [1993]). The Legislature specifically addressed the retroactive application of the new sentencing provisions when it directed “that the new sentencing ranges for class B felony drug offenders under Penal Law § 70.70 ‘shall take effect on the thirtieth day [January 13, 2005] after [the Act] shall have become a law, and . . . shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date thereof ” (People v Walker, supra at 677, quoting L 2004, ch 738, § 41 [d-1]). Here, defendant committed the acts which are the basis for his conviction prior to the effective date of the new sentencing provisions and, therefore, the new provisions were not applicable (see People v Milner, 28 AD3d 873, 874-875 [2006]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered March 4, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Upon entering a plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years. As a part of his guilty plea, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal. Defendant now contends that his waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and that the sentence he received is harsh and excessive.
Defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction; he has therefore failed to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the plea for review (see, People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662; People v Schouenborg, 188 AD2d 625; People v Linares, 174 AD2d 847, lv denied 78 NY2d 969). In any event, the record establishes that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1). Given that defendant was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in satisfaction of a nine-count indictment, pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence imposed, has a prior criminal history and was not given the harshest possible sentence, there is no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976).

"Cardona, P.J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 12, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
On June 1, 2000, defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree stemming from her possession of more than one-half ounce of cocaine on February 17, 2000 in Chemung County. Defendant entered a guilty plea to one count on the day her suppression hearing was scheduled. County Court accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment, as well as an unindicted criminal sale. It was further agreed that defendant would be sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 10 years, upon her adjudication as a second felony offender, to run concurrently with a sentence in another county for a violation of probation. During the plea colloquy, defense counsel withdrew defendant’s suppression motion and informed the court that defendant understood that there would be no further hearings. Defendant acknowledged hearing everything and indicated her desire to enter the guilty plea. She did so and was subsequently sentenced in accordance with the plea bargain.
On appeal, defendant contends that due to defense counsel’s failure to pursue the suppression hearing, she “blindly” entered her guilty plea and, therefore, it was not entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. However, an examination of the record clearly shows that County Court fully explained the consequences of pleading guilty to defendant, including the rights she would be waiving. Defendant indicated that she understood what was transpiring and confirmed that she was not being coerced into entering the plea. Furthermore, she acknowledged that she was doing so based only upon the promises encompassed within the plea bargain. In response to County Court’s inquiry concerning her conduct on the date of the crimes, she responded that she possessed 168 fifty-dollar bags of what she knew or believed to be cocaine, having an aggregate weight of more than one-half ounce. Under the circumstances, we find the failure to hold the suppression hearing “had no impact upon the knowing and voluntary nature of defendant’s plea” (People v Clifford, 295 AD2d 697, 698, lv denied 98 NY2d 709) and conclude that the plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see People v Whitesell, 299 AD2d 654; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813).
Additionally, we note that by pleading guilty before she obtained a final order denying her motion to suppress, defendant forfeited her right to appellate review of the sufficiency of the search warrant application under the statutory exception provided in CPL 710.70 (2) (see People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 86-87, lv denied 98 NY2d 642; People v Sides, 242 AD2d 750, 750-751, lv denied 91 NY2d 836).
Next, defendant argues that her sentence was harsh and excessive and that extraordinary circumstances, consisting of a dysfunctional family environment, alcohol and drug addictions and a history of nonviolent crimes, warrant a reduction of her sentence in the interest of justice. We disagree. Defendant’s sentence was well within the statutory parameters for a class B felony (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]; § 220.16 [12]). We note that defendant’s background and family circumstances were contained in the presentence investigation report submitted to County Court (see People v Baker, 253 AD2d 943; People v Kalakowski, 120 AD2d 763, lv denied 68 NY2d 669). We also take into consideration defendant’s failure to effectively deal with her addictions despite the availability of services. Under the circumstances, including defendant’s recidivism, we find that the sentence was not harsh or excessive.
Finally, while we are not unsympathetic to defendant’s personal circumstances, we do not find them to be “extraordi nary” and, therefore, a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice is not warranted (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered December 9, 1999, which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant entered a plea of guilty of the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and, in February 1999, County Court sentenced him to six months in jail, with credit for time served, and a five-year period of probation. Less than three months later, defendant was arrested in New York City on a drug sale charge and, in June 1999, he entered a plea of guilty of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, on which a prison sentence of 3 to 6 years was imposed. The plea also apparently encompassed another drug sale charge that had been pending since May 1998 and predated defendant’s initial arrest in Sullivan County. Defendant received a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years on that earlier charge. Based on the conviction arising out of conduct committed while on probation, defendant was found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. County Court revoked defendant’s probation and sentenced him to the maximum possible prison term of 5 to 15 years to run consecutively to the sentences imposed upon the other convictions. Defendant appeals, claiming that the sentence is harsh and excessive.
In light of defendant’s three drug-related convictions for conduct committed over a period of less than one year, with the most recent drug sale occurring less than three months after County Court had placed him on probation, a lengthy sentence was warranted and we see no abuse of discretion in County Court’s imposition of the maximum possible term of 5 to 15 years. While imposition of the maximum prison term can be justified by the record, the added effect of consecutive sentencing strikes us as excessive. Defendant does not have an extensive criminal record over a lengthy period and there is no evidence that his involvement in the drug-related activity was anything other than recent and short term. Nor does the record reveal anything in the nature of the crimes that would warrant the added effect of consecutive sentencing. There is no indication of violence or the presence of weapons and there is nothing to suggest that defendant’s involvement in the sale of drugs was anything other than the lowest level. Based upon the record, we conclude that the consecutive nature of the sentence is unduly severe and, therefore, the judgment should be modified (see, People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908; People v Sturgis, 202 AD2d 808, 810, lv denied 84 NY2d 833).
Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by directing that the prison sentence imposed on defendant be served concurrently with any sentence previously imposed by any other court rather than consecutively, and, as so modified, affirmed.
Although the Sullivan County indictment satisfied by his plea included a count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, the People candidly admitted at the original sentencing that dismissal of that count was required because of the lack of proof that defendant had any knowledge of the weight of the drugs found in the vehicle in which he was riding.",,587,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Greene County (Fromer, J.), rendered August 8, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree.
As a condition of defendant’s plea bargain, defendant was to be sentenced to lifetime probation if he cooperated with the State Police in a continuing drug investigation. When he failed to do so, defendant was sentenced to five years to life in prison. Defendant now contends that because the terms of the agreement were impossible to perform, as he was not in the position to participate at the level of drug involvement that was required, his sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced. At the time of his plea, defendant was not only represented by competent counsel who had the District Attorney explain how defendant was to cooperate, but defendant himself appeared to be fully aware of the level of participation required of him. In addition, defendant derived a benefit from pleading guilty as he was able to plead to an A-II felony instead of an A-I felony, which carried with it a more lenient sentence (compare, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i], with Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [ii]). Under these circumstances, coupled with the fact that defendant did not receive the harshest sentence possible, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence (see, People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305; People v Du Bray, 76 AD2d 976, 977).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered March 4, 1991, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant’s contentions that his sentence, imposed after acceptance of his bargained plea of guilty to a single count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of an indictment charging three separate class B felony offenses, was harsh and excessive and that County Court abused its discretion in imposing a surcharge of $152 under Penal Law § 60.35 (1) (a) are without merit.
Defendant was sentenced to a term of 3 to 9 years’ imprisonment in the face of a possible prison sentence of 8 Vs to 25 years which could have been imposed on the charge to which he pleaded guilty.

Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. Although defense counsel and the People offered a joint recommendation that defendant be sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison, County Court ultimately imposed a prison term of 6 to 18 years.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Ledina, J.), rendered July 15, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of three counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
On April 10, 1996 and May 1, 1996, defendant was charged in three separate indictments with a total of four counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Thereafter, on May 28, 1996, defendant was arraigned and counsel was assigned to represent him. Defense counsel filed two motions and eventually, on June 4, 1996, the People filed their notice of readiness for trial. On July 8, 1997, defendant entered pleas of guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the remaining counts. As a result, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of six years to life. Defendant now appeals contending that his constitutional right to a speedy trial (see, CPL 30.20) was violated.
We begin by acknowledging that the constitutional right to a speedy trial may, indeed, be surrendered (see, People v Rodriguez, 50 NY2d 553, 557). Since, as defendant readily concedes, prior to the entry of his guilty pleas he made no motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground of denial of the right to a speedy trial, defendant has waived this claim (see, People v Lawrence, 64 NY2d 200, 203-204; People v Jordan, 62 NY2d 825, 826; People v Gates, 238 AD2d 729, 731, lv denied 90 NY2d 905; see also, CPL 210.20 [1] [g]; [2]; 210.45 [1]).

Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Crew, III, J.), rendered November 7, 1986 in Tioga County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony; he allegedly sold 0.75 grams of cocaine to a police informant. During his trial on that charge, defendant, on the advice of counsel, pleaded guilty to a class D felony and received a bargained-for sentence of 2 to 4 years’ incarceration. Following his plea, defendant, pursuant to CPL 400.21, challenged the validity of his prior felony conviction in Pennsylvania, claiming that he thought he was pleading guilty to a misdemeanor or had the opportunity to convert the felony to a misdemeanor by testifying on behalf of the prosecution. Supreme Court held a hearing and determined that defendant was well aware he was pleading guilty to a felony. At sentencing, defendant complained about the effectiveness of his trial counsel. He was given the opportunity to consult with a different lawyer, following which he declined to withdraw his guilty plea. The agreed-upon sentence was then imposed. Defendant appeals, relying primarily on the grounds raised at Supreme Court. We affirm.
A knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea generally waives nonjurisdictional defenses (People v Taylor, 65 NY2d 1, 5), such as a claim of ineffective trial counsel (see, People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535). Defendant seeks to bootstrap that claim by arguing that he was ""railroaded” into pleading guilty because of his attorney’s poor trial performance and, therefore, his plea was involuntary. The record reveals that the motivating factor for his plea was the strength of the People’s case, not any inadequacy on the part of defense counsel (see, People v Bonk, 83 AD2d 695). His belief that a promising defense existed is not supported by the record. That defendant’s counsel was indeed effective is apparent from the fact that although defendant faced a possible prison term of 12V2 to 25 years if convicted of the indicted charge, counsel secured a plea to a less severe felony and the minimum sentence available.
Given defendant’s acknowledgement during the Pennsylvania plea allocution that the offenses to which he was pleading guilty were all felonies, his challenge to his status as a predicate felon lacks merit. And defendant’s remaining contentions, including the assertion that the negotiated sentence was harsh and excessive, are either unpersuasive or have been waived by his guilty plea (see, e.g., People v Clavijo, 126 AD2d 907, 908; People v Normandin, 122 AD2d 348, 349-350).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered October 10, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree following an incident in which police recovered cocaine, as well as other drugs and related items, from a hotel room where he was staying. Defense counsel moved to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of the search of the hotel room. There were a number of adjournments of the suppression hearing and, before it was conducted, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. Consistent with the plea agreement, he was sentenced to two years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. He now appeals.
Defendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney’s failure to proceed with the suppression hearing prior to defendant’s entry of a guilty plea. To the extent that this claim has a bearing upon the voluntariness of defendant’s plea, we find that it is unpreserved due to defendant’s failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Smith, 119 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2014]; People v Flake, 95 AD3d 1371, 1372 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012]; People v Stevenson, 58 AD3d 948, 949 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 860 [2009]). As for defendant’s claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive, we find it to be unpersuasive. Defendant could have received a determinate sentence of anywhere from one to nine years in prison for the crime to which he pleaded guilty (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [i]). He received two years in prison instead and this was the sentence agreed to under the terms of the plea agreement. Therefore, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lawal, 73 AD3d 1287, 1290 [2010]; People v Muniz, 12 AD3d 937, 939 [2004]).

"Appeal by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Suffolk County (Rohl, J.), the first rendered January 22, 1985, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 546/84, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence as a persistent felony offender to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life imprisonment, and the second rendered February 21, 1985, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 547/84, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence of an indeterminate term of 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment.
Ordered that the judgment under indictment No. 546/84 is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the sentence to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life imprisonment. As so modified, that judgment is affirmed; and it is further,
Ordered that the judgment under indictment No. 547/84 is affirmed.
Viewed in a light most favorable to the People (see, People v Bauer, 113 AD2d 543, 548), the evidence adduced at the jury trial demonstrates that on November 3, 1983, the defendant sold heroin to a police officer while the latter was acting as an undercover agent. We therefore find a sufficient basis in the record to sustain the conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.39 [1]) under indictment No. 546/84. However, we find the sentence imposed on this conviction excessive to the extent indicated.
The defendant’s remaining contention that the court erroneously denied the request to charge the jury with respect to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree is without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Koweek, J.), rendered January 15, 2014, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree as charged in a superior court information. Under the terms of the plea agreement, County Court was to sentence defendant, in accordance with a joint recommendation, to three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision, provided that he appeared for sentencing. Defendant, however, fled to Florida where he was convicted of additional drug-related crimes. He was extradited to New York and, when he appeared for sentencing, he was sentenced to 4V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was fully informed of the consequences of failing to appear at sentencing at the time that he entered his guilty plea, but chose to travel to Florida where he remained for a substantial period of time and committed further crimes before being extradited to New York. In view of this, we find no abuse of discretion nor any extraordinary consequences warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Rencher, 65 AD3d 1389, 1390 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 910 [2009]; see also People v Johnson, 20 AD3d 591, 592 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 807 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered March 13, 2014, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of grand larceny in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In 2013, defendant was charged in an indictment with two counts of grand larceny in the third degree related to her receipt of unemployment benefits to which she was not entitled. Subsequently, a second indictment stemming from a separate incident charged her with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. In full satisfaction of both indictments, defendant plead guilty to one count of grand larceny in the third degree and one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived her right to appeal. She was then sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 1 to 3 years on the grand larceny count and three years on the criminal sale of a controlled substance count, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision (hereinafter PRS). Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant failed to preserve her argument that she was not arraigned on the charges of grand larceny in the third degree, in violation of CPL 180.10 (see People v Hallenbeck, 81 AD3d 1077, 1078 [2011]). To the extent that this argument implicates County Court’s jurisdiction, defendant consented to such jurisdiction through her subsequent appearance and entry of a plea (see People v Miller, 27 AD3d 1017, 1018 [2006]; People v Golston, 13 AD3d 887, 889 [2004], lv denied 5 NY3d 789 [2005]; People v Roberts, 6 AD3d 942, 943 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 662 [2004]).
Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations in the indictments is similarly unpreserved for our review and waived by her guilty plea (see People v Cruz, 104 AD3d 1022, 1024 [2013]; People v Brown, 75 AD3d 655, 656 [2010]). In any event, the indictments, as amplified by the People’s responses to County Court’s discovery orders, provided defendant with “sufficient notice of the accusations against [her] to enable [her] to prepare a defense” (People v Perez, 93 AD3d 1032, 1035 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1000 [2012]).
Finally, the record belies defendant’s argument that she was not adequately apprised that her sentence would include a period of PRS. Defendant was informed during the plea proceedings that, in exchange for her plea, she would receive a sentencing recommendation that would include, as is relevant here, two years of PRS. County Court further advised her that if she accepted the plea, she faced a maximum possible prison sentence of nine years that would include two years of PRS. Defendant failed to object to the imposition of PRS, either during the plea proceedings in January 2014 or at her subsequent sentencing in March 2014, nor did she move to withdraw her plea by a postallocution motion. Thus, as defendant had knowledge of the PRS component of her plea and an “ample opportunity to raise an objection” prior to the imposition of the sentence, her failure to do so renders her contention unpreserved for our review (People v Crowder, 24 NY3d 1134, 1136-1137 [2015]; see People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]; People v Medina, 129 AD3d 1385, 1386 [2015]).

"Egan Jr., J.
Defendant was charged in two separate indictments with vari ous drug-related offenses and, in connection therewith, applied for participation in the judicial diversion program (see CPL art 216). After considering the submissions tendered by defendant and the People, County Court denied defendant’s application. Thereafter, in full satisfaction of both indictments, as well as a probation violation, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and, further, admitted violating the terms of his probation. Defendant then was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon aggregate prison term of 44/2 years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Defendant’s sole argument upon appeal is that County Court abused its discretion in denying his application for participation in the judicial diversion program. To the extent that defendant did not abandon this issue by failing to request a hearing in this regard (see CPL 216.05 [3] [a]), we nonetheless find defendant’s argument to be lacking in merit. “Courts are afforded great deference in making judicial diversion determinations” (People v Williams, 105 AD3d 1428, 1428 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1021 [2013] [citations omitted]; see People v Buswell, 88 AD3d 1164, 1165 [2011]; see also Matter of Carty v Hall, 92 AD3d 1191, 1192 [2012]). Inasmuch as the record before us reflects that County Court denied defendant’s application based upon his extensive criminal history and threat to public safety, we discern no abuse of discretion here (see People v Williams, 105 AD3d at 1428). Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Nichols, J.), rendered September 25, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted assault in the first degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to a two-count indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, as well as a superior court information charging him with attempted assault in the first degree. Under the terms of the plea bargain, the prosecution and defense counsel agreed to a joint sentencing recommendation providing that defendant would be sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 10 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. In addition, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court deviated from the joint sentencing recommendation and sentenced defendant as a predicate felony offender to an aggregate prison term of 18 years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we note that although defendant waived his right to appeal as part of the plea bargain, the People concede that the waiver included an exception that would permit review of the claims now advanced before us. Specifically, the written waiver provided, as relevant here, that defendant has “the right to appeal the sentence to be imposed should it be harsher than the sentence the District Attorney and I negotiated and jointly recommended.” Inasmuch as defendant’s arguments implicate only the exception to his waiver of the right to appeal, we address the substance of defendant’s claims.
Preliminarily, we note that defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is unpreserved for our review given his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Johnson, 54 AD3d 1133, 1134 [2008]; People v Farrington, 51 AD3d 1221, 1222 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 736 [2008]). Nevertheless, even if we were to consider it, we would find it to be without merit. Defendant’s claim that his attorney failed to adequately investigate his mental health history concerns matters outside the record and is more properly the subject of a CPL article 440 motion (see People v Dobrouch, 59 AD3d 781, 781 [2009]; People v Sterling, 57 AD3d 1110, 1113 [2008]). Moreover, the record belies defendant’s assertion that his counsel failed to zealously advocate for imposition of the joint sentencing recommendation as it discloses that defense counsel made a cogent argument to County Court, but that the court chose to impose a greater sentence due to defendant’s failure to accept responsibility for his actions. Under these circumstances, we do not find that defendant was denied meaningful representation (see People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).
Likewise, we find no merit to defendant’s claim that his sentence is harsh and excessive. County Court was not bound to follow the joint sentencing recommendation (see People v Mills, 17 AD3d 712, 713 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 766 [2005]), and the court made defendant aware of this fact during the plea proceedings, also informing him of the maximum potential prison exposure. Notably, the presentence investigation report discloses that defendant has a lengthy criminal record and that he blamed the incident in which he tried to assault his wife on others’ interference in their relationship. Under these circumstances, we do not find that there exists either an abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Carter, 40 AD3d 1211, 1213 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 864 [2007]; People v Sieber, 26 AD3d 535, 536 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 853 [2006]).

As a part of her plea of guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, defendant agreed to waive her right to appeal. She now contends that the waiver of her right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary and that the prison sentence she received was harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw her plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, she has failed to preserve her challenge to the sufficiency of the plea for review. Nevertheless, were we to consider the merits, our review of the record discloses that the plea was knowing and voluntary. Lastly, we reject defendant’s claim that her sentence was harsh and excessive given that she was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, which was within statutory parameters, and had a prior criminal record of drug-related offenses.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Harrigan, J.), rendered October 30, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Upon pleading guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years to life. Defendant’s only contention on appeal is that his prison sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced because he has no prior convictions and his codefendant’s sentence is more lenient. First, not only is there no requirement that the sentencing court give each codefendant the same sentence (see, People v Powers, 173 AD2d 886, 890), but here a more lenient sentence was warranted as the codefendant pleaded guilty to three class B felonies while defendant pleaded guilty to a class A-II felony. In addition, in exchange for defendant’s plea of guilty, one count of the indictment was dismissed and the District Attorney agreed to recommend the prison sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that defendant’s sentence, which was less than the harshest authorized by statute (Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [ii]), is harsh and excessive (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899; People v Neira, 130 AD2d 518, lv denied 70 NY2d 715).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton Court (McGill, J.), rendered January 15, 2009, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was thereafter sentenced to a term of three years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s claims that his plea was not entered knowingly, voluntarily or intelligently and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are not preserved for our review due to his failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]; People v Dantzler, 63 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 799 [2010]). Moreover, with regard to the plea, the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that cast doubt on his guilt or tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Scitz, 67 AD3d 1251, 1251 [2009]). In any event, defendant’s claims are without merit, as the record reveals that County Court fully apprised defendant of the ramifications of pleading guilty and defendant communicated his understanding on the record, relinquished his rights and freely admitted his guilt (see People v Swarts, 64 AD3d 801, 802 [2009]). Further, contrary to defendant’s contention, it was not necessary that defendant recite the facts underlying his crime (see People v Smith, 57 AD3d 1237, 1237 [2008]).
As to defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, his claims that counsel failed to meet with him, make certain pretrial motions, investigate certain defenses and pressured him into pleading guilty concern matters outside the record and are not properly the subject of a direct appeal (see People v Carroll, 299 AD2d 572, 572-573 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 626 [2003]). Finally, as the record reflects that defendant did not validly waive his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]), we have considered defendant’s challenge to the severity of his agreed-upon prison sentence and find neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the interest of justice (see People v Parsons, 65 AD3d 716, 716 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 838 [2009]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 11, 2011, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In connection with the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and County Court committed to a prison sentence of no more than eight years followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant failed to appear for the initial sentencing date, prompting County Court to issue a bench warrant for his arrest. Upon defendant’s appearance at the next scheduled date, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Although defendant’s claim that his plea was involuntary survives his waiver of the right to appeal, the record before us does not reflect that defendant preserved this argument for our review by making a motion to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Musser, 106 AD3d 1334, 1335 [2013]; People v Richardson, 83 AD3d 1290, 1291 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 821 [2011]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d 1384, 1384-1385 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 809 [2010]). Nor does the record reveal any basis upon which the exception to the preservation requirement would be triggered, as nothing in the minutes of the plea proceeding casts doubt upon defendant’s guilt or the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1109 [2012]; People v Planty, 85 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2011] , lv denied 17 NY3d 820 [2011]; People v Board, 75 AD3d 833, 833 [2010]). To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument relates to the voluntariness of his plea, it also survives his waiver of the right to appeal, but is likewise unpreserved (see People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012] , lv denied 20 NY3d 1105 [2013]; People v Benson, 100 AD3d at 1109; People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385). Finally, defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is foreclosed by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 97 AD3d 853, 853-854 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1027 [2012]; People v Singh, 73 AD3d at 1385).

Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. We disagree.

In view of this, and given defendant’s criminal history and involvement in bringing large quantities of narcotic drugs into Washington County from New York City, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Aubrey, 73 AD3d 1393, 1394 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 893 [2011]; People v Murray, 58 AD3d 1073, 1076 [2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 786 [2009]; People v Martin, 52 AD3d 943 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 791 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered September 14, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the third degree.
Resolving a seven-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of marihuana in the third degree and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the third degree. County Court sentenced defendant to five years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision for criminal possession of a controlled substance, IV2 years in prison and two years of postrelease supervision for criminal possession of marihuana, and 30 days incarceration for aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, with all sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Hernandez, 21 AD3d 1214, 1215 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 883 [2005]; People v Daniels, 16 AD3d 780, 780 [2005]). The sentences, all within the permissible statutory ranges, are not harsh or excessive under the circumstances. With respect to defendant’s allegation that a portion of his sentence is illegal, the People concede, and we agree, that the period of postrelease supervision relative to defendant’s conviction for criminal possession of marihuana, a class E felony (see Penal Law § 221.20), should have been only one year (see Penal Law § 70.45 [2] [a]).

Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment and an uncharged crime. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to the agreed-upon term of imprisonment of four years, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision.

In any event, a review of the plea proceedings revealed that although defendant was at first equivocal regarding whether or not he wanted to accept the plea agreement, after County Court repeatedly permitted him time to consult with his attorney, he knowingly and voluntarily accepted the plea agreement (see People v Barrier, 7 AD3d 885, 885 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 670 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Leaman, J.), rendered March 8, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of attempted murder in the second degree, criminal use of a weapon in the first degree (two counts), reckless endangerment in the first degree and assault in the first degree.
On March 7, 1994, defendant was convicted, following trial, of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced to a term of 6 to 20 years’ imprisonment. The next day, defendant agreed to a plea bargain relating to five unrelated pending charges set forth in a separate indictment. Pursuant to the terms of the plea bargain, defendant would plead guilty to the five charges set forth in the second indictment in exchange for which the sentences imposed would run concurrently with the prison term imposed upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was accordingly sentenced upon his guilty pleas to prison terms of 81/3 to 25 years for second degree attempted murder, 81/3 to 25 years for each of the two counts of first degree criminal use of a weapon, 21h to 7 years for first degree reckless endangerment and 5 to 15 years for first degree assault. All five sentences were to run concurrently with each other and with the sentence imposed on defendant’s previous conviction.
This Court subsequently reversed the judgment convicting defendant of third degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, remitting the matter for a new trial on the ground that defendant had been deprived of a fair trial by certain evidentiary rulings made by County Court (see, People v Walker, 217 AD2d 856). Defendant contends in the context of the instant appeal that the judgment convicting him upon his guilty pleas must also be reversed on the ground that he was induced to plead guilty by the prosecution’s promise that the resulting sentences would run concurrently with the sentence imposed for his prior conviction, a conviction which has since been reversed by this Court.
Our review of the record, however, indicates that defendant’s guilty pleas to the charges in the second indictment were not related to his prior conviction with the exception of the plea bargain agreement that the prison terms resulting therefrom would run concurrently. It is evident that defendant’s guilty pleas were voluntary, uncoerced, and knowingly and intelligently made; that he was represented by competent counsel throughout the proceedings; and that the prosecution abided by its promise regarding the concurrency of the sentences imposed. We can find no justification for enabling defendant to profit from the reversal of one judgment of conviction by reversing a subsequent judgment based on unrelated charges (see, People v Lbwrance, 41 NY2d 303, 304; cf., People v Clark, 45 NY2d 432, 440). We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered October 28, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of an eight-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He thereafter moved to withdraw his plea on the basis that it was not voluntarily entered. Specifically, defendant claimed that he was not provided sufficient opportunity to review discovery materials prior to deciding whether to plead guilty or go forward with pretrial suppression hearings and face revocation of the plea offer by the People. County Court denied defendant’s motion and sentenced him in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to 4V2 to 9 years in prison. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Initially, contrary to the People’s assertion, defendant’s argument does concern the voluntariness of his plea and, as such, survives defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal. Moreover, the issue has been preserved for our review by defendant’s motion to withdraw the plea (see People v Murray, 25 AD3d 911, 912 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 896 [2006]; People v Batcher, 291 AD2d 581, 582 [2002]).
Turning to the merits, the plea minutes reveal that defendant, by his own assertions, had adequate time to consult with his attorney and was satisfied with his services, fully understood his rights and agreed to give them up and was not threatened or promised anything in exchange for his plea. Defendant then freely admitted the facts underlying the crime and pleaded guilty. Under these circumstances, County Court providently exercised its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea on the ground that it was voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Morris, 30 AD3d 632, 632 [2006]; People v Kagonyera, 23 AD3d 840, 841 [2005]).

In September 2009, defendant was arrested for selling over two ounces of cocaine to an undercover police operative. Thereafter, in satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to a term of eight years, followed by five years of postrelease supervision. This appeal followed.
We affirm. Initially, in light of defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, his claims that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel are not preserved for our review (see People v Henry, 73 AD3d 1391, 1392 [2010]; People v Gomez, 72 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2010]; People v Gorrell, 63 AD3d 1381, 1381 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 744 [2009]). Further, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is not applicable herein as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that raised any doubt as to his guilt or tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Gantt, 84 AD3d 1642, 1643 [2011]). Although defendant did state that he had taken some prescription antidepressant medication prior to the plea, upon questioning by the court, defendant denied that this impaired his ability to understand the proceedings (see People v Amidon, 79 AD3d 1158, 1159 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 741 [2011]; People v Lafoe, 75 AD3d 663, 663-664 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 953 [2010]). Defendant’s further claim that County Court failed to uphold an alleged promise to consider possible drug programs or alternative sentencing is not supported by the record (see People v Chaney, 70 AD3d 1251, 1252 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 748 [2010]).
We reject defendant’s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive. Defendant’s determinate sentence was the minimum available upon his conviction of the A-l felony of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (see Penal Law § 70.71 [2] [b] [i]; § 220.43), and thus this claim lacks merit (see People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered September 12, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He thereafter was sentenced as a prior felony offender to nine years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that he was illegally sentenced as a prior felony offender due to County Court’s failure to advise him of the right to challenge the allegations in the predicate felony statement, including the right to challenge the constitutional basis for the prior conviction. Contrary to defendant’s contention, however, “County Court was not obligated to expressly advise defendant of his right to contest the constitutionality of the prior conviction” (People v Smith, 121 AD2d 771, 772 [1986] [citations omitted]; accord People v Wood, 108 AD3d 932, 932-933 [2013]). Moreover, the record reflects that, upon being questioned by County Court at sentencing, defense counsel admitted the prior conviction on defendant’s behalf and informed the court that defendant did not contest the allegations in the prior felony statement. Further, when questioned directly by County Court, defendant admitted the prior conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. Accordingly, we conclude that the statutory requirements of CPL 400.21 (3) were substantially complied with, and County Court properly sentenced defendant as a prior felony offender (see People v Wood, 108 AD3d at 933).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (Aison, J.), rendered February 20, 1992, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
In 1990, defendant was convicted following a jury trial of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 121/2 to 25 years on the possession of a controlled substance conviction and 31/2 to 7 years on the weapons conviction. Upon appeal, this Court determined that defendant was improperly sentenced as a predicate felon and remitted the matter for resentencing (176 AD2d 1007, lv denied 79 NY2d 824). Thereafter, defendant made a CPL 330.30 motion seeking to set aside the verdict on speedy trial grounds, an issue previously determined adversely to defendant both by County Court following a pretrial hearing and by this Court on defendant’s original appeal (ibid.). County Court denied this motion and resentenced defendant to consecutive prison terms of 81/s to 25 years on the possession of a controlled substance conviction and 21/3 to 7 years on the weapons conviction. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive. Contrary to defendant’s claims, the record does not support his assertion that County Court imposed this particular sentence out of vindictiveness because his original sentence was reversed on appeal. Although it is true that the new sentence has a greater cumulative maximum term, it is also true that the minimum aggregate sentence is less than the original sentence. In any event, even if the new sentence is technically a more severe one, this is not a situation where a harsher sentence was imposed after a new trial (see, e.g., People v Van Pelt, 76 NY2d 156) and County Court adequately explained its reasons for the sentence imposed.
Turning to defendant’s renewed claim that he was denied his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial, we note that we previously considered and rejected this contention (see, 176 AD2d 1007, supra). Although defendant maintains that County Court erred in denying his CPL 330.30 motion without a hearing, County Court held that defendant’s motion was both meritless and untimely because it was not made prior to defendant’s original sentence. We do not need to determine the timeliness issue because we agree that defendant’s motion was properly denied on the merits. In our view, the evidence defendant sought to introduce at a new hearing could have been produced at the earlier hearing in the exercise of ""due diligence” (CPL 330.30 [3]; see, People v Wilson, 168 AD2d 696, 699) and was not of the character that would clearly indicate that reversal was required (CPL 330.30 [1]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered September 13, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the third degree.
While under indictment for grand larceny in the fourth degree and under investigation for a widespread check fraud scheme, defendant was arrested and indicted on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and third degrees. A plea agreement was reached whereby defendant would plead guilty to a reduced drug charge, to the pending grand larceny charge and to another undetermined charge in satisfaction of the pending investigation. In exchange, he would receive concurrent sentences of eight years to life on the drug conviction, 1½ to 3 years on the grand larceny conviction and 3½ to 7 years on the undetermined charge. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and grand larceny in the fourth degree. He was subsequently charged with grand larceny in the third degree stemming from the pending investigation, waived indictment and entered a guilty plea to that charge as well. Although the absence of the Special Prosecutor prevented County Court from sentencing defendant for the crime of grand larceny in the fourth degree, it proceeded to sentence him on the other two charges in accordance with the plea agreement and ordered him to pay over $92,000 in restitution. Defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction on these two charges.
Initially, defendant contends that the two-count drug indictment should have been dismissed as defective because it was based upon uncorroborated accomplice testimony before the grand jury. However, a review of the record reveals that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea to a reduced charge in satisfaction of this indictment and, thus, waived this challenge (see People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 233 [2000]; People v Whitehurst, 291 AD2d 83, 87-88 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 642 [2002]; People v Robertson, 279 AD2d 711, 712 [2001], lv denied 96 NY2d 805 [2001]). Defendant similarly waived his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on counsel’s failure to challenge the indictment or make other pretrial motions since he does not claim, and there is nothing to suggest, that these alleged failures undermined the voluntariness of his pleas (see People v Porter, 300 AD2d 698, 699 [2002], lv denied 100 NY2d 541 [2003]; People v Lynch, 256 AD2d 651 [1998], lv denied 93 NY2d 1004 [1999]; People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, 793 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 982 [1996]).
Defendant also contends that the report of the presentence investigation should be physically redacted to remove allegedly unreliable information, most notably a hearsay reference to his having threatened a 14-year-old accomplice to the drug charges. Defendant challenged this and other elements of the presentence report during the sentencing proceeding and County Court agreed not to consider same in its sentencing determination. Although defendant was thus not aggrieved, particularly since he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, he now seeks to have the report redacted to avoid future prejudice in parole and other discretionary determinations.
The purpose of a presentence investigation “is to provide the court with the best available information upon which to render an individualized sentence” (People v Perry, 36 NY2d 114, 120 [1975]). To that end, presentence reports should include “all information that may have a bearing upon” the court’s sentencing determination (9 NYCRR 350.6; see GPL 390.30; see also People v Whalen, 99 AD2d 883, 884 [1984]), even if such information does not meet the technical rules for admissibility at trial (see People v Perry, supra at 120). Here, defendant was properly afforded an opportunity to challenge the contents of the presentence report (see e.g. People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713 [1993]; People v Perry, supra at 119) and while County Court, in its discretion, opted not to rely on the challenged information in its deliberations, we see no basis for physical redaction of the report.
Lastly, defendant seeks modification of his sentence on the drug conviction, contending that if his sentence were reduced to three years to life he would be able to begin restitution payments sooner. We are unimpressed with this contention. Alternatively, he argues that his sentence on the drug count was so disproportionate to the seriousness of his crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. We disagree. In our view, defendant’s sentence on the drug conviction was not so grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct as to render the sentence unconstitutional (see People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 117 [1975], cert denied 423 US 950 [1975]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Monroe, J.), rendered March 30, 1984, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree.
Defendant claims on this appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on his Sandoval motion. That motion was made orally by defendant subsequent to the jury selection and prior to opening statements. The record reveals that defendant had been convicted of two illegal sales of alcoholic beverages in 1972, and that in the same year defendant was arrested in California on three separate occasions. The court ruled that questioning of these events on cross-examination would be impermissible if defendant testified on his own behalf. A 1973 conviction of obstruction of governmental administration was also ruled inadmissible and the prosecution agreed not to cross-examine concerning it. The prosecution further agreed not to cross-examine concerning a 1974 conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance because of the similarity of that conviction to the crime charged, and agreed not to cross-examine about defendant’s arrest for the crime of menacing in 1983. The court also ruled a 1978 conviction of disorderly conduct inadmissible.
By further ruling, the trial court permitted a 1975 conviction of possession of a forged instrument, 1975 convictions of burglary in the third degree and petit larceny, and a 1983 conviction of resisting arrest to be utilized on cross-examination if defendant elected to testify. Defendant did so testify on his own behalf, so our review is limited to the prejudicial effect that the prosecutor’s permitted cross-examination about the unrelated crimes might have had on the minds of the jury.
In the circumstances, we find the discretion of the trial court to have been carefully and properly exercised, especially since the jury was cautioned that the convictions were to be considered only on the issue of defendant’s credibility. Contrary to defendant’s contention, we do not find the 1975 convictions so remote as to require their suppression.
Upon conviction, defendant received an indeterminate prison sentence of 2 to 4 years. Additionally, the trial court imposed a mandatory surcharge of $75 under Penal Law § 60.35. The imposition of this surcharge was mandatory and constitutional (People v Dodson, 96 AD2d 1116, 1118). The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered November 29, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced to a prison term of V-js to 4 years. On appeal, defendant argues that his sentence was harsh and excessive and requests that this Court reduce it in the interest of justice. Given defendant’s favorable plea bargain which included a sentence within the statutory parameters and the fact that a pending assault charge was merged into the plea, we find defendant’s argument to be unpersuasive (see, People v Sullivan, 215 AD2d 850; People v Snell, 207 AD2d 925). Accordingly, we decline to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Harris, J.), rendered January 6, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
On April 6, 1988, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to a reduced count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in full satisfaction of an indictment which charged that crime in its third degree and other lesser drug-related offenses. The plea arose out of defendant’s sale of cocaine to an undercover informant at defendant’s home on July 14, 1986. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to six months’ incarceration and five years’ probation.
On this appeal, defendant complains of the ineffective assistance of his attorney due to the attorney’s failure to make certain pretrial motions. We find this contention meritless in view of the attorney’s experience, the overwhelming proof of defendant’s guilt and the favorable plea bargain that defendant made (People v Ellsworth, 131 AD2d 109, 111; People v Bonk, 83 AD2d 695). As to defendant’s claim of his attorney’s failure to make pretrial motions, there was no basis for a Wade hearing, and a hearing pursuant to People v Darden (34 NY2d 177) was held after which County Court issued a written decision finding that the informant verified the information attributed to him in the search warrant, that the source of the informant’s information was from his own personal observations and from conversations with defendant, and it was found that the informant had given reliable information in the past. We agree with the determination of County Court that the test of People v Darden (supra) was satisfied.
We likewise find meritless defendant’s claim in regard to the excessiveness of his sentence. Considering defendant’s conviction of a class D felony and the seriousness of that charge, as well as defendant’s favorable plea bargain, the sentence was warranted (see, People v McAllister, 58 AD2d 712).
Finally, although nine months elapsed between defendant’s conviction and his sentencing, we do not find the delay unreasonable (see, Matter of Braunstein v Frawley, 64 AD2d 772, 773). Defendant’s judgment of conviction should be affirmed.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Fulton County (Hoye, J.), rendered April 3, 2009, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and attempted assault in the second degree.
Defendant was charged with various crimes as a result of his sale of narcotics to a confidential informant and a subsequent scuffle with police. A jury convicted him of five crimes—attempted assault in the second degree and two counts each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. This appeal ensued.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that he was deprived of a fair trial because a sitting juror should have been removed from the jury as grossly unqualified to serve (see CPL 270.35 [1]). This argument is unpreserved for our review because defendant did not object to the scope of County Court’s inquiry of the juror after she sent a note to the court (see People v Hicks, 6 NY3d 737, 739 [2005]; People v Kelly, 65 AD3d 714, 715 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 860 [2009]; People v Busreth, 35 AD3d 965, 967 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 920 [2007]), or request that she be discharged from the jury (see People v Brennan, 290 AD2d 574, 576 [2002], lv denied 97 NY2d 751 [2002]). In fact, after the court’s inquiry, defense counsel indicated that he had no further concerns regarding this juror. As defendant’s sole argument is unpreserved, we affirm.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Tomlinson, J.), rendered April 20, 2010, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts).
Defendant was convicted following a jury trial in 2002 of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts). He was thereafter sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 20 to 60 years. On appeal, this Court modified the sentence, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 6 to 21 years in prison (People v McCombs, 18 AD3d 888 [2005]). In 2009, defendant applied for resentencing pursuant to CPL 440.46 and was, upon agreement, resentenced to eight years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that his resentence is harsh and excessive insofar as it included a two-year period of postrelease supervision. Finding no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion, we decline to reduce the sentence—which was within the permissible statutory range—in the interest of justice (see People v Lerario, 50 AD3d 1396, 1396-1397 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 961 [2008]).

"— -Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Kepner, J.), rendered June 8, 1981, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree. Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sale of marihuana in the third degree after having sold marihuana to an undercover police officer on two separate occasions. The transactions were apparently arranged by defendant’s brother-in-law. On the morning trial was to commence, defendant, who had earlier requested his counsel to initiate plea bargaining, pleaded guilty to the first of the two counts with the understanding that the second count would be dismissed and that he would be sentenced to a term of one and one-half to three years, the minimum available to him as a second felony offender. During the colloquy preceding his guilty plea, defendant fully and freely admitted engaging in the criminal transaction covered by the first count of the indictment. It appears further that he completely understood the ramifications of his plea and that he had discussed the circumstances of the case, including the specific possibility of asserting two mutually exclusive defenses, alibi and entrapment, with his assigned counsel, the Chemung County Public Defender. At sentencing, defendant, claiming entrapment, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. His motion was denied and sentencing was adjourned until the attorney from the Public Defender’s office who had represented defendant at the plea proceeding could be present. At the adjourned sentencing hearing, the Public Defender again moved to withdraw the guilty plea and then, because of the attorney-client privilege and his participation in the plea negotiations, declined to comment further on the motion. Following the court’s rejection of defendant’s assertion that he possessed a valid entrapment defense, the bargained-for sentence was imposed. Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, predicated as it is upon the fact that his attorney advised him to plead guilty when he allegedly had a strong entrapment defense, is meritless. Serious obstacles confronted the Public Defender had he attempted to advance this defense at trial. These included the inherent difficulty of proving entrapment, defendant’s extensive criminal record, which undoubtedly would have been brought to light, and the formidable proof of guilt that two separate drug sales to the same police officer evidence. Moreover, a conviction after trial could have led to a maximum sentence of four to eight years. These circumstances suggest that defense counsel’s urging defendant to accept the plea bargain represented sound defense strategy (People v Tomaselli, 7 NY2d 350, 355). It is also charged that the court erred in failing to conduct an in-depth inquiry into the factual basis for defendant’s motion. When asked about the reason for withdrawing his guilty plea, defendant responded he was “going under entrapment”, that he had been “set up”. The sentencing Judge, who had questioned defendant at length when the plea was accepted and had heard defendant unequivocally declare his guilt and also specifically admit that he had discussed an entrapment defense with his attorney, was thoroughly justified in concluding that there was no substantive basis to the withdrawal motion (see People v Eagan, 90 AD2d 909; People v Mangini, 82 AD2d 940). It is also noteworthy that defendant made no attempt to alter his admission of guilt at the sentencing hearings. Also lacking in conviction is the suggestion that error occurred when the sentencing court neglected to assign new defense counsel after the Public Defender chose not to comment on the merits of the motion because of the attorney-client privilege. The Public Defender did not take an adverse position to defendant at sentencing and actually made the withdrawal motion on defendant’s request. Lack of further argument on counsel’s part worked no discernible prejudice to defendant’s case, and did not give rise to an adversity of interest necessitating the appointment of new counsel sua sponte (see People v Friedman, 39 NY2d 463, where appointment of new counsel was not required although defense counsel, facing similar circum stances, made statements which actually harmed the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered June 10, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant and 51 codefendants were charged in a 261-count indictment with various crimes related to a conspiracy to distribute and sell cocaine and heroin in multiple counties within New York and also in Vermont. Five of those counts encompassed crimes allegedly committed by defendant. In satisfaction thereof, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was to be sentenced to 4V2 years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. In exchange, defendant committed to providing “ongoing cooperation” with authorities in prosecuting a specified codefendant who was a major participant in the drug conspiracy. Thereafter, defendant refused to testify against this individual, only informing the People that there was “no way” he would testify against him. At sentencing and in regard to his failure to provide such testimony, defendant explained to County Court that he “didn’t feel like [he] had to testify to what [he had] admitted to” when he pleaded guilty and that the codefendant was incarcerated on the same tier at the local correctional facility. Thereafter, County Court sentenced defendant as a second violent felony offender to an enhanced sentence of 7V2 years in prison to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, defendant contends that County Court improperly enhanced his sentence because he was not expressly advised that the terms of the plea agreement included him having to testify against his codefendant. Although not precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, defendant has failed to preserve this claim as the record does not reveal that he raised it before County Court or made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Bucknor, 116 AD3d 1233, 1234 [2014]). Under the circumstances presented, we decline to exercise our interest of justice jurisdiction to take corrective action inasmuch as the plea agreement that was articulated on the record required defendant’s ongoing cooperation in prosecuting this specific code-fendant, which sufficiently encompassed the provision of testimony (compare People v Gabbidon, 96 AD3d 1235, 1235-1236 [2012]; People v Hastings, 24 AD3d 954, 955 [2005]).
Defendant further asserts that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea based upon the improper enhancement of his sentence. However, given the clear terms of the plea agreement, such motion would have been futile. The failure to pursue a motion that “has little or no chance of success” is not a basis for finding that counsel was ineffective (People v Caban, 5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see People v Thiel, 134 AD3d 1237, 1240 [2015], lv denied 27 NY3d 1156 [2016]).
Lastly, defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Scott, 139 AD3d 1266 [2016], lv denied 27 NY3d 1155 [2016]; People v Briggs, 138 AD3d 1355, 1357 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 927 [2016]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 7, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, upon the understanding that he would receive a sentence of probation so that he could work and attend college without interruption. County Court proved unwilling to impose a sentence of probation given defendant’s eventful criminal history and the fact that he quit his job prior to sentencing and, as a result, defendant withdrew his guilty plea. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty a second time, accepting the commitment of County Court to sentence him to six months in jail to be followed by five years of probation. County Court imposed that sentence, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s argument that County Court coerced him into pleading guilty is unpreserved due to his apparent failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d 1080, 1081 [2014]; People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d 880, 881 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1040 [2013]). Inasmuch as he made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or negated any elements of the crime to which he pleaded guilty, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is not applicable (see People v Jones, 114 AD3d at 1081). In any event, County Court did not engage in coercive conduct by advising defendant of his sentence exposure or warning him that plea negotiations were “finished” once the case was placed upon the trial calendar (see People v Feliciano, 108 AD3d at 882; People v Rivera, 290 AD2d 730, 731 [2002]).

In satisfaction of a multi-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that a sentence of 3 to 9 years in prison would be imposed. Defendant’s sentencing was postponed at her request, and she was released on her own recognizance so that she could take care of personal matters. In agreeing to the adjournment, County Court conditioned defendant’s release on defendant’s promise that, inter alia, she would appear for sentencing on the rescheduled date, and defendant was warned that her failure to appear could result in imposition of the harshest available sentence of 8V3 to 25 years in prison. Thereafter, defendant did not appear for sentencing and, when she was returned to court over a year later following her arrest and extradition from Kentucky, County Court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. This appeal followed and we affirm.
Contrary to defendant’s argument, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing an enhanced sentence under the circumstances of this case (see, e.g., People v Hughes, 260 AD2d 657, lv denied 93 NY2d 972; People v Whittaker, 257 AD2d 854, lv denied 93 NY2d 880). Although defendant claims that County Court failed to take into account her claim that she absconded due to fear of reprisals over a purported incident at the Broome County Jail, County Court appropriately ordered an investigation of the allegations. While County Court thereafter credited the fact that some type of altercation occurred, the court also noted that the incident took place several months prior to the plea allocution and defendant failed to bring her alleged fears to the attention of the court. Given defendant’s awareness of the consequences of violating the conditions of her release, we find no basis to reduce defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice. The remaining arguments raised by defendant have been examined and found to be unpersuasive.

Nevertheless, defendant argues that this record establishes the exception to the preservation rule which applies “[i]n the rare instance where ‘the defendant’s recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon the defendant’s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea’ ” (People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006, quoting People v Lopez, supra at 666). However, this exception will be invoked only when the trial court fails to probe further to ensure that the defendant’s plea is voluntary and the defendant understands the nature of the plea (see, People v Lopez, supra at 666).
Here, contrary to defendant’s argument, County Court conducted an inquiry into the benefit defendant received from participating in the sale and elicited sufficient facts supporting the conclusion that defendant acted with an “independent desire or inclination to promote the transaction” (People v Argibay, 45 NY2d 45, 54). Because County Court fulfilled its duty in this regard, defendant may not challenge the sufficiency of his plea on direct appeal (see, People v Lopez, supra at 666; People v Saitch, supra at 725).
Furthermore, we do not agree with defendant’s contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see, NY Const, art 1, § 6; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147). Defense counsel’s purported failure to effectuate defendant’s right to testify before the grand jury does not, per se, amount to ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Wiggins, 89 NY2d 872, 873) particularly where, as here, “defendant has failed to demonstrate the necessary absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel’s actions” (People v Richardson, 193 AD2d 969, 971, lv denied 82 NY2d 725; see, People v Brown, 232 AD2d 750, 752). Additionally, “[t]he mere fact that different attorneys assisted in the defendant’s case at different times does not render their assistance ineffective” (People v Hayes, 186 AD2d 268, 269). In any event, County Court appropriately inquired into defendant’s various general criticisms of counsel, as well as his speculative allegations of conflict of interest (see, People v Smith, 271 AD2d 752; People v Thornton, 167 AD2d 935, lv denied 78 NY2d 1082), and we find no reason to disagree with the court’s conclusion that the complaints were unsupported in the record.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schoharie County (Lamont, J.), rendered December 22, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of assault in the second degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree in satisfaction of a multicount superior court information, waiving his right to appeal. When the plea was entered, County Court agreed to impose a sentence of six months in jail and five years of probationary supervision. The commitment was conditioned upon, inter alia, defendant’s committing no Penal Law violations before the sentencing date. In the interim, however, defendant was arrested on a new charge. Defendant then agreed upon a disposition involving the new charge and a revised sentencing commitment on the assault charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of the new charges, waiving his right to appeal, and was subsequently sentenced to negotiated concurrent terms of 1 to 3 years in prison on the assault conviction and 2 to 6 years on the drug charge. He now appeals, challenging the validity and severity of the sentences imposed.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s arguments, County Court did not err in imposing a more severe sentence on the assault charge upon defendant’s breach of the conditional sentencing agreement (see, People v Gianfrate, 192 AD2d 970, 973, lv denied 82 NY2d 718). County Court clearly indicated that its original sentence commitment was conditional and, in the event one of the conditions were breached, it would not be bound by its sentencing commitment but that defendant would still “stand convicted”. We note that at no time did defendant seek vacatur of his guilty plea on the assault charge or deny commission of the new offense, to which he also pleaded guilty. Thus, there is no merit to his contention that the court erred in not conducting a summary hearing (see, People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713).
Finally, even if defendant had not knowingly waived his right to appeal in the context of his guilty pleas (see, People v Buchanan, 236 AD2d 741, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032), we would nevertheless find his claim that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive to be without merit in light of his prior criminal history and the nature of the crimes.

"McCarthy, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall Jr., J.), rendered June 26, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and was charged in a superior court information with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to this charge and waived his right to appeal, both orally and in writing. He was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement to four years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Defendant challenges the factual sufficiency of his plea allocution as well as the severity of his sentence. A valid waiver of the right to appeal precludes a defendant from raising these claims (see People v Torres, 117 AD3d 1497, 1498 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]; People v Perry, 50 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 963 [2008]). However, the record here reveals that defendant’s appeal waiver was deficient inasmuch as he was not clearly advised that the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty, and County Court did not make a proper inquiry to confirm that defendant had been advised and understood the significance of the written waiver (see People v Chappelle, 121 AD3d 1166, 1167 [2014]; People v Burgette, 118 AD3d 1034, 1035 [2014]). In view of this, defendant is not foreclosed from raising these claims. Nevertheless, the record does not indicate that defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea based upon the factual insufficiency of the allocution, which he now asserts, and for this reason his claim regarding the factual sufficiency of his plea is not preserved (see People v Wasley, 119 AD3d 1216, 1216 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1048 [2014]; see also People v O’Neill, 116 AD3d 1240, 1241 [2014]). The narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable inasmuch as the record does not disclose that defendant made statements casting doubt upon his guilt or negating a material element of the crime (see People v Rouse, 119 AD3d 1161, 1162-1163 [2014]; People v Pearson, 110 AD3d 1116, 1116 [2013]).
As for the sentence, it is neither harsh nor excessive. Defendant has a lengthy criminal record and he agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain. Consequently, we find no extraordinary circumstances nor any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Lussier, 109 AD3d 1023 [2013]; People v Rose, 79 AD3d 1365, 1367 [2010]).

"Appeal from separate judgments of the County Court of Ulster County, rendered May 12, 1976 and June 30, 1976, convicting each defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and sentencing each of them to a mandatory prison term with a minimum of six years and a maximum of life. Defendants were jointly indicted with two others for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and other offenses. Their pleas of guilty to reduced charges of criminal possession of cocaine in the second degree were accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. We find no merit in the defendants’ contention that the mandatory sentence provisions of section 70.00 of the Penal Law constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and are greatly disproportionate to the offenses committed. The constitutionality of this statute is beyond challenge (People v Jones, 39 NY2d 694; People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, cert den 423 US 950). The defendants urge that this is that ""rare case” which forbids routine application of the statute (see People v Broadie, supra, p 119). However, the record fails to disclose any circumstances which render the case unusual and different in any way from other criminal possession cases. Defendants contend cocaine is improperly classified as a narcotic drug for purposes of criminal punishment. We see no merit to this argument. The classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug rests entirely within the province of the Legislature and does not come within the ambit of our authority (see People v Portanova, 56 AD2d 265, 277). Without a showing of irrationality, we are unable to overturn the classification scheme. Defendants also argue that they were denied their rights to a prompt preliminary hearing (CPL 180.10, subd 2) and to appear before the Grand Jury (CPL 190.50, subd 5, par [a]). It is apparent even under the procedural scheme adopted by the Legislature in 1970 (L 1970, ch 996) that a defendant may be indicted while awaiting disposition of a felony complaint in a local criminal court (CPL 190.50, subd 5, par [a]; People v Talham, 41 AD2d 354), thus obviating any need for a preliminary hearing. Defendants were processed ""promptly” as the indictment came down nine days after arrest. As for defendants’ objection that they were denied their right to appear before the Grand Jury, CPL 190.50 (subd 5, par [c]) requires any objections to the indictment based on paragraph (a) of that subdivision to be raised within five days of the arraignment on the indictment (People v Washington, 42 AD2d 677). In this case objections were raised a year and one-half later. This was untimely. We have considered defendants’ other contentions and have found them to be without merit. Judgments affirmed.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered December 13, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant entered a plea bargain agreement whereby he would plead guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in exchange for a prison sentence of l1/2 to 41/2 years. County Court granted defendant an adjournment of his sentencing hearing until July 28, 1994 to enable him to be present at the birth of his girlfriend’s child, with the proviso that if he was arrested on new charges before sentencing or failed to appear at the sentencing hearing, County Court would not be bound by the promised sentence. Defendant violated the conditions of the plea bargain when he failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and was arrested on another charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. When defendant was finally returned to County Court, he was sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years. Because defendant violated the terms of the plea bargain agreement, County Court was free to impose a sentence greater than that promised as part of the agreement (see, People v Figgens, 87 NY2d 840, 841; People v Foss, 188 AD2d 940, lv denied 81 NY2d 1013).

"Lynch, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered May 10, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a three-count indictment with various drug-related crimes as the result of his sale of cocaine to an individual in the Town of Halfmoon, Saratoga County. Similar charges were also filed against defendant in Rensselaer County in connection with other drug sales. In satisfaction of the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to four years in prison, to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision ranging from IV2 to 3 years. The sentence was to run concurrently to the sentence imposed by Rensselear County Court in connection with the charges pending there. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and a three-year period of postrelease supervision was imposed. He now appeals.
Initially, contrary to defendant’s claim, we find that defendant entered a valid waiver of the right to appeal. Although County Court ambiguously stated that the waiver forfeited defendant’s right to appeal “either the plea or sentence,” the written waiver, which defendant executed in open court, clarified that it encompassed the plea as well as the sentence and defendant indicated that he had discussed it with counsel and understood the consequences of the waiver (see People v Fling, 112 AD3d 1001, 1002 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1020 [2014]). Moreover, County Court properly advised defendant that his waiver of the right to appeal was separate and distinct from the other rights that he was forfeiting by pleading guilty (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Fate, 117 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2014]). Accordingly, under the circumstances presented, we find that the waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; People v Fligger, 117 AD3d 1343, 1344 [2014], lv denied 23 NY3d 1061 [2014]).
Defendant maintains that County Court failed to comply with an important condition of the plea agreement, which was that his sentence include a provision that he serve time in the Willard drug treatment program just as Rensselear County Court had directed as part of the sentence it imposed. Based upon this, he argues that his guilty plea was not voluntary. Although defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal does not preclude him from challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea, he has failed to preserve this claim for review by making an appropriate postallocution motion or by objecting at the sentencing (see People v Tole, 119 AD3d 982, 983 [2014]; People v Fate, 117 AD3d at 1328; People v Haynes, 14 AD3d 789, 790-791 [2005], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]). In any event, there is no support in the record for defendant’s assertion that the plea agreement implicitly included a provision that, upon his incarceration, defendant would participate in the Willard drug treatment program. To the contrary, County Court specifically made it clear that this was not a component of the sentence, a point expressly acknowledged by defense counsel. Lastly, defendant’s challenge to the severity of the sentence is precluded by his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Fligger, 117 AD3d at 1344; People v Fling, 112 AD3d at 1002).

"—Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered November 18, 1994, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of the said court, entered August 1, 1995, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
Defendant, who pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 41/ 2 to 9 years, now claims that County Court improperly adjudicated him as a second felony offender. On the day of the plea allocution, the People filed a statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 charging that defendant previously had been convicted within this State of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, which constituted a predicate felony. At the plea allocution, defendant unequivocally indicated that he understood that he was pleading guilty to the instant crime as a second felony offender in light of that prior conviction and that he in fact committed said prior crime. Notably defendant, who was represented by counsel and consulted with him, raised no challenge to County Court’s consideration of his prior conviction and, at the time of sentencing, made no objection to being sentenced as a second felony offender. Under these circumstances, we find that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see, People v Ford, 157 AD2d 992, lv denied 75 NY2d 919).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Keegan, J.), rendered July 9, 1991, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging her with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. The plea bargain included an agreed-upon sentence and was made in full satisfaction of other criminal charges pending against her. At sentencing defendant sought to withdraw her plea, contending that she misunderstood the significance of a Grand Jury proceeding and that she was innocent. County Court denied the application. Defendant appeals her conviction.
We reject defendant’s .contention that her application to withdraw her plea was improvidently denied. Prior to sentencing defendant retained new counsel. Upon the original sentencing date new counsel orally sought to withdraw defendant’s plea upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sentencing was adjourned one week to provide defendant with the opportunity to order a transcription of the plea minutes. Upon the rescheduled sentencing date, defense counsel orally renewed defendant’s motion.
There is no suggestion in the record that defendant was not given an adequate opportunity to present her contentions. Quite the contrary to her generalized protestation of innocence at sentencing, prior to her guilty plea defendant extensively and specifically stated the circumstances of the crime. She pleaded guilty only after consultation with her attorney and after detailed explanation and inquiry by County Court concerning her rights and the crime. Nothing therein inti mates that defendant’s guilty plea was improvident or baseless. Only in the rare instance, not present in the instant case, will a defendant be entitled to an evidentiary hearing (People v Frederick, 45 NY2d 520, 525). Under the circumstances here, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s application (People v Lynch, 156 AD2d 884, lv denied 75 NY2d 921).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered January 28, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of several charges contained in two separate indict ments pending against him in Albany County, with the understanding that a prison sentence of 6 to 18 years would be imposed. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea, claiming that he had not had enough time to consider the offer and that he was innocent. County Court denied defendant’s motion and proceeded to sentence him as agreed. Defendant now appeals.
Review of the record confirms that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. County Court informed defendant of the rights he was relinquishing by pleading guilty and the ramifications thereof. Defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights, that he had not been threatened or coerced into entering the plea and that he had been afforded adequate time to discuss his choice with counsel representing him on each of the indictments. Additionally, during the plea colloquy defendant unequivocally admitted the alleged conduct and his subsequent claims of innocence were not substantiated by anything other than his own conclusory statements. Under these circumstances, County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea was proper (see People v King, 20 AD3d 580, 581 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 829 [2005]; People v Coss, 19 AD3d 943, 943-944 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 805 [2005]; People v Watson, 8 AD3d 911, 911-912 [2004]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J), rendered June 14, 2010, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was thereafter sentenced, pursuant to the plea agreement, to a term of imprisonment of two years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we affirm.
Defendant’s challenge to the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal is unpersuasive. Our review of the plea colloquy and the written waiver executed by defendant reveals that he was apprised of and clearly understood the rights that he was forfeiting, including the right to appeal his sentence (see People v Sylvan, 107 AD3d 1044, 1045 [2013]; People v Benson, 100 AD3d 1108, 1108 [2012]). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Defendant’s sole remaining contention on appeal, that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, is precluded by his valid appeal waiver (see People v Marshall, 108 AD3d 884, 884 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 957 [2013]; People v Ferro, 101 AD3d 1243, 1244 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams Jr., J.), rendered June 11, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (two counts).
Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of the reduced charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree in satisfaction of a four-count indictment. As part of the agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal. County Court thereafter imposed the agreed-upon sentence of two consecutive one-year jail terms and ordered restitution in the amount of $360. Defendant appeals.
Defendant argues on appeal that the restitution component of his sentence should be vacated because, at the time of the plea, neither County Court nor the People advised him that restitution would be required as a condition of the plea agreement. As the People concede, the record reflects that, while restitution had been included in a prior plea offer that defendant had rejected, it was not included as a part of this plea agreement. Accordingly, under these circumstances, neither defendant’s unchallenged waiver of appeal nor his failure to preserve this issue through an objection at sentencing precludes this claim (see People v Rubio, 133 AD3d 1041, 1042 [2015]; People v Culcleasure, 75 AD3d 832, 832 [2010]).
The sole relief that defendant requests on appeal is modification of his sentence to vacate the provision requiring that he make restitution, and the People consent to that relief—representing that defendant has been released from custody. Under the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to vacate the provision of defendant’s sentence imposing restitution, thereby conforming the sentence imposed to the promise made to defendant in exchange for his guilty plea (see People v Nilsen, 129 AD3d 994, 995 [2015]; cf. People v Gregory, 140 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2016]; People v Roberts, 139 AD3d 1092, 1092 [2016]; People v Sheats, 138 AD3d 894, 894-895 [2016]).

"Devine, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J), rendered August 22, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of an indictment, a probation violation and an uncharged crime, and waived his right to appeal. Pursuant to the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced to four years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. The terms of the plea agreement included the requirement that defendant cooperate with the Probation Department in its preparation of the presentence investigation report, which included answering its inquiries in conformity with his representations during the plea allocution and accepting responsibility for his crime. County Court warned defendant that he could receive an enhanced sentence of up to 12 years in prison if he violated the terms of the plea agreement. At sentencing, defendant acknowledged that he made statements to the Probation Department that were inconsistent with those made during the plea allocution. County Court thereafter found him in violation of the plea agreement and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to 5V2 years in prison, to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Contrary to defendant’s contention, we find that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, as the record demonstrates that County Court distinguished the right to appeal from the rights automatically forfeited by his guilty plea and defendant acknowledged his understanding of the ramifications of the waiver and executed a written waiver in open court (see People v Fate, 117 AD3d 1327, 1328 [2014]; People v Sczepankowski, 110 AD3d 1115, 1115 [2013]). Defendant’s contention that his guilty plea was involuntary, which survives his appeal waiver, is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as the record does not reflect that he made an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Lewis, 118 AD3d 1125, 1125 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1003 [2014]; People v Vandemark, 117 AD3d 1339, 1340 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 965 [2014]). Moreover, defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that negated an essential element of the crime or otherwise cast doubt upon his guilt so as to trigger the exception to the preservation rule (see People v Wasley, 119 AD3d 1216, 1216-1217 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1048 [Nov. 25, 2014]; People v Santiago, 118 AD3d 1032, 1033 [2014]). To the extent that defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea, it also survives his appeal waiver, but is likewise unpreserved for our review in the absence of an appropriate postallocution motion (see People v Wiley, 112 AD3d 998, 998 [2013]; People v Walton, 101 AD3d 1489, 1490 [2012]).
Contrary to defendant’s contention, County Court was justified in imposing an enhanced sentence, inasmuch as defendant admittedly violated an explicit condition of the plea agreement (see People v Coffey, 77 AD3d 1202, 1203-1204 [2010], lv denied 18 NY3d 882 [2012]; People v Faulkner, 54 AD3d 1134, 1135 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 854 [2008]). Finally, defendant’s contention that the enhanced sentence is harsh and excessive is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, inasmuch as County Court informed him of the plea conditions and the maximum sentence that could be imposed if he violated the plea agreement (see People v Thomas, 81 AD3d 997, 998 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 900 [2011]; People v Bove, 64 AD3d 812, 813 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 858 [2009]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered May 28, 1996, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant was originally sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 2 to 4 years and placed on parole supervision following his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in satisfaction of a two-count indictment. In light of a prior felony conviction, however, defendant was disqualified from participating in the parole supervision program; consequently, the parole supervision provision of defendant’s sentence was revoked and he was resentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 2 to 4 years. Defendant now contends that the sentence was harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. We disagree. Defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that the People would recommend the prison term which was ultimately imposed. Moreover, defendant was permitted to plead to a lesser included offense of the first count of the indictment and received the most lenient sentence allowed by statute (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [d]; [4] [b]). Under the circumstances presented here, we perceive no reason to disturb the sentence imposed (see, People v Atkinson, 238 AD2d 628, lv denied 90 NY2d 854).

"Mercure, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered January 31, 2007, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, in full satisfaction of two pending indictments, with the understanding that he would receive a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years to life. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of seven years to life. Following an unsuccessful appeal (28 AD3d 872 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 758 [2006]) and various postconviction motions, County Court granted defendant’s application for resentencing pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (L 2005, ch 643, § 1), and scheduled a resentencing hearing. At the conclusion thereof, County Court resentenced defendant to determinate prison terms of five years on each count, to run consecutively, with five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we now modify, by vacating the sentence imposed.
Our analysis starts by recognizing that County Court failed to follow the proper procedures when resentencing defendant pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005. Although defendant failed to preserve this argument for appellate review, we conclude that modification in the interest of justice is warranted (see CPL 470.15 [1]). Once it is determined that a defendant is eligible to be resentenced pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005, the sentencing court must “specify and inform such person of the term of a determinate sentence of imprisonment it would impose upon such conviction . . . and shall enter an order to that effect” (L 2005, ch 643, § 1; see People v Love, 46 AD3d 919, 920-921 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 842 [2008]). The court must then notify the defendant that unless he or she either withdraws the application to be resentenced or appeals from the order, the court will vacate the previous sentence and impose the determinate sentence (see L 2005, ch 643, § 1; People v Love, 46 AD3d at 921).
Here, County Court proceeded to resentence defendant without issuing an order specifying the determinate sentence that would be imposed upon resentencing and without ensuring that defendant was aware of his right to withdraw his resentencing application or appeal the resentence order (cf. People v Bennett, 31 AD3d 298, 299 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 846 [2006]). Inasmuch as the new sentence is not “a much more favorable sentence than the one originally imposed” (People v Paniagua, 45 AD3d 98, 102 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 992 [2007]), we vacate the resentence and remit to give defendant an opportunity to make an informed decision regarding whether to withdraw his resentence application or appeal the resentence order (see People v Love, 46 AD3d at 921).
Defendant’s remaining arguments are rendered academic by our decision.

"— Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main, Jr., J.), rendered January 29, 2001, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree.
Criminal charges were brought against defendant after she was observed vandalizing a vehicle in a grocery store parking lot while she had two children with her. In satisfaction of such charges, she pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in the third degree. No sentencing commitment was made in connection with the plea, although County Court thoroughly explained to defendant the sentencing options available, including potential incarceration and restitution. County Court further explained that defendant would be required, as part of the plea, to waive her right to appeal everything except for the sentence. After defendant waived her right to appeal and County Court accepted her plea, it sentenced her to 180 days in jail, to be followed by five years’ probation. County Court also imposed an order of protection and required defendant to pay restitution, together with a surcharge, of $511.41, a fine of $2,000, a mandatory felony conviction surcharge of $200 and a crime victim’s assistance fee of $10.
Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. She takes particular issue with the amended condition of probation requiring the presence of an adult during any contact with an unrelated minor. Given the circumstances of the crime, which was committed in the presence of two young children and while defendant was on probation for violating a prior order of protection that had been issued in favor of the same victim, we find no extraordinary circumstances or abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Wright, 233 AD2d 618 [1996]; see also People v Hale, 268 AD2d 691 [2000]). Therefore, we decline to disturb the judgment of conviction.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chenango County (Dowd, J.), rendered August 21, 1992, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of sodomy in the first degree and bail jumping in the second degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to sodomy in the first degree and bail jumping in the second degree and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 7 to 21 years for the sodomy conviction and 116 to 4 years for the bail jumping conviction. On this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in accepting his guilty plea without a sufficient inquiry to ensure that defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect which would negate the intent element of the crimes at issue.
Our review of the plea allocution reveals that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Further, County Court’s colloquy with defendant revealed no facts suggesting that a mental disease or defect negated defendant’s intent.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered July 12, 1977, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of eight and one-third years to life. Defendant was convicted upon a charge of selling heroin to one George Cesario, Jr., a police informant, on the 19th day of November, 1976 at approximately 8:00 a.m. On this appeal defendant urges that it was reversible error for the trial court to deny his motion for an order dismissing the indictment on the ground that the prosecution was barred by reason of a previous conviction for a different sale to the same informant. A previous indictment, which also resulted in a conviction, alleged that the defendant on or about the 17th day of November, 1976, at approximately 8:08 a.m., sold heroin to one George Cesario, Jr., the police informant. The two sales to the same person at the same place were 48 hours apart. As such, they constituted separate and distinct offenses (People v Paul, 37 NY2d 100). The separate offenses were not so closely related or connected in point of time and circumstance as to constitute a single criminal incident and, thus, CPL 40.20 (subd 2) is inapplicable. On the conviction for the first sale, the trial court imposed a sentence of seven years to life and on the second conviction for the second sale, some 48 hours later to the same informant, the triál court imposed a sentence of eight and one-third years to life. Discretion in the imposition of sentence rests with the trial court and should not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion (People v Thiel, 25 NY2d 926; People v West, 52 AD2d 968). The sentence imposed was legally permissible and on such facts we find no abuse of discretion. The defendant’s remaining contention is that the District Attorney’s summation was so prejudicial, improper and inflammatory as to require a reversal. We have examined the record herein and find that contention to be without merit, especially in view of the trial court’s prompt and proper ruling in that regard. Judgment affirmed. Sweeney, J.

Appeal from an order of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), entered January 11, 2016, which denied defendant’s motion for a conditional order pursuant to CPL 160.58 sealing her criminal record, without a hearing.
In 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class E felony, in satisfaction of accusatory instruments charging her with multiple drug-related crimes. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant agreed to participate in the Albany County Drug Treatment Court program and, if successful, would be permitted to withdraw her felony guilty plea and plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Defendant successfully completed the program and, in 2010, withdrew her original plea and entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a class A misdemeanor. In 2015, defendant moved for a conditional order pursuant to CPL 160.58 sealing the record pertaining to her conviction. The People did not oppose the motion, but County Court denied it without conducting a hearing. Defendant now appeals.
CPL 160.58, which was enacted as part of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2009 (L 2009, ch 56, § 1, part AAA, § 3), provides that criminal defendants who have been convicted of specified offenses, have successfully completed certain drug treatment programs and have served the sentences imposed for such offenses are eligible to have the record of their offenses conditionally sealed (see CPL 160.58 [1]; Peter Preiser, 2009 Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 160.58, 2017 Supp Pamph at 177-178). The decision of whether to grant an application to conditionally seal a criminal record is within the discretion of the sentencing court (see Peter Preiser, 2009 Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 160.58, 2017 Supp Pamph at 178). Notably, CPL 160.58 (3) provides that, in making such determinations, “the court shall consider any relevant factors, including but not limited to: (i) the circumstances and seriousness of the offense or offenses that resulted in the conviction or convictions; (ii) the character of the defendant, including his or her completion of [a] judicially sanctioned treatment program . . . ; (iii) the defendant’s criminal history; and (iv) the impact of sealing the defendant’s records upon his or her rehabilitation and his or her successful and productive reentry and reintegration into society, and on public safety” (emphasis added).
In denying defendant’s motion, County Court relied upon the absence of a provision in the plea agreement indicating that defendant’s criminal record would be conditionally sealed. However, given that defendant’s plea agreement was entered into prior to the enactment of the statute, it could not have included a provision addressing the conditional sealing of her criminal record, and the absence of such a provision is not dis-positive. Significantly, CPL 160.58 has been held to be applicable to convictions preceding its enactment (see People v M.E., 121 AD3d 157, 160-161 [2014]). Therefore, County Court should have reviewed defendant’s motion in light of the factors set forth in CPL 160.58 (3).
That said, under the particular circumstances presented and given that the record in this matter is complete, we shall consider the motion applying the relevant statutory criteria, rather than remitting this matter to County Court for that purpose. The record establishes that defendant’s misdemeanor conviction is her sole criminal offense, she has not been arrested since 2008, she has successfully completed the drug court program (thereby avoiding incarceration), she has obtained a college degree and maintained gainful employment and she continues to participate in Narcotics Anonymous. Further, although defendant has received a certificate of relief from civil disabilities, her criminal record is likely to be an impediment to both the furtherance of her career and her future employment prospects. In view of the foregoing, and given that the People now concur with the relief requested by defendant, her motion should be granted and the record of her criminal conviction conditionally sealed pursuant to CPL 160.58.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Feeney, J.), rendered January 4, 2006, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a three-count indictment charging various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that if she failed to successfully complete a drug treatment court program, she would be sentenced to 21k to 7 years in prison. She thereafter failed to complete the program and, as a result, County Court sentenced her to a prison term of 2V2 to 7 years. This appeal by defendant ensued.
Defendant argues, and the People concede, that the sentence of 2V2 to 7 years is illegal. Based upon our review of the record and Penal Law § 70.00 (1) and (3) (b), as it read in November 2003 when defendant committed her crime, we agree. The sentence imposed was impermissible inasmuch as the minimum period of imprisonment was greater than one third of the maximum (see Penal Law former § 70.00 [1], [3] [b]). Accordingly, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court for resentencing. In light of our disposition, we need not address defendant’s remaining claim that the sentence was harsh and excessive.

"Spain, J.P.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered July 24, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fourth degrees. Prior to the commencement of a Dunaway/Mapp/Huntley hearing, defendant was offered a prison term of 41/2 to 9 years which would be withdrawn once the suppression hearing began. After confer ring with his attorney, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, acknowledging that he had an opportunity to speak with his attorney and was satisfied with his representation. The colloquy reflects that defendant understood that he was giving up certain rights associated with a jury trial, acknowledged that he was not forced or threatened into pleading guilty, and specifically understood that he was giving up his right to a suppression hearing. County Court also elicited an appeal waiver from defendant, and defendant admitted that he possessed more than one eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of 4V2 to 9 years, defendant appealed. This Court rejected a previous Anders brief (9 AD3d 740 [2004]), new counsel was assigned, and we now affirm.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea, while not encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal, is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Hughes, 3 AD3d 736, 736 [2004]; People v Ward, 2 AD3d 1219, 1219 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 808 [2004]). Even considering defendant’s challenge, we find that the plea was in all respects knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Willis, 3 AD3d 793, 793-794 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 766 [2004]; People v Hughes, supra at 736). The fact that County Court would not extend the offer once the suppression hearing began does not support the inference that the plea was coerced (see People v Coleman, 8 AD3d 825, 826 [2004]).
Defendant’s assertion that his arrest was unlawful does not survive his knowing and intelligent guilty plea and unqualified waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Kemp, 94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; People v Allen, 82 NY2d 761, 763 [1993]; People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911 [1990]; People v Fernandez, 67 NY2d 686, 688 [1986]; People v Atwood, 9 AD3d 512, 513 [2004]). Moreover, defendant was specifically advised that his plea would waive his right to a suppression hearing (see People v Williams, 6 AD3d 746, 747 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 650 [2004]). Similarly, his challenge to the sentence, which was imposed exactly as agreed in the plea, does not survive his waiver of appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; People v Kalenak, 2 AD3d 902, 903 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 629 [2004]; People v Bier, 307 AD2d 649, 651 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 618 [2003]).
We have reviewed defendant’s remaining claims, including those raised in his pro se submission, and find that they are precluded by his valid appeal waiver and otherwise lack merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered March 23, 2000, upon a verdict convicting defendant of three counts of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The jury found defendant guilty on the counts of criminal possession and acquitted him on the counts of criminal sale. County Court thereafter sentenced defendant to 8V3 to 25 years in prison on each count with the sentences to run consecutively. Contending that the jury’s verdict was repugnant and his sentence excessive, defendant now appeals.
“A repugnant or inconsistent verdict occurs ‘where the defendant is convicted of an offense containing an essential element that the jury has found the defendant did not commit (see, CPL 300.30 [5] [“(t)wo counts are ‘inconsistent’ when guilt of the offense charged in one necessarily negates guilt of the offense charged in the other”])’ ” (People v Long, 291 AD2d 720, 722, lv denied 98 NY2d 677, quoting People v Trappier, 87 NY2d 55, 58; see People v Tucker, 55 NY2d 1, 6; People v Hart, 266 AD2d 584, 585, lv denied 94 NY2d 903). In other words, we can determine whether or not a jury reached an “inherently self-contradictory verdict” only by looking at the jury charge in the record (People v Tucker, supra at 8). This limitation exists to prevent appellate courts from intruding into the “jury’s deliberative process by speculating on how the jury perceived and weighed the evidence” (id. at 7).
As County Court correctly instructed the jury, a person commits criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree by knowingly and unlawfully selling a narcotic drug (see Penal Law § 220.39 [1]). By contrast, a person commits criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree when he or she knowingly and unlawfully possesses a narcotic drug with intent to sell it (see Penal Law § 220.16 [1]). Defendant’s acquittal on the former does not negate the elements of the latter, for a person can possess and intend to sell a narcotic drug, but not actually accomplish a sale (see People v Ortiz, 170 AD2d 396, 397, lvs denied 77 NY2d 998, 78 NY2d 1079). Also, the evidence supports County Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to set aside the verdict as inconsistent on the grounds that his possession of the heroin was proven by other circumstantial evidence and was not dependent on the confidential informant’s testimony. Thus, it was not inherently irrational for the jury to have found the elements of criminal possession while discrediting the informant’s testimony as to the sale (see id. at 397; People v Coleman, 120 AD2d 770, 771-772, lv denied 68 NY2d 810).
Finally, defendant challenges the severity of his sentence, which consisted of the maximum permissible term of imprisonment on each count of criminal possession (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [b]; [3] [b]). Running consecutively, those terms aggregate 25 to 75 years in prison. While aware that this period will be administratively reduced to a term of 15 to 30 years (see Penal Law § 70.30 [1] [e] [iii] [B]; People v Sheppard, 273 AD2d 498, 500, lv denied 95 NY2d 908), we nevertheless find it appropriate to further reduce the sentence in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Delgado, 80 NY2d 780) by directing that the terms imposed shall run concurrently (see People v Harris, 288 AD2d 610, 619, lv granted 97 NY2d 705; People v Lockenwitz, 287 AD2d 891, 892; People v Sheppard, supra at 500). This reduction is warranted by defendant’s young age, the absence of any prior arrests or convictions other than his plea of guilty to a charge of attempted assault in the first degree during the pendency of the drug charges, the absence of violence in his drug offenses, and the fact that two of the drug possessions, though separate, occurred within 30 minutes of each other and all three of them involved the same informant.
Crew III, J.P., Carpinello, Mugglin and Kane, JJ., concur.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Kane, J.), rendered May 14, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
As part of his plea of guilty to two of the crimes charged in a five-count indictment, defendant waived his right to appeal. Insofar as he failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction, he may not now challenge the sufficiency of his plea. In any event, were we to consider the merits, we would find on this record that the plea was knowing and voluntary. In addition, we reject defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Finally, considering that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender and in accordance with the plea agreement, we do not find that the sentence imposed of 6x/2 to 13 years in prison was harsh or excessive. We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Nichols, J.), rendered April 17, 2007, convicting defen dant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (four counts).
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (four counts). With no sentencing promises having been made, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony drug offender to an aggregate term of imprisonment of six years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We discern no merit in defendant’s contention that his sentence is harsh and excessive. The record reveals neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of any extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Favor, 49 AD3d 915, 916 [2008]).

Appeals from a judgment of the County Court of Franklin County (Main Jr., J.), rendered February 6, 2012, (1) upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and (2) convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of burglary in the third degree.
After a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged of crim inal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree for selling oxycodone, a narcotic drug, to a confidential informant during a controlled buy overseen by law enforcement officers. At sentencing, defendant accepted a plea agreement pursuant to which he entered a guilty plea to burglary in the third degree in satisfaction of an unrelated eight-count indictment, admitted for all purposes that he was a second felony offender, and waived his right to appeal the conviction and sentence in both cases. The plea also satisfied another four-count indictment that was scheduled for trial charging him with evidence tampering and other crimes. In exchange, defendant was promised a sentence of 3V2 to 7 years in prison for the criminal sale conviction and no more than 10 years for the burglary conviction, with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon sentence on the criminal sale conviction, and to a concurrent term of 10 years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision on the burglary conviction. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, upon review of the record, we find that, contrary to defendant’s contentions, his guilty plea and appeal waivers were knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered (see People v Brown, 14 NY3d 113, 116 [2010]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; People v Morales, 68 AD3d 1356, 1356-1357 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 803 [2010] [waived appeal as to both a jury verdict and an unrelated plea as part of one negotiated deal]; People v Cipriani, 61 AD3d 1214, 1215 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009] [same]). County Court outlined all of the terms of the plea agreement on the record, explained the consequences of the guilty plea and the trial-related rights that defendant was forgoing, and elicited his understanding of each of the terms. When a question arose as to whether the appeal waiver would apply to both the criminal sale and the burglary convictions, the court took a recess and conferred with the parties, following which the court placed on the record the parties’ understanding that defendant would be waiving his right to appeal all aspects of both convictions with two specified qualifications (see People v Morales, 68 AD3d at 1357). Defendant then admitted the acts constituting burglary in the third degree and the court engaged in an extended colloquy before accepting his guilty plea to the burglary count. During that allocution, the court explained the appeal waiver, advising that a defendant may “ordinarily appeal any decision, [o]rder, or ruling of the court which he [or she] believes to be legally incorrect or otherwise inappropriate” but that, as a separate part of his plea agreement, defendant would be required, as agreed, to waive his right to appeal “all aspects of the proceeding except any of a constitutional nature and . . . any violation] by the court of its sentencing commitment;” defendant expressly agreed to the appeal waiver as to the burglary conviction. The court then separately elicited defendant’s agreement to the identical qualified appeal waiver as to the criminal sale conviction, after ascertaining that he had discussed the waiver with counsel, who was satisfied that defendant understood it. Thus, contrary to defendant’s appellate claims, the court carefully explained the appeal waiver and distinguished it from the other rights that defendant was forgoing as a consequence of his guilty plea, established that defense counsel had discussed it with him, engaged defendant in separate appeal waiver colloquies as to each conviction, and did not mislead him as to the plea terms or scope of the appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256-257; People v Morey, 110 AD3d 1378, 1378-1379 [2013]).
Given that County Court “ma[de] certain that . . . defendant’s understanding of the terms and conditions of [the] plea agreement [were] evident on the face of the record,” which reflects “that [the appeal waivers were] made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily,” they will be given full effect (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256; see People v Calvi, 89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]). As a consequence of “pleading guilty and waiving the right to appeal, . . . defendant has forgone review of the terms of the plea, including the harshness or excessiveness of the sentence” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 256). Likewise, defendant’s nonconstitutional challenges to the court’s Molineux ruling are encompassed within and precluded by his appeal waiver (see People v Barrier, 7 AD3d 885, 886 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 670 [2004]; see also People v Morales, 68 AD3d at 1357), as is his contention regarding the court’s admission into evidence of the tape recording and transcript of the drug sale (see People v Mercer, 81 AD3d 1159, 1160 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 999 [2012]).
Defendant’s argument that his right to confront witnesses against him at trial under the 6th Amendment was violated is a constitutional claim that he reserved in his qualified appeal waiver, but we find that it has no merit. Defendant contends that County Court erred when it admitted into evidence the controlled substance report documenting that the substance in issue was oxycodone, where Clifford Brant, the State Police forensic scientist who performed the chemical analysis and prepared the report, testified at trial, but his supervisor, Margaret Lafond — who cosigned the report — did not testify. The Confrontation Clause of the 6th Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees a defendant in a criminal prosecution the right to be “confronted with witnesses against him [or her]” (US Const 6th Amend), which precludes the “admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he [or she] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant. . . had a prior opportunity for cross-examination” (Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 53-54 [2004]). The US Supreme Court held in Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts (557 US 305 [2009]) that a sworn report from a state laboratory identifying a substance for purposes of a criminal prosecution is testimonial, and that the analysts were witnesses for purposes of the 6th Amendment who the accused was entitled to confront (id. at 310-311). The Court further held that, absent proof that such analysts were unavailable and that the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, his right of confrontation was violated (id.; see Bullcoming v New Mexico, 564 US —, —, 131 S Ct 2705, 2716-2717 [2011]; People v Pealer, 20 NY3d 447, 453-454 [2013], cert denied 571 US —, 134 S Ct 105 [2013]; People v Brown, 13 NY3d 332, 338-339 [2009]).
Here, unlike Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, Brant — the analyst who identified the oxycodone, performed the chemical tests on it, determined the nature of the substance, and authored the report — in fact testified and was subject to cross-examination (see People v Raucci, 109 AD3d 109,121-122 [2013]; compare People v Morrison, 90 AD3d 1554, 1556-1557 [4th Dept 2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 1028 [2012], reconsideration denied 20 NY3d 934 [2012] [the analyst who performed the forensic tests and drew conclusions was not called to testify but, rather, the analyst’s supervisor testified, who did not perform her own independent review or analysis]). The report is certified pursuant to CPL 190.30 (2) with the following language: “I, Clifford E. Brant, . . . hereby certify” and then states that it is “my [i.e. Brant’s] report and contains the opinions and interpretations of the examination I performed in the above referenced case” (emphasis added). Brant also testified that Lafond cosigned the report after an administrative review of it, as required by State Police protocol. There is no support in the record for the proposition that Lafond examined or analyzed the substance, observed Brant doing so, or was signing the report in that capacity. Indeed, Brant testified that after he alone performed the foren sic chemical testing, he sealed, signed and dated the laboratory bag containing the pill, which remained intact as of the trial, supporting the conclusion that Lafond only read and signed the report after it was completed to ensure that proper procedure was followed (see e.g. People v Morrison, 90 AD3d at 1556-1557), and she had no role in ascertaining or verifying the identity of the substance in issue. Thus, the “actual analyst who performed the tests” (id. at 1557) and “wr[o]te [the] report[ ]” (Bullcoming v New Mexico, 564 US at, 131 S Ct at 2715) testified. We find that Lafond, who neither analyzed the substance in issue nor authored the report, was not a “witness” against defendant for purposes of the Confrontation Clause (cf. Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts, 557 US at 311) and, accordingly, no Crawford violation occurred as a result of the People admitting Brant’s report into evidence without calling Lafond to testify.
Defendant’s remaining claims also lack merit.

Ordinarily, issues that survive an appeal waiver include a challenge to the legality of the sentence (see People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]) or any issue that “involve[s] a right of constitutional dimension going to ‘the very heart of the process’ ” (People v Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255, quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered November 8, 2007, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance"" in the third degree.
In 2007, in satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony (see Penal Law §§ 110.00, 110.05, 220.16 [1]). In' accord with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced him as a nonviolent second felony offender to a prison term of three years, to be executed as a parole supervision sentence, thus allowing for his participation in a drug treatment program. Defendant appeals.
The sentence imposed was not authorized by law. At the time of the plea and sentencing, defendant’s conviction for a class C felony did not qualify for a disposition of parole supervision (see Penal Law former § 70.70 [3] [b] [i]; [d]; CPL former 410.91 [5]). We are required to vacate the sentence, notwithstanding the People’s argument that the error favored defendant (see People v Cameron, 83 NY2d 838, 840 [1994]). “[T]his [C]ourt cannot permit a sentence which is invalid as a matter of law to stand” (People v Peale, 122 AD2d 353, 354 [1986]; see CPL 470.15 [2] [c]; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d 920, 921 [1984]). Further, as the error affected the sentence both as promised at the time of the plea and as later imposed, it rendered the plea involuntary, and defendant must be allowed the opportunity to withdraw his plea and stand trial (see People v Cameron, 83 NY2d at 840; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 239-240 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975]; People v Gustafson, 101 AD2d at 921). In light of this disposition, it is unnecessary to address defendant’s remaining contentions.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Austin, J.), rendered August 30, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and assault in the second degree (three counts).
In March 2000, defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, coercion in the first degree and rape in the first degree. His counsel subsequently made an omnibus motion seeking, inter alia, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he was deprived of his statutory right to testify before the grand jury. County Court declined to dismiss the indictment on this basis. While incarcerated on the stated charges, defendant was involved in an altercation with two other inmates. He subsequently waived indictment, and was charged in a superior court information with two counts of assault in the second degree as a result of this incident.
Thereafter, defendant agreed to plead guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of assault in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment, superior court information and other then pending weapons charges. The plea agreement included a waiver of defendant’s right to appeal and the imposition of an indeterminate prison term of 5 to 10 years on the criminal sale charge and determinate three-year prison terms on each of the assault charges, all to run concurrently. Defendant proceeded to enter his plea and was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement.
Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant, asserting that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Defendant, in his pro se brief, argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and that County Court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. Defendant’s waiver of appeal “preclude [s] review of his claimed denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel except insofar as the alleged ineffective assistance impacted on the voluntary nature of his plea” (People v Conyers, 227 AD2d 793, 793, lv denied 88 NY2d 982). Defendant’s three contentions with regard to ineffective assistance of counsel are either unrelated to the voluntariness of his plea or are directly contradicted by the record which clearly establishes that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into this plea agreement. As for defendant’s contention that County Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant’s plea forecloses consideration of such claim (see People v Harris, 293 AD2d 818, lv denied 98 NY2d 676).
In short, our review of the record, the brief submitted by defense counsel and defendant’s pro se brief confirms that there are no nonfrivolous issues that could be raised on appeal (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, lv denied 67 NY2d 650; see generally People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633). Therefore, the judgment should be affirmed and defense counsel’s application for leave to withdraw granted.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), rendered June 15, 2006, which resentenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
When this case was previously before us, we vacated defendant’s sentence and remitted the matter to County Court for resentencing with the instruction that the court must conduct an inquiry regarding whether there was a legitimate basis for defendant’s postplea arrests before it could impose a sentence greater than that contemplated by the plea agreement (29 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2006]). Upon remittal, the court held a hearing, after which it concluded that there was, indeed, a legitimate basis for two of defendant’s arrests. As such, the court imposed an enhanced sentence of 472 years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals and we now affirm.
County Court conducted a hearing relative to defendant’s postplea arrests wherein testimony was given by an alleged victim in one of the matters and an eyewitness in the other matter regarding circumstances underlying the arrests. Defendant was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and make any statements that he deemed pertinent. Having reviewed the hearing transcript, we are satisfied that County Court complied with the mandates set forth in both People v Outley (80 NY2d 702 [1993]) and our prior decision (29 AD3d 1177 [2006], supra), and properly determined that there was a legitimate basis for the arrests.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered August 15, 2013, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and attempted unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree.
In full satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree. The charge in question stemmed from defendant’s unlawful possession of methamphetamine on or about September 10, 2012. Defendant also waived indictment and, in satisfaction of a superior court information, pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of attempted unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree stemming from an incident that occurred on or about March 14, 2013. Consistent with the terms of the underlying plea agreement, which included a waiver of the right to appeal, County Court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender to an aggregate prison term of nine years followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, contending only that the waiver of the right to appeal was invalid and that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive.
We affirm. Initially, the People concede — and our review of the record confirms — “that defendant did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive her right to appeal her conviction and sentence” (People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d 1462, 1463 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1042 [2014]; see People v Larose, 120 AD3d 1442, 1442 n [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 1045 [2014]). As a result, defendant is not precluded from challenging the perceived severity of her sentence (see People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d at 1463). That said, upon reviewing the record as a whole and taking into account defendant’s lengthy criminal history, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in imposing sentence, nor do we find any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of defendant’s sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Cloutier, 120 AD3d at 1463; People v Howard, 111 AD3d 1021, 1021-1022 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1199 [2014]; People v Ladieu, 105 AD3d 1265, 1266 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1017 [2013]).

While incarcerated awaiting trial on an unrelated crime, a sealed indictment was handed up against defendant charging him with, inter alia, three separate drug sales to undercover law enforcement personnel. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of this indictment. We have examined defendant’s numerous contentions on appeal, including his claims that the counts of the indictment should have been severed and that his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial were abridged, and find them to be without merit.

In satisfaction of two indictments charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. He was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of three years to life and seven years to life. Contrary to defendant’s claim, we do not find that the sentence is harsh or excessive. Defendant was charged with a number of drug-related crimes as the result of his involvement in drug-trafficking activities which were discovered by undercover police officers. Many of these crimes were dismissed as part of the plea bargain, which was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered into by defendant. In view of this and the fact that the sentence imposed was also agreed to as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb County Court’s judgment.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Hoye, J.), rendered January 21, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, both class B felonies. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class C felony (see Penal Law § 110.05 [4]), in full satisfaction of the indictment. As part of the plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and executed a written waiver to that effect. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of incarceration of 3 to 6 years. He now appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the plea allocution is precluded by his waiver of the right to appeal, as well as by his failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Kelly, 3 AD3d 789, 789 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 801 [2004]; People v Kalenak, 2 AD3d 902, 902 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 629 [2004]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable because defendant made no statements during the plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666-667 [1988]; People v Kelly, supra at 789; People v Kalenak, supra at 902; People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]). Defendant’s claim that County Court’s allocution was inadequate because defendant provided little more than “yes” or “no” responses is without merit. The record shows that defendant’s affirmative responses to County Court’s questions established the elements of the crime to which defendant pleaded guilty (see People v Goodell, 13 AD3d 816, 817 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 831 [2005]; People v Kemp, supra at 636).
Defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney’s overall poof performance is foreclosed by his waiver of the right to appeal inasmuch as the ineffectiveness alleged does not bear upon the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 803 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004]; People v Watkins, 304 AD2d 987, 987-988 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 588 [2003]). In any event, defendant “receive [d] an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; see People v Wright, 295 AD2d 806, 807 [2002]). Defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence is likewise barred by his voluntary waiver of appeal, and we find no basis on this record to conclude that said waiver should not be honored (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803 [2004]).

Defendant’s only contention is that his 2 to 6-year prison sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced. We disagree. Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. In addition, defendant derived a substantial benefit from this plea as the People agreed not to pursue another charge which could have been filed against him in this matter. Finally, this sentence was within the statutory parameters and not the harshest one possible.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered June 9, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in the third degree. During the trial on these charges, defense counsel informed County Court that he had just been provided with certain letters written by defendant to an individual who was present when defendant was arrested and that one of the letters contained “very, very damning statements and admissions by [defendant].” Defense counsel further informed County Court that, on account of this new evidence, he had advised defendant that he should accept the plea agreement offer that had been presented to him prior to trial. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty as charged and waived his right to appeal. County Court subsequently sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of eight years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal, that his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, survives his waiver of the right to appeal, but is unpreserved for our review in light of his failure to move to make an appropriate postal-locution motion (see People v Laflower, 145 AD3d 1341, 1342 [2016]; People v Taylor, 144 AD3d 1317, 1318 [2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 1151 [2017]). Although defendant sent County Court a letter seeking a mistrial and to vacate his plea, County Court rejected it three weeks prior to sentencing, informing him that the letter did not constitute a proper motion to withdraw his plea, as it contained no sworn allegations of fact, no citation to case law supporting his request and that it was not served on the People or defense counsel. At sentencing, County Court reiterated that defendant’s letter did not constitute a motion to withdraw his plea. When given an opportunity to address County Court prior to sentencing, defendant did not make any further request to withdraw his plea and did not offer an affidavit or any other evidence in support of the issues raised in his letter. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea is not preserved for our review. Moreover, defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution so as to trigger the narrow exception to the preservation rule (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Otsego County (Burns, J.), rendered June 14, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a two-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and purportedly waived his right to appeal. The plea agreement contemplated that defendant would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 4V2 years in prison to be followed by two years of postrelease supervision. County Court imposed that sentence, and defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s contention that the motion practice and discovery efforts of defense counsel amounted to ineffective assistance was “forfeited by his guilty plea, as a defendant who enters a plea and admits guilt ‘may not later seek review of claims relating to the deprivation of rights that took place before the plea was entered’ ” (People v Trombley, 91 AD3d 1197, 1201 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 914 [2013], quoting People v Hansen, 95 NY2d 227, 230 [2000]). Defendant further asserts that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender, inasmuch as he was deprived of the opportunity to contest the allegations contained in the prior felony information as required by CPL 400.21 (3). This claim is unpreserved for our review given defendant’s failure to object at sentencing (see People v House, 119 AD3d 1289, 1290 [2014]; People v Morse, 111 AD3d 1161, 1161 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1040 [2014]). In any event, because a second felony offender statement was filed by the People and defendant was well aware that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender when he entered his guilty plea, we find that there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21 (see People v Bouyea, 64 NY2d 1140, 1142 [1985]; People v Chrysler, 260 AD2d 945, 945-946 [1999]; People v Mann, 258 AD2d 738, 739 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 900 [1999]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (Richards, J.), rendered April 11, 2016, which resen-tenced defendant following his conviction of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
The underlying facts are more fully set forth in our prior decision in this matter (134 AD3d 1353 [2015]). Briefly, defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in this third degree (two counts) with the understanding that he would enter a judicial diversion program and faced up to 24 years in prison if he did not complete it. Defendant was charged with violating the terms and conditions of the program, and then admitted that he had done so. Defendant did so with the understanding that he would be sentenced, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate prison term of seven years to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision.
Upon appeal, defendant argued that his prior felony conviction in New Hampshire was not the equivalent of a felony in New York and that he should not have been adjudicated as a second felony offender. This Court found that defendant’s argument on this point was unpreserved and affirmed the judgment of conviction (id. at 1354). Defendant then successfully moved to set aside his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20. County Court resentenced him, as a felony drug offender, to an aggregate prison term of five years followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to be served under parole supervision pursuant to CPL 410.91 (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [d]). Defendant now appeals.
Defendant’s claim that the resentence imposed is harsh and excessive is predicated in large measure upon the fact that the original sentence of seven years in prison was one year more than the minimum term allowed for a second felony drug offender in his position (see Penal Law §§ 70.70 [4] [b] [i]; 220.39 [1]). He reasons that he should have been resentenced to an aggregate prison term of two years, the minimum allowable term plus one year, and that any period of incarceration in excess of two years is harsh and excessive (see Penal Law § 70.70 [2] [a] [i]).
We disagree. After considering the pertinent factors, including defendant’s positive program accomplishments while confined and his criminal history, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in resentencing defendant in the middle of the permissible sentencing range or that defendant has presented any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Smith, 135 AD3d 1248, 1248-1249 [2016]; People v Cruz, 131 AD3d 724, 728 [2015], lv denied 26 NY3d 1087 [2015]).

"—Mahoney, J.
Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered November 9, 1990, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a con trolled substance in the third degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered November 9, 1990, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was the subject of two separate indictments dated December 11, 1989 charging him with, inter alia, various counts of criminal possession and sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The first indictment, No. 136-89, was against defendant alone; the second, No. 134-89, was against defendant and another and proceeded upon an acting in concert or accomplice theory. Following a jury trial on the first indictment, defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On the day sentencing was scheduled to occur relative to that conviction, defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the charges contained in the second indictment. As part of his plea agreement, defendant expressly waived his rights to appeal from the convictions arising from both indictments. He subsequently was sentenced on both convictions to concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 6 to 18 years. Claiming errors in the denial of certain pretrial motions in connection with both indictments, alleged proof defects in the trial of the first indictment and asserting that the sentences imposed were excessive, defendant now appeals.
In our view, defendant’s express waiver of the right to appeal both judgments of conviction is valid and enforceable and precludes our consideration of most of the arguments advanced. It is now well settled that a defendant ordinarily may waive his or her right to appeal as part of a negotiated plea as long as the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1). While the waiver in this case is slightly different from most in that defendant waived appellate review not only of the guilty plea conviction but also of his prior jury trial conviction, in view of the announced lack of “affirmative public policy to be served in fostering appeals or prohibiting their waiver” (People v Seaberg, supra, at 8) combined with the strong public policy of encouraging “a prompt resolution of criminal proceedings with all the benefits that enure from final disposition” (supra, at 7), we see nothing offensive, constitutionally, statutorily or policywise, in permitting a defendant to waive rights to appeal in more than one conviction as part of a negotiated plea in situations such as this where the criminal proceedings are so closely connected.
Nor is there any merit to defendant’s claim that the waiver of his rights to appeal were not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made or that the waiver was unreasonable or inappropriate under the circumstances. Defendant was 29 years old at the time of the plea, articulate and no stranger to the criminal justice system. A review of the record reveals that County Court informed defendant twice that one of the consequences of his plea would be waiver of his right to appeal both the guilty plea conviction and the jury trial conviction, stating at one point prior to taking the plea, ""Of course you realize that this will be a final sentence in terms of your waiving your right to appeal? You will not be able to appeal the judgments of this court in connection with both Indictment 134-89 and 136-89.” When asked if he understood these terms, defendant responded, ""Yeah”, and the following colloquy ensued:
""the court: So is everything out in the open?
""defendant: Uh-hum.
""the court: Uh-hum means yes?
""defendant: Yes.
""the court: No hidden or secret agreements?
""defendant: Nope.”
Moreover, upon review, we are satisfied that defendant’s relinquishment of his rights to appeal both convictions was neither unfair nor oppressive. Significantly, there is absolutely no hint that defining the scope of the right to appeal waiver to include the prior jury trial conviction was designed to conceal error or misconduct which occurred during that trial. This is confirmed by our review of the trial transcript. Rather, it is apparent from a reading of defendant’s comments during the pre-plea discussion that the plea was the direct result of defendant’s knowledge that the same evidence used against him in the trial on the first indictment would be used in the trial on the second and his desire to minimize his jail time by obtaining concurrent sentences.
Finally, while cognizant that certain appellate arguments can be reviewed despite the existence of an enforceable, bargained-for waiver of the right to appeal (see, e.g., People v Callahan, supra; People v Seaberg, supra; cf., People v Gerber, 182 AD2d 252, lv denied 80 NY2d 1026), defendant’s arguments regarding whether certain of the jury’s findings accorded with the weight of the evidence and whether the court abused its discretion in imposing the sentences do not fall within that category (see, People v Callahan, supra; People v Baker, 195 AD2d 700). While it is not clear from a reading of the record whether defendant was informed that waiver of the right to appeal included pretrial proceedings (compare, People v Darling, 183 AD2d 950, lv denied 80 NY2d 902), we have reviewed defendant’s contentions in this regard (namely, that denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss both indictments for failure to comply with CPL 190.50 [5] [a] was erroneous as was denial of his motion for sanctions for the prosecution’s alleged nondisclosure), and find them to be without merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Drago, J.), rendered November 29, 2005, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
Defendant proceeded to trial on a four-count indictment. During jury selection, a prospective juror sent a letter to County Court stating that he was actively running a business and asked to be exempt from jury duty. When the prospective juror was questioned, he explained that during the first day of jury selection his business had a problem, and his efforts to resolve the problem caused him to get little sleep that night. The court asked if he could put someone else in charge, to which he replied, “I will try, but it’s really difficult.” He stated that it would be hard for him to sit on the jury, but it would not be impossible, and indicated that he was not trying to shirk his civic duty. Defense counsel unsuccessfully challenged the juror for cause, then elected to use a peremptory challenge. Following trial, the jury convicted defendant of all counts. He now appeals.
County Court appropriately exercised its discretion in denying defendant’s challenge for cause. A defendant may challenge for cause a prospective juror who “has a state of mind that is likely to preclude him [or her] from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial” (CPL 270.20 [1] [b]). Slight interference with employment or inconvenience related to sitting on a jury are insufficient grounds to support a challenge for cause (see People v Ciochenda, 17 AD3d 248, 248 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 760 [2005]; People v Willard, 226 AD2d 1014, 1017-1018 [1996], appeal dismissed 88 NY2d 943 [1996]; People v Dunkley, 189 AD2d 776, 777 [1993], lv denied 81 NY2d 884 [1993]; cf. People v Bunch, 278 AD2d 501, 502 [2000]; Matter of Robles v Bamberger, 219 AD2d 243, 246-247 [1996], appeal dismissed 88 NY2d 962 [1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 809 [1996]; People v Nocedo, 161 AD2d 297, 298 [1990]). Moreover, absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not disturb a trial court’s determination concerning whether a prospective juror can sit in a particular case (see People v Busreth, 35 AD3d 965, 966-967 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 920 [2007]).
Here, although the juror expressed his inconvenience and inability to run his business efficiently while he was on jury duty, he reassured County Court that he placed a high value on jury service and that he would serve if chosen. Considering that almost every potential juror is inconvenienced by taking a week or more away from one’s work or normal routine, and that each has personal concerns which could cause some distraction from a trial, County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s challenge for cause (see People v Michael, 48 NY2d 1, 10 [1979]; see also Matter of Colcloughley v Johnson, 115 AD2d 58, 62 [1986], lv denied 68 NY2d 604 [1986]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered September 16, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
Defendant was charged with five counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to the agreed-upon term of three years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
Preliminarily, to the extent that defendant suggests that his plea was coerced, we need note only that defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction and, hence, has not preserved this issue for our review (see People v Brown, 49 AD3d 1028 [2008]; People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1005 [2007]). The narrow exception to the preservation requirement has not been triggered here as defendant did not make any statements during the plea allocution that cast doubt upon either his guilt or the voluntariness of his plea or otherwise tended to negate a material element of the crime (see People v Hall, 41 AD3d 1090, 1091 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 876 [2007]; People v Williams, 25 AD3d 927, 929 [2006], lv denied 6 NY3d 840 [2006]). In any event, were we to reach this issue, we would find it to be lacking in merit.
Turning to the issue of sentencing, although defendant indeed preserved his challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed, we find it to be unpersuasive. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and, in light of his criminal history, we perceive no abuse of discretion nor are we able to discern the existence of any extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Edwards, 43 AD3d at 1228; People v Hilliard, 39 AD3d 1021, 1022 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered April 1, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a 10-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 3Vs to 10 years. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved pro se to withdraw his guilty plea alleging that it was rendered involuntary by defense counsel’s coercion and various defects in the plea allocution. County Court denied the motion following a hearing and ultimately imposed the agreed-upon sentence. Defendant appeals.
Initially, defendant’s failure to recite sufficient facts to establish each and every element of the pleaded to crimes during the allocution does not require invalidation of the plea, particularly since defendant admitted to all of the factual allegations underlying the crimes after they were recited by County Court and made no statement which tended to negate an essential element of the crimes (see, People v Beuther, 236 AD2d 661, lv denied 89 NY2d 1032). Moreover, our review of the record reveals no support for the proposition that defendant’s plea was rendered involuntary by defense counsel’s conduct or the lack of adequate time to consider the plea offer (see, People v Mingues, 256 AD2d 657). Rather, we find that defendant’s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. County Court provided a detailed explanation of the consequences of the plea and in response thereto defendant indicated that he understood the court’s instructions, was not pressured or coerced into accepting the plea offer and wished to plead guilty despite his dissatisfaction with counsel’s inability to negotiate a more lenient sentence (see, People v Fernandez, 263 AD2d 673; People v Tyler, 260 AD2d 796, lv denied 93 NY2d 980).
Finally, based upon defendant’s open acknowledgment of guilt during the plea allocution and our review of the transcript of the hearing conducted by County Court, we perceive no reason to disturb the order denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea (see, People v Gibson, 261 AD2d 710).
Defendant’s remaining contentions have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered August 4, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Defendant was charged in a nine-count indictment with various drug-related offenses, as well as criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, menacing in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child (two counts), stemming from an incident wherein defendant threatened his then paramour with a gun in front of their two children. The initial prosecution ended in a mistrial, and defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and an outstanding parole violation. Defendant waived his right to appeal in writing, which he affirmed during the plea colloquy, and was sentenced, as an admitted second felony offender, to the promised prison term of 2 to 4 years.
We affirm. Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea, although not encompassed by his waiver of the right to ap peal, nonetheless is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not move to withdraw his plea or vacate the underlying judgment of conviction (see People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d 643 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 759 [2006]; People v Robetoy, 21 AD3d 1220 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 758 [2005]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]). Defendant also, however, challenges the voluntariness of his appeal waiver, and we no longer apply preservation principles to such a challenge (see People v Lewis, 48 AD3d 880 [2008]). Thus, we will review defendant’s challenge to the plea in the interest of justice in conjunction with our review of the voluntariness of the appeal waiver. Indeed, a review of the record does not support defendant’s claims that his plea and accompanying waiver were coerced or that he was not informed of the sentence he would be facing (see People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10-11 [1989]; People v Lewis, 48 AD3d at 881; People v Wyant, 47 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2008]). Defendant unequivocally stated that he had not been threatened or otherwise forced to plead guilty or to waive his right to appeal, and the proposed sentence was plainly and repeatedly disclosed to defendant prior to entering his plea.
As to defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, his “failure to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction serves as a bar to this challenge as well” (People v McEnteggart, 26 AD3d at 643; see People v Parara, 46 AD3d 936, 937 [2007]). In any event, we find this claim to be unpersuasive. Defendant was represented by three attorneys at the plea allocution who, in addition to securing a very advantageous plea for him, extensively addressed his concerns regarding his related parole violation and his desire to visit with his children while in prison. Defendant not only indicated that he was satisfied with the representation provided but expressed his appreciation for “all the work” counsel had done for him. Simply put, there is nothing in the record to suggest that counsels’ representation was less than meaningful (see People v Parara, 46 AD3d at 937). Finally, defendant’s challenge to the agreed-upon sentence is precluded in light of his valid waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Tedesco, 38 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 991 [2007]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tioga County (Sgueglia, J.), rendered October 3, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant waived indictment and agreed to be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to this charge and, in accordance with the plea agreement, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison. He now appeals.
Defendant’s sole argument is that the sentence imposed by County Court is harsh and excessive. Although defendant relies upon a number of cases in which the sentences of defendants who were convicted of the same crime were reduced to a prison term shorter than his, these cases do not establish that defendant’s sentence was excessive under the particular circumstances presented here. The presentence investigation report reveals that defendant has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1981 and has previously served state prison time. He was heavily involved in drug trafficking at the time of committing the crime at issue and was found to be in possession of $13,000 as the result of his drug sales. In view of this, and the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence as part of the plea agreement, we find no extraordinary circumstances or any abuse of discretion warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see e.g. People v Hodges, 13 AD3d 979, 980 [2004]; People v Jones, 295 AD2d 699 [2002]; People v Ruffo, 161 AD2d 894, 895 [1990], lv denied 76 NY2d 864 [1990]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered July 6, 1999, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of at tempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. ""
After defendant sold cocaine to a police informant on two occasions in May 1998, his residence was searched pursuant to a warrant and, as a result of the search, defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of .criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced to 330 days in the Chemung County Jail. Defendant was thereafter indicted on two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and ultimately entered a plea of guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment. After denying defendant’s request to withdraw his plea, County Court sentenced him as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years in accordance with the plea bargain.
On this appeal from the felony conviction, defendant claims that the offenses charged in the indictment and the prior drug possession offense were joinable in a single indictment pursuant to CPL 200.20 (2) (c) and that the prosecution abused its discretion by prosecuting them separately. Assuming that the claim has been preserved for our review, it has- no merit. Inasmuch as the crimes were not based on the same criminal transaction, the mandatory joinder provisions of CPL 40.40 were inapplicable and, therefore, defendant had no reason to believe that, after his plea to the possession crime, the People would forgo prosecution of the separate and distinct crimes based upon the drug sales. Defendant’s speculation that a single indictment charging him with all three crimes “would probably have been resolved with a negotiated plea to a single count in satisfaction of the entire instrument” is insufficient to create a new category of mandatory joinder, which would be the effect of accepting defendant’s claim.
Defendant’s request to withdraw his plea was based upon his desire to take advantage of parole supervision in an intensive drug treatment program as authorized by CPL 410.91. In denying the request, County Court explained that the program was only available to those convicted of class D or E felonies and that, in light of defendant’s criminal history, the court would not agree to reduce the charges in the indictment below that of the class C felony to which defendant had entered his plea. In these circumstances, County Court did not err in denying defendant’s request. Finally, the record on this direct appeal does not support defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered March 15, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (three counts).
Defendant challenges the severity of the sentence imposed upon him as a second felony offender following his plea of guilty of three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. A sentence of 6 to 12 years was imposed on each of the drug sale counts and a one-year sentence was imposed on each of the drug possession counts, with all sentences to run concurrently. Considering defendant’s lengthy criminal history, which consists primarily of assaultive behavior and substance abuse, and the absence of any extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification in the interest of justice, we find no basis to disturb the sentence, which is well within the permissible statutory range (see, People v Carter, 267 AD2d 594, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; People v Cooper, 258 AD2d 815, 816, lv denied 93 NY2d 1016).

Given the testimony of the undercover officer and the informant, as well as the corroborating testimony from the backup surveillance investigators, we agree with County Court’s conclusion that the People demonstrated that defendant was not acting as an agent (see, People v Williams, 132 AD2d 892). Therefore, defendant’s contention that the court’s decision was against the weight of the evidence is rejected (see, supra). Furthermore, we reject defendant’s contention that the prison sentence of 6 to 12 years as a second felony offender was harsh and excessive. In view of his criminal record and the fact that the sentence was well within the statutory guidelines, we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by the court (see, People v Lipinski, 159 AD2d 860, lv denied 76 NY2d 860; People v Hoag, 94 AD2d 921).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Cawley Jr., J), rendered May 28, 2008, convict ing defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and, pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, was sentenced to a prison term of six years with three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant further requested that County Court order his enrollment in the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program (see Penal Law § 60.04 [6]). County Court declined to do so and defendant appeals.
We affirm. As defendant was convicted of a controlled substance offense, County Court was permitted to order defendant’s enrollment in the comprehensive alcohol and substance abuse treatment program as a matter of discretion (see Penal Law § 60.04 [6]; see e.g. People v Wade, 51 AD3d 601, 601 [2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 742 [2008]; People v Edell, 45 AD3d 461, 461 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1033 [2008]).

Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), entered January 25, 2005, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence following his conviction of two counts of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing.
Previously, this Court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, following a jury trial, of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentencing him as a persistent felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 16 years to life (232 AD2d 811 [1996], lv denied 89 NY2d 943 [1997]). Defendant now appeals from County Court’s denial, in a written decision, of his CPL 440.20 motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that New York’s persistent felony sentencing scheme violates his rights under the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution, relying on Apprendi v New Jersey (530 US 466 [2000]). We disagree and affirm.
Defendant argued in his pro se motion to set aside his sentence that his constitutional rights were infringed upon because a judge, rather than a jury, determined whether he would receive an enhanced sentence under the persistent felony offender statutes (see Penal Law § 70.10; see also CPL 400.20). County Court properly rejected that contention (see People v Rivera, 5 NY3d 61, 66 [2005], cert denied — US —, 126 S Ct 564 [2005]; People v Rosen, 96 NY2d 329, 334-335 [2001], cert denied 534 US 899 [2001]; People v Pelkey, 27 AD3d 785, 785 [2006]; People v Bingham, 24 AD3d 1016, 1017 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 831 [2006]; People v Conger, 19 AD3d 938, 939 [2005], lv denied 5 NY3d 827 [2005]).
Defendant now also argues, for the first time on this appeal, that CPL 400.20 was unconstitutional and unconstitutionally applied at the time of his 1993 sentencing and remained so until it was clarified or “cured” in 2001 by the Court of Appeals in People v Rosen (supra at 334-335), and later in People v Rivera (supra at 66). From that premise, defendant argues that he was sentenced in accordance with a then-constitutionally deficient statute, requiring that his sentence be vacated. Inasmuch as this issue was never raised in his CPL 440.20 motion or otherwise argued in County Court, it has not been preserved for our review (see People v Pelkey, supra; CPL 470.05 [2]) and we decline to address it in the interest of justice.

Defendant now appeals, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and harsh and excessive sentence.
We affirm. To the extent that defendant’s challenge to the effectiveness of counsel impacts upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, the claim survives the waiver of the right to appeal, but defendant’s failure to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction renders the issue unpreserved for our review (see People v Washington, 3 AD3d 741, 742 [2004], lv denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]). Even if we were to consider the claim, we would find it to be without merit. “ Tn the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he or she receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel’ ” (People v Scott, 12 AD3d 716, 717 [2004], quoting People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]). Here, defense counsel made the appropriate pretrial motions and negotiated a favorable plea agreement exposing defendant to far less prison time than if he were convicted of the charges after trial (see People v Washington, supra at 743). Finally, defendant’s challenge to the severity of his sentence will not be reviewed given his knowing, intelligent and voluntary plea and waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Travis, 12 AD3d 784 [2004]; People v Scott, supra at 718).

"Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the County Court, Rockland County (Edelstein, J.), imposed September 9, 1986, upon his conviction of criminal sale of marihuana in the first degree and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, after a plea of guilty, the sentence being two concurrent terms of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years.
Ordered that the sentence is affirmed, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Rockland County, for further proceedings pursuant to CPL 460.50 (5).
The County Court informed the defendant that it could not, in good conscience, impose the promised sentence due to the nature and extent of the crimes. The defendant was then offered the option of accepting the sentence actually imposed or withdrawing his guilty plea (see, People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, cert denied 419 US 1122). The court gave the defendant an adjournment for more than one week to consider this and to make a decision. On the adjourned date, the defendant expressly stated that he would not withdraw his plea of guilty and accepted the proposed sentence. The defendant had not so changed his position in reliance on the sentence promise that the withdrawal of his guilty plea would not have restored him to his original position (cf., People v McConnell, 49 NY2d 340; People v Danny G., 61 NY2d 169). Therefore, he is not entitled to specific performance of the sentence promise (see, People v Schultz, 133 AD2d 862 [decided herewith]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), rendered January 4, 1990, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of three counts of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant argues only that the concurrent prison sentences she received as a second felony offender of ZVz to 7 years upon her plea of guilty were harsh and excessive. However, she entered her plea knowing that she would receive the sentences ultimately imposed and the plea was to the reduced charges of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree instead of the three counts of actual sale as originally charged in the indictment. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that County Court abused its discretion when it imposed sentence on defendant (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered May 29, 2002, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree arid criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered February 5, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to vacate the sentence, without a hearing.
In 2001, defendant was charged in separate indictments with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. County Court consolidated the indictments, and defendant was released on bail with a Parker admonishment advising him of the consequences of failing to appear for trial. At 10:45 a.m. on March 25, 2002, the day of trial, defendant told counsel that he was going to get something to eat. and would meet him at the courthouse before noon, the time that trial was scheduled to begin. Defendant did not appear, trial was delayed until the next day, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. After attempts to reach defendant failed and an investigation revealed that defendant had informed a family member that he was not going to appear in court, County Court determined that defendant waived his right to be present. Following a jury trial conducted in absentia, defendant was found guilty as charged and sentenced—again in absentia inasmuch as defendant continued to secrete himself despite multiple adjournments and a diligent search for him by the Sheriffs Department and United States Marshals Service—to 12 to 36 years in prison.
Defendant next appeared more than six years later when he was arrested in November 2008 and remanded to the custody of the sheriff to serve his sentence. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to CPL 440.20, asserting that (1) the sentence was illegal under the subsequently enacted Rockefeller Drug Reform Act, (2) invalid because he never admitted that he knew of his trial date, and (3) harsh and excessive. County Court denied the motion without a hearing, and defendant appeals from the judgment and the denial of his CPL 440.20 motion.
Defendant’s apipeal from the May 29, 2002 judgment of conviction must be dismissed inasmuch as the appeal was not timely taken and there is no basis for an extension under the circumstances presented herein (see CPL 460.10 [1] [a]; 460.30 [1]; People v Torres, 179 AD2d 358 [1992]; People v Doyne, 178 AD2d 870, 871 [1991]; cf.

To the extent that defendant argues, in connection with his CPL 440.20 motion, that he was improperly sentenced in absentia, his argument is unsupported by the record. Defendant concedes that his sentence is otherwise legal, and his claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive may not be raised on a CPL 440.20 motion (see People v Boyce, 12 AD3d 728, 730 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 741 [2004]; People v Cunningham, 305 AD2d 516, 517 [2003]; see also People v Murphy, 37 AD3d 976, 977 [2007]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered May 17, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and was sentenced, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 1 to 3 years in prison. The plea was entered into in satisfaction of a superior court information charging him with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a crime which he committed while awaiting sentencing on another charge, the facts of which are more fully set forth in People v Douglas (2 AD3d 1050 [2003] [decided herewith]). Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant committed the crime in violation of the no-arrest condition of a prior plea bargain. Given these circumstances, as well as the fact that defendant agreed to the sentence challenged on this appeal as part of a plea bargain, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Samuel, 284 AD2d 654, 655 [2001]; People v Hicks, 265 AD2d 600, 601 [1999]).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered August 31, 2006, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Satisfying a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. County Court deferred sentencing so that defendant could participate in a drug treatment court program, with the proviso that, in the event that he was unsuccessfully discharged from the program, he could be sentenced to up to eight years in prison and three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was thereafter indicted for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Based upon this new indictment, defendant was charged with violating his drug treatment court program agreement. After being advised by County Court that he would be sentenced to a 10-year term of imprisonment, defendant resolved the new indictment by pleading guilty to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and also admitted to violating the terms of his participation in the drug treatment court program. As a consequence, County Court sentenced defendant to consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment, with an aggregate of three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. Defendant’s claim that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary is belied by the record. Accordingly, given defendant’s valid appeal waiver, he is precluded from arguing that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Nickell, 49 AD3d 1024, 1025 [2008]; People v Romano, 45 AD3d 910, 912 [2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 770 [2008]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Eidens, J.), rendered June 6, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Defendant’s plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree was entered in full satisfaction of a multiple count indictment alleging sale of heroin to an undercover officer. As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal and the People agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 2 to 6 years with diversion to a drug treatment program. Despite a Parker admonition, defendant abandoned the residential drug program and failed to appear for sentencing. Defendant was sentenced in absentia to the promised period of imprisonment. Defendant appeals, contending that his plea was not voluntary, that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel and that the sentence was excessive.
We affirm. Inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or otherwise vacate the judgment of conviction, any attack on the voluntariness of the plea is unpreserved (see People v De Berardinis, 304 AD2d 914, 915 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 580 [2003]; People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]; People v Camp, 302 AD2d 629, 630 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 593 [2003]; People v Teague, 295 AD2d 813, 814 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 772 [2002]). Were we to reach defendant’s argument concerning the entry of his plea, we would find it unpersuasive since the record clearly supports the conclusion that the plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see People v Smith, 305 AD2d 853, 854 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 624 [2003]; People v Sampson, 301 AD2d 677 [2003]; People v Keyes, 300 AD2d 909, 909-910 [2002]; People v Fulford, 296 AD2d 661, 662 [2002]).
Next, many of the alleged failings defendant points to as supporting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relate to sentencing, not to the voluntariness of the plea, and are precluded by his waiver of appeal (see People v De Berardinis, supra at 915; People v Camp, supra at 630). Further, failure of defendant’s attorney to persuade County Court to impose a lighter sentence (particularly in view of defendant’s abandonment of the drug treatment program and his disappearance prior to sentencing) does not constitute ineffectiveness (see People v Smith [Jones] [Tree], 300 AD2d 745, 746 [2002], lvs denied 99 NY2d 616, 620 [2003]).
Finally, any challenge to the sentence as excessive is precluded by defendant’s waiver of appeal (see People v Rea, 305 AD2d 802 [2003]). He waived his right to be considered for youthful offender treatment by failing to request it and, given the totality of defendant’s conduct, no basis exists upon which to exercise our interest of justice powers to consider the issue now (see People v McGowen, 42 NY2d 905, 906 [1977]; People v Richardson [Cheeks], 295 AD2d 704, 704 [2002], lvs denied 98 NY2d 709, 713 [2002]; People v Chaplin, 178 AD2d 685 [1991], lv denied 79 NY2d 945 [1992]).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Hayden, J.), rendered January 28, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal contempt in the first degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered September 1, 2000, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
Defendant was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree after he sold cocaine in the City of Elmira, Chemung County, on April 15, 1999. Following a May 1999 incident in which he violated a protective order, he was charged in a second indictment with two counts of criminal contempt in the first degree. In satisfaction of both indictments, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal contempt in the first degree. Under the terms of the plea agreement, he was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to concurrent prison terms of 4V2 to 9 years on the criminal sale conviction and 2 to 4 years on the contempt conviction. Thereafter, he moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction. County Court denied the motion without a hearing, resulting in these appeals.
Defendant’s sole contention is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Initially, we note that “ ‘[t]he imposition of the sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we should not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances’ ” (People v King, 293 AD2d 815, 817-818 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 698 [2002], quoting People v Harris, 57 AD2d 663 [1977]; see People v Roberts, 301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]). Based upon our review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances. Given defendant’s status as a second felony offender, he was potentially subject to a maximum 12½ to 25-year prison term on the criminal sale conviction (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and a maximum two- to four-year prison term on the criminal contempt conviction (see Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [e]; [4] [b]). Because each conviction arose out of separate incidents, County Court could also have imposed consecutive prison terms (see People v Smith, 309 AD2d 1081, 1083 [2003]; People v Shook, 294 AD2d 710, 713-714 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 702 [2002]), resulting in a prison term of 14½ to 29 years. In addition, the presentence investigation report reveals that defendant has a lengthy criminal history, including many drug-related crimes. In view of this, as well as the fact that he agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain, we find no reason to disturb it.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered August 20, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree.
Defendant and another individual were indicted and charged with criminal sale of marihuana in the second degree arising from the sale of marihuana to a confidential informant. Defendant, after conferring with counsel, agreed to plead guilty and, in exchange, defendant was promised a sentence of no more than six months in jail and a five-year period of probation. Defendant also agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a written waiver. Defendant acknowledged that he understood that he was giving up certain rights associated with a jury trial and then stated that he “was an accomplice to a third party” who sold marihuana to another person, and that the marihuana weighed more than four ounces. Thereafter, County Court sentenced him to a four-month jail term and a five-year period of probation. He now appeals.
Defendant’s challenge to the voluntariness of the plea, while not encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal, is not preserved for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v MacCue, 8 AD3d 910, 911 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]; People v Ward, 2 AD3d 1219, 1219 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 808 [2004]). The exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable as defendant did not make any statements that were inconsistent with his guilt such as to negate an essential element of the crime (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Ward, supra at 1219). In any event, were we to consider defendant’s argument, we would find it to be without merit as “defendant’s affirmative responses to County Court’s questions established the elements of the crime[ ] charged and there is no indication in the record that the voluntary plea was baseless or improvident” (People v Kemp, 288 AD2d 635, 636 [2001]; see People v Baker, 301 AD2d 868, 869 [2003], lv dismissed 99 NY2d 625 [2003]).
Given the knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and waiver of the right to appeal, we will not review defendant’s contention that his sentence was harsh and excessive (see People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]; People v Hughes, 3 AD3d 736, 737 [2004]).

"from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County, rendered April 4, 1975, convicting defendant on his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Defendant’s sole contentions on this appeal are that his sentence is unduly harsh and excessive and that the laws under which it was pronounced are unconstitutional. The record reveals that defendant was advised at the time he entered his plea of guilty that the District Attorney would recommend that a minimum three-year term of imprisonment be imposed upon him at the time of sentence. A minimum sentence of eight years and four months of imprisonment for the crime of which he was convicted was authorized (Penal Law, § 220.39; 70.00 subd 3, par [a], cl [iii]). When that recommendation was in fact made, defense counsel asked that it be followed. Furthermore, it appears that the instant guilty plea was accepted in satisfaction of other unspecified charges. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the minimum term of imprisonment selected by the sentencing court constituted an abuse of discretion. The maximum term of life imprisonment imposed herein was mandated by statute (Penal Law, § 70.00 subd 2, par [a]), and has previously withstood the same type of constitutional attack as defendant now urges upon us (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Cortland County (Ames, J.), rendered October 1, 2013, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of conspiracy in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Following an investigation by the Attorney General’s Statewide Organized Crime Task Force, defendant and George Macon were charged in a superceding indictment with conspiracy in the fourth degree and other drug-related felonies stemming from the distribution of cocaine in 2012. Following extensive negotiations, defendant accepted a plea agreement pursuant to which he waived his right to appeal and pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the fourth degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under counts 1 and 3 of the indictment, respectively, in satisfaction of all charges. He was sentenced, consistent with the plea agreement, to time served on each of the convictions, approximately one year in jail, to be served concurrently. Defendant appeals.
We affirm. Defendant challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea, a claim that survives his uncontested waiver of the right to appeal but which is not preserved for this Court’s review given his failure to make an appropriate postallocution motion (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Hudson, 130 AD3d 1320, 1320 [2015]; People v Guyette, 121 AD3d 1430, 1431 [2014]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation rule is inapplicable here, as defendant did not make any statements during his ultimate plea allocution that were inconsistent with his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness of his plea (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Hare, 110 AD3d 1117, 1117 [2013]). Although County Court’s initial attempts to complete a plea allocution were halted due to defendant’s reluctance to implicate Macon or to admit certain overt acts alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy, after two adjournments, defense counsel assured the court that defendant “understands his rights.” Defendant thereafter allocuted, without qualification, to the conspiracy charge, including sufficient overt acts, and also admitted to the possession charge and, during both allocutions, made no statements suggestive of innocence or involuntariness. Further, prior to eliciting and accepting his guilty plea, the court adequately informed defendant of the trial-related rights that he was forfeiting as a consequence of the guilty plea, including “the privilege against self-incrimination and the rights to a jury trial and to be confronted by witnesses” (People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 365 [2013], citing Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]). As such, there is an “affirmative showing on the record that the defendant waived his constitutional rights” (People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d at 365 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).
With regard to defendant’s specific claim that his plea was involuntary in that his factual admissions (although not his actual guilty plea) preceded County Court’s advisement of the rights he would be forfeiting in connection with his guilty plea, we reiterate that it is the better practice to advise a pleading defendant of such rights “prior to obtaining an admission to the charges and a plea of guilty” (People v Mandiville, 84 AD3d 1644, 1645 n [2011]). We note that the Court of Appeals has held that, with regard to a trial court’s failure to properly inform a defendant of the trial-related rights forfeited by a guilty plea, preservation is required “depending upon the particular circumstances of a case” (People v Conceicao, 26 NY3d 375, 382 [2015]). Here, defendant failed to preserve this issue by making a postallocution motion to withdraw his plea, despite the opportunity to do so in the months following his guilty plea and before sentencing (see id.). Given that defendant was advised of his trial-related rights during two arraign ments and only entered a guilty plea after he was fully advised of the rights that he was forgoing by his plea, we decline to take corrective action in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6]). Defendant’s remaining claims have been reviewed and determined to lack merit.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Breslin, J.), rendered April 22, 2005, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement which included the waiver of the right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. While County Court informed defendant of the permissible range of sentencing which could be imposed, it instructed defendant that it was making no sentencing commitment. Defendant’s subsequent motion to withdraw his plea was denied and he was sentenced as a second felony offender in accordance with the plea agreement to a prison term of S1/* to 6V2 years. Defendant’s sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. Inasmuch as the record establishes that defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and valid waiver of the right to appeal, and was apprised of the maximum permissible sentence, he is precluded from challenging the severity of the sentence imposed (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Foster, 23 AD3d 839 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 812 [2006]; People v Clow, 10 AD3d 803, 804 [2004]).

"Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to 41/2 to 9 years in prison. On appeal, he argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We find defendant’s first contention to be without merit. Although defendant had difficulty deciding whether to plead guilty or to proceed to trial, he was fully informed of the ramifications of pleading guilty and communicated his understanding to County Court prior to entering his plea. Consequently, we find that his plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 16-17; People v Machado, 181 AD2d 796, lv denied 79 NY2d 1051).
Since defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea, he waived his right to raise other issues on appeal, including his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel (see, People v Rosado, 221 AD2d 777; People v Bryant, 221 AD2d 774). Nevertheless, were we to consider this claim, we would find that it is also without merit. Although three different attorneys from the Public Defender’s office appeared on defendant’s behalf, each attorney represented defendant competently. Therefore, we find that defendant was provided meaningful representation (see, People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; People v Jimenez, 189 AD2d 990, lv denied 81 NY2d 972).

"Lahtinen, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County (Herrick, J.), rendered April 11, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived his right to appeal. Defendant was subsequently sentenced, as a predicate felon, in accordance with the plea agreement to a term of imprisonment of 6 to 12 years, with the sentence to run concurrent to a previously imposed sentence on another conviction. Defendant now appeals.
As an initial matter, we are not satisfied that defendant validly waived his right to appeal so we have reviewed the merits of defendant’s contentions that his plea was involuntary, he received ineffective assistance of counsel and his sentence was harsh and excessive.
As defendant acknowledged during the plea colloquy that he understood the ramifications of his guilty plea and freely admitted to facts which established the elements of the crime, his plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see People v Means, 35 AD3d 975, 976 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 948 [2007]). Defendant’s argument that, on the basis of his claims of innocence contained in the presentence report, counsel’s failure to either withdraw his guilty plea or raise the issue at sentencing rendered her representation less than meaningful, must also be rejected. Considering that defendant failed to raise this issue prior to sentencing and noting the advantageous plea agreement counsel negotiated, in which his sentence would run concurrent to a sentence for a previous conviction, we find that he received meaningful representation (see People v White, 47 AD3d 1062, 1064 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 818 [2008]; People v Edwards, 43 AD3d 1227, 1228 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 1005 [2007]).
Finally, defendant’s claim that his sentence was harsh and excessive is unavailing in light of the advantageous plea agreement which included a concurrent sentence.

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Mathews, J.), rendered May 19, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 4V2 to 9 years and 2 to 4. years, respectively. Defendant appeals contending that statements he made at sentencing cast doubt on the sufficiency of his plea allocution.
Initially, we note that inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, his claim has not been preserved for our review (see, People v Saitch, 260 AD2d 724, 725, lv denied 93 NY2d 1006; People v Smith, 184 AD2d 977). In any event, inasmuch as “there was sufficient factual basis for defendant’s plea and that plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered, a subsequent unsubstantiated claim of innocence is insufficient to warrant a vacatur of the plea” (People v Chappie, 269 AD2d 621, 622, lv denied 94 NY2d 917; see, People v Davis, 250 AD2d 939, 940; People v Smith, supra).

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, J.), rendered July 10, 2007, which resentenced defendant upon his conviction of the crimes of conspiracy in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered December 4, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence, without a hearing.
Defendant, facing charges for 23 crimes, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the second degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree in accordance with a detailed, written plea agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, if defendant cooperated with the People in their prosecution of his codefendants, the conspiracy conviction would stand but defendant would be permitted to withdraw the plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and enter a plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. In connection with the replea, the agreement provided that the range of defendant’s sentence would be a minimum possible sentence of three years to life and a maximum possible sentence of SVs years to life, to be followed by a period of postrelease supervision. No specific sentence was promised on either count. Defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal.
As contemplated, defendant cooperated with the People, withdrew his plea to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and eventually replaced it with a plea of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree. He was sentenced on the conspiracy conviction to a prison term of 4 to 12 years and on the criminal sale conviction—upon application of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005—to a prison term of seven years, with five years of postrelease supervision. The sentences were set to run concurrently.
Defendant subsequently moved pursuant to CPL 440.20 to have his sentence set aside, arguing that he did not receive the full benefit of his plea bargain because the parties had assumed that his maximum prison exposure would stem from the criminal sale conviction, rather than the conspiracy conviction. County Court denied defendant’s motion without a hearing. Defendant—raising only challenges to his sentence on the conspiracy conviction—now appeals from his judgment of conviction and from the order denying his CPL 440.20 motion.
Initially, although defendant waived his right to appeal, it is not clear that his waiver precludes a challenge to the sentence imposed on the conspiracy conviction. Although the written plea agreement executed by defendant clearly contemplates the waiver of his right to appeal from both convictions, defendant also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal that references only the criminal sale conviction. During the subsequent plea colloquy, County Court adequately apprised defendant of the rights he was giving up by waiving his right to appeal, but did not separately address the crimes to which he pleaded and, thus, did not dispel the confusion created by the disparity in the written documents. Under these circumstances, we cannot discern whether defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished his right to appeal from the conspiracy conviction and, therefore, we will address the merits of his appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Middleton, 72 AD3d 1336, 1337 [2010]; People v Moran, 69 AD3d 1055, 1056 [2010]; cf. People v Stokely, 49 AD3d 966, 967 [2008]).
First, we reject defendant’s assertion that he did not receive the full benefit of his plea bargain. Specifically, defendant contends that because during the plea negotiations the parties assumed that defendant’s maximum sentence would flow from the more serious criminal sale count, an implicit agreement arose that he would not be sentenced higher on the conspiracy count than on the criminal sale count. We find no evidence that a promise, express or implied, was made to defendant with regard to the sentence imposed upon his conspiracy conviction or that any understanding was reached that defendant would serve no more than the seven-year determinate sentence he ultimately obtained on the criminal sale conviction. Accordingly, we reject defendant’s request that we reduce his sentence for conspiracy in the second degree based on any failure by the People or County Court to abide by the plea agreement (see People v Cullen, 62 AD3d 1155, 1157 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009]; People v Long, 12 AD3d 788, 788-789 [2004], lv denied 4 NY3d 833 [2005]).
Defendant also argues that the sentence County Court imposed upon his conviction of conspiracy in the second degree is harsh and excessive. The sentence of 4 to 12 years is below the maximum and less than that recommended by the People (i.e., 5 to 15 years). Furthermore, the plea agreement specifically apprised defendant of a potential maximum aggregate prison sentence of 8Vs years to life. Contrary to defendant’s arguments, the fact that his cooperation coupled with the Drug Law Reform Act benefitted him to such an extent that his sentence on the criminal sale conviction may ultimately yield less prison time than the conspiracy conviction does not translate to a finding that his sentence on the conspiracy conviction is harsh, or even unjust. Indeed, we find nothing -in the rec ord revealing extraordinary circumstances warranting reduction of the sentence imposed, especially given defendant’s role as the leader of a significant cocaine distribution operation (see People v Middleton, 72 AD3d at 1337; People v Cam Quan, 26 AD3d 644, 644 [2006]).
We also reject defendant’s contention that his counsel was ineffective for failing to gain a maximum sentence cap on the conspiracy conviction which was lower than that given on the criminal sale conviction. A defendant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel will be satisfied “ ‘so long as the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation’ ” (People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998], quoting People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). Here, a review of the record reflects that counsel’s representation of defendant was meaningful. Indeed, defense counsel obtained an advantageous plea agreement for defendant, given the number and severity of the charges and defendant’s potential exposure to an extremely long sentence (see People v Riddick, 40 AD3d 1259, 1261 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 925 [2007]; People v Roberts, 38 AD3d 1014, 1015 [2007]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d 819, 819 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 708 [2004]).
Finally, we find no error in County Court’s denial of defendant’s CPL 440.20 motion without a hearing. Where, as here, the record conclusively refutes the claim that a sentencing promise was made in the context of a plea agreement but not kept, there is no entitlement to a hearing (see People v Brown, 23 AD3d 702, 702-703 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Lopez, 8 AD3d at 820).

Following defendant’s knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to a prison term of 4 to 8 years.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Danaher, Jr., J.), rendered January 6, 1995, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree.
Defendant was charged with the crimes of criminal mischief in the second and third degrees arising out of an incident wherein he smashed in the roof, hood, windows and lights of his former girlfriend’s parked car, causing over $3,200 in damage. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of the crime of criminal mischief in the third degree. He was sentenced, as a predicate felony offender, to one year in jail and directed to make financial restitution to the victim. Defendant appeals, contending that the People failed to abide by the terms of a plea bargain agreement whereby they allegedly were to recommend five years’ probation, rather than jail time.
Our review of the record reveals, however, that no plea bargain agreement was reached. Negotiations came to an impasse when defendant refused to agree to pay restitution in the amount of $3,200 and insisted upon a restitution hearing. At that point the People withdrew their original offer, stating on the record that no plea bargain agreement had been made; Nevertheless, defendant proceeded with his guilty plea, after explicitly confirming his understanding of the fact that the People would not be bound by their earlier recommendation. Since there was no agreement, the People had no obligation to abide by the terms suggested during the negotiation process.
We reject the contention that the sentence of one year in jail was harsh and excessive. The sentence was within the statutory guidelines and in view of defendant’s previous criminal record and the violent nature of his crime, does not represent an abuse of discretion (see, People v Burnett, 228 AD2d 788, 792).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Saratoga County (Scarano, Jr., J.), rendered July 14, 2003, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
After pleading guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant moved to withdraw his plea alleging that his plea was involuntary and the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. County Court denied the motion and thereafter sentenced defendant to the agreed-upon prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. Defendant now appeals.
We affirm. The record of the plea proceeding reveals that County Court fully advised defendant of the rights that he was relinquishing by operation of his plea and ascertained that defendant understood those rights and was pleading guilty of his own volition (see People v McCann, 303 AD2d 780, 781 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 584 [2003]). Moreover, defendant allocated to facts constituting the offense for which he was convicted (see Penal Law § 220.39 [1]) and admitted to being a predicate felon. Defendant’s claim that he was coerced into pleading guilty by representations made to him by counsel concerning the possible revocation of his bail are supported by nothing more than defendant’s own statements and, accordingly, County Court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Alexander, 97 NY2d 482, 485 [2002]; People v Lane, 1 AD3d 801, 802 [2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 742 [2004]; People v Bonilla, 285 AD2d 746, 747, 748 [2001]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Chemung County (Buckley, J.), rendered July 21, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant was indicted on one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was assigned a Public Defender but later requested a two-week adjournment so that he could retain private counsel. County Court granted the request but, at the next court appearance, defendant appeared with another Public Defender and expressed his desire to continue with assigned counsel. He thereafter entered a counseled Alford plea of guilty to one count of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment. Sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement as a second felony offender to an indeterminate prison term of 3 to 6 years, defendant appeals.
We reject defendant’s sole contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the Public Defenders failed to file certain pretrial motions and were not adequately prepared. Initially, the mere fact that counsel chose not to file the specified motions does not alone mandate the conclusion that counsel was unprepared or ineffective (see, People v Balzer, 155 AD2d 733, 734, lv denied 75 NY2d 810). The record reveals that the Public Defender who represented defendant throughout the majority of the proceedings was fully familiar with the case, filed an omnibus motion requesting discovery and several preliminary hearings, and negotiated a plea bargain that was extremely favorable in light of the severity of the crimes charged, defendant’s lengthy criminal history and his status as a second felony offender (see, People v Brown, 233 AD2d 764, 767, lv denied 89 NY2d 1009; People v Mackey, 175 AD2d 346, 349, lv denied 78 NY2d 969). Further, defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from counsel’s alleged failures and specifically expressed his satisfaction with the representation he received when he pleaded guilty. Under these circumstances, we find that defendant was afforded meaningful representation (see, People v Harris, 235 AD2d 941; People v Rafter, 234 AD2d 711, lv denied 89 NY2d 1014; People v St. John, 163 AD2d 687, lv denied 76 NY2d 944).

In satisfaction of a four-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to four years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision and ordered to make restitution of $100. On this appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant first argues that County Court did not advise him at the time of his plea that he would be sentenced as a second felony offender. However, the record before us fails to indicate that defendant preserved this claim by moving to either withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Mayers, 74 NY2d 931, 932 [1989]; People v Campbell, 66 AD3d 1059, 1059-1060 [2009]).

However, the People concede that restitution was not a part of the plea agreement. Accordingly, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remitted to County Court to either impose the agreed-upon sentence or give defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea before imposing the enhanced sentence (see People v Galietta, 75 AD3d 753, 754-755 [2010]; People v Gantt, 63 AD3d 1379, 1379-1380 [2009]).

Initially, defendant’s failure to move to withdraw her guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction precludes our review of her contention that her guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered (see, People v Rojas, 238 AD2d 727, 729; People v Battiste, 238 AD2d 724, 724-725). Nevertheless, were we to consider this claim, we would find it to be without merit. During plea negotiations, the prosecution made it clear that the offer was a plea of guilty to the top count of the indictment with 3 to 9 years in prison and that the recommended sentence might improve if defendant cooperated with the vice squad. No promises were made that the sentence would definitely be reduced. Defendant agreed to the plea bargain as communicated by the prosecution and was advised by County Court that the sentence imposed could be more severe depending upon the outcome of her presentence report. Although defendant expressed her disappointment at sentencing with the fact that the sentence was not reduced because the vice squad evidently did not contact her to obtain her assistance, we do not find that this renders her guilty plea involuntary (see, e.g., People v Berezansky, 229 AD2d 768, 769, lv denied 89 NY2d 919).
To the contrary, our review of the transcript of the plea al locution discloses that County Court explained to defendant the ramifications of pleading guilty, including the many rights she would be waiving by doing so. Defendant responded that she understood the court’s admonitions, that she wished to plead guilty of her own free will and was not coerced or threatened into doing so and that she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In view of this, we find that defendant’s guilty plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see, People v Battiste, supra, at 725; People v Nardi, 232 AD2d 673, 674, lv denied 89 NY2d 927; People v Berezansky, supra, at 769-770). Although defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal precludes her from challenging the sentence (see, People v Galarza, 237 AD2d 817, 818), we nevertheless do not find that it is harsh or excessive given defendant’s criminal history and that she agreed to the sentence as part of the plea bargain (see, People v Nardi, supra, at 674).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Forman, J.), rendered April 30, 2015, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant contends that his plea of guilty was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered because at the time of the plea he was not advised that his driver license would be suspended for six months. This issue is unpreserved for appellate review since the defendant did not move to vacate his plea prior to the imposition of sentence or otherwise raise the issue at sentencing (see People v Crowder, 24 NY3d 1134, 1136 [2015]; People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182 [2013]; People v Murray, 15 NY3d 725, 726-727 [2010]). In any event, contrary to the defendant’s contention, the suspension of his driver license in this case was a collateral, not a direct, consequence of his plea of guilty (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 403 [1995]; People v Trathen, 121 AD3d 1594, 1595 [2014]; People v Gerald, 103 AD3d 1249, 1250 [2013]; People v Goss, 286 AD2d 180, 182 [2001]). The court had no obligation to apprise the defendant of the collateral consequences of the plea (see People v Peque, 22 NY3d at 184; People v Gravino, 14 NY3d 546, 553 [2010]; People v Ford, 86 NY2d at 403). Accordingly, the defendant’s plea was not rendered unknowing, involuntary, or unintelligent by the failure to advise him at the time of the plea of the suspension of his driver license.
The sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).

"Mercure, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Giardino, J.), rendered November 23, 2004, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
After a confidential informant purchased drugs from defendant, he was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (two counts). Defendant’s motion to suppress the confidential informant’s identification of him was denied and, thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. During the plea proceeding, defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal and executed a comprehensive written waiver of that right. County Court sentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 42/s to 9Vs years in prison. Defendant appeals and we now affirm.
Defendant asserts that both his guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal were not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. This issue is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Schwickrath, 23 AD3d 707, 708 [2005]; see also People v Johnson, 82 NY2d 683, 685 [1993]). Moreover, this is not one of those rare instances in which “defendant’s recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon [his] guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea” such that the narrow exception to the preservation requirement is applicable (People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; see People v Ocasio, 265 AD2d 675, 676-678 [1999]). In any event, defendant’s statement that he was “tired right now” in response to County Court’s inquiry as to whether he was sick and tired of going back to prison “did not engender ‘significant doubt’ on the voluntariness of his plea” (People v Toxey, 86 NY2d 725, 726 [1995]) and, indeed, the record otherwise reveals that he entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; People v Tate, 28 AD3d 801, 802 [2006]; People v Sanzo, 28 AD3d 802 [2006]). Accordingly, defendant’s waiver of his right to appeal precludes his challenges to County Court’s suppression ruling, the severity of his sentence and, inasmuch as his argument does not bear upon the voluntariness of his guilty plea, his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the suppression hearing (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006], supra; People v Crannell, 23 AD3d 769, 769-770 [2005], lv denied 6 NY3d 774 [2006]; People v Schwickrath, supra, at 708).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Aison, J.), rendered January 7, 1993, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Defendant, through his attorney, offered to withdraw his previous plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty to the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of the six-count indictment filed against him. Upon defendant’s plea, it was understood that he should receive an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 6 to 12 years and pay restitution in the amount of $180. Defendant acknowledged in open court, in response to County Court’s question, the rights that he was forfeiting by his plea. Defendant further acknowledged that he had discussed the matter thoroughly with his attorney, that he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation and that he had not been persuaded, threatened or coerced into pleading guilty. Defendant further accepted the proposed sentence which was offered and which was imposed after his plea. Defendant, after conferring with his attorney, stated that he was willing to waive his right to appeal and all other rights that the court informed him of.
On this appeal, defendant claims that his waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary. We find this claim untenable. Defendant made no effort to preserve his claim at the time of his plea and failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction. Defendant, therefore, failed to preserve his claim (see, People v Negron, 193 AD2d 976, lv denied 82 NY2d 757). In any event, the record establishes a knowing and intelligent waiver of defendant’s right to appeal.
Defendant also attempts to raise for the first time on this appeal a claim that his legal representation was ineffective. Having expressed his satisfaction with his attorney at the time of his plea, defendant has failed to show any conflict of interest on his attorney’s part that ""affected, or operated on, or [bore] a substantial relation to the conduct of the defense” (People v Ortiz, 76 NY2d 652, 657). Defendant received the prison sentence of 6 to 12 years he agreed to, and the plea and sentence were beneficial to defendant. We find no reason to disturb it (see, People v Mackey, 136 AD2d 780, lv denied 71 NY2d 899).
Defendant also objects to the restitution ordered by the judgment. Prior to November 1, 1991, County Court lacked the authority to order restitution to a law enforcement agency for unrecovered funds used in the purchase of drugs as part of an investigation leading to a conviction (see, People v Rowe, 75 NY2d 948). Penal Law § 60.27 (9) was added to authorize such restitution. Defendant contends that the law enforcement agency seeking restitution in this case failed to file the affidavit required by Penal Law § 60.27 (9). We conclude, however, that the filing of the affidavit is not a matter that affects the court’s authority to order restitution, but relates to the amount of the restitution. After defense counsel noted that he had seen no restitution figures other than those stated by the District Attorney, defendant was advised that he had a right to a hearing on the amount of the restitution and that one would be held if he disputed the $180 figure stated by the District Attorney to have been expended by the undercover officers in the investigation of defendant’s drug-selling activities which resulted in defendant’s conviction. Defendant expressly consented to the amount. In these circumstances, we conclude that County Court did not err in ordering restitution in an amount to which defendant consented (see, People v Lugo, 191 AD2d 648). We reach a contrary conclusion as to the 5% surcharge ordered by the court, which is expressly prohibited by Penal Law § 60.27 (9).
Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by deleting so much thereof as imposed a 5% surcharge on the $180 amount of restitution, and, as so modified, affirmed.",,712,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Williams, J.), rendered October 10, 2012, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In satisfaction of a six-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a prior felony offender to eight years in prison, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.
Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Our review of the record reveals that defendant had a prior nonviolent felony conviction and County Court incorrectly informed him that he faced potential sentences of up to 15 years (compare Penal Law § 70.70 [3] [b] [i] [up to 12 years where prior felony was nonviolent] with Penal Law § 70.70 [4] [b] [i] [up to 15 years where prior felony was violent]). Since such inaccurate information is a factor when reviewing the plea (see People v Garcia, 92 NY2d 869, 870 [1998]), there is at least one nonfrivolous issue. Therefore, without passing judgment on the ultimate merit of this issue, we grant counsel’s application for leave to withdraw and assign new counsel to address this issue and any others that the record may disclose (see People v Stokes, 95 NY2d 633 [2001]; People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered March 14, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (three counts) and resisting arrest (two counts).
Following his plea of guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, two counts of crimi nal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and two counts of resisting arrest, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate indeterminate term of imprisonment of 10 to 30 years. Defendant now appeals.
Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that County Court erred in permitting him to proceed pro se. Our review of the record reveals that County Court conducted a thorough and searching inquiry, which revealed that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel (see, People v Pena, 247 AD2d 761, lv denied 92 NY2d 903). With regard to defendant’s contention that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made, we need note only that defendant failed to move to vacate the judgment of conviction or withdraw his plea, and his claims therefore are not preserved for our review (see, People v Epps, 255 AD2d 840). Finally, we find no merit to defendant’s assertion that the sentences imposed constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Such sentences were not only within the statutory parameters but, in fact, were less than those permitted.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (Rowley, J.), rendered April 12, 2002, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and forgery in the second degree.
Defendant was indicted and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and three counts of forgery in the second degree as a result of incidents that took place on December 16, 1998 in Tompkins County. Following a jury trial in January 1999, County Court submitted for the jury’s consideration a single count of forgery and criminal sale of a controlled substance, and defendant was convicted accordingly. Defendant’s conviction thereafter was vacated upon his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.
A second trial was held in January 2002 at which County Court submitted for the jury’s consideration a single count of forgery, criminal sale of a controlled substance and, unlike the first trial, criminal possession of a controlled substance. Defendant was found guilty of forgery, but the jury announced its inability to reach a verdict on the drug counts and County Court declared a mistrial. Thereafter, defendant was retried on the drug counts and found guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 5 to 10 years on the drug counts and 2 to 4 years on the forgery count. Defendant appeals.
Initially, we reject defendant’s contention that County Court erred in submitting the criminal possession of a controlled substance count to the juries at the second and third trials. While it is clear that County Court in the first trial had discretion as to how many concurrent counts it would submit to the jury (see CPL 300.40 [3], [4]) and, further, that its failure to submit the possession count constituted a dismissal thereof (see GPL 300.40 [7]), it is equally clear that when defendant’s first conviction was vacated as a result of his GPL 440.10 motion, all counts of the original indictment were preserved for retrial (see GPL 440.10 [6]). Thus, County Court was free to submit the drug possession count to the jury at the second trial and again upon retrial following the hung jury at the second trial. We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and find them equally without merit.

"Crew III, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (Hanofee, J.), entered January 4, 1990, (1) convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and (2) which revoked defendant’s probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
A two-count indictment was filed on August 30, 1989 charging defendant, in each count, with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. On December 4, 1989, defendant appeared in County Court and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. She was advised at that time by the court that the District Attorney would recommend at sentencing that she receive a prison sentence of 3 Vi to 7 years, to which her assigned counsel agreed. Defendant acknowledged that she understood that such would be the recommendation. It was also agreed that she would plead guilty to a violation of probation charge and that the sentence on that plea would run concurrently. On the day of sentencing, in accordance with CPL 400.21 (2), the People filed a statement alleging that defendant was the subject of a predicate felony conviction. County Court then inquired of defendant if it was a fact that she had previously been convicted of a felony on March 24, 1989 and she admitted that she had. She was then sentenced to the agreed-upon term of imprisonment of 3 Vi to 7 years. She was also sentenced to a concurrent prison term of 1 to 3 years on the probation violation. On this appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in failing to advise her that she was subject to mandatory sentencing as a second felony offender. We agree.
Initially, we observe that defendant failed to preserve the issue in question by not moving to withdraw her plea or to vacate her judgment of conviction. However, since the procedure challenged is on the face of the record, we will review the matter in the interest of justice (see, People v Di Paola, 143 AD2d 487).
A review of the record fails to demonstrate that defendant knew or was informed that she was subject to second felony offender treatment and was thereby subject to a mandatory prison sentence (see, Penal Law § 70.06). At the time the plea was taken, the sentence to be imposed on the drug charge was described only as a recommendation. Having been convicted by plea on prior occasions and, in each instance, sentenced to probation, defendant may have erroneously assumed, albeit unrealistically, that County Court might once again sentence her to probation or something substantially less than the recommendation. This case is in contrast to People v Harris (61 NY2d 9), where the defendant not only admitted his previous felony conviction but also acknowledged that he was subject to sentencing as a second felony offender, and People v Bouyea (64 NY2d 1140), where the defendant was apprised of and admitted the essence of his prior felony conviction at the time of his plea and raised no challenge to the court’s consideration of the prior conviction then or at the time of sentencing a month later.
While the courts have not developed any catechistic mandate with regard to a plea allocution, it is incumbent upon a trial court to ascertain that a plea is knowingly and voluntarily made (see, People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338). Such considera tions encompass the proposition that the defendant understands the possible penal sanctions to which he or she is subject (see, People v Woods, 50 AD2d 720). With that in mind, we believe that County Court, in the case at bar, should have been alerted to the fact that the recommended sentence was the result of second felony offender status and should have advised defendant that she would thereby be subject to mandatory imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of at least three years in order to ensure that her plea was voluntary in the sense that she understood the penal sanctions to which she was subject by reason of that conviction (see, People v Topping, 74 AD2d 703; People v Woods, supra). At the very least, given that the second felony offender statement was filed on the very day of sentencing, we believe that defendant should have been advised of her right to controvert the statement in accordance with CPL 400.21 (3) (see, People v Bryant, 47 AD2d 51). Accordingly, the conviction must be reversed and defendant given the opportunity to apply to County Court to withdraw her plea or to controvert the predicate conviction if she so chooses and is able. This applies as well to the violation of probation charge.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Clinton County (McGill, J.), rendered May 28, 2015, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
In October 2014, defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, one count of criminal possession of marihuana in the fourth degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to six months in jail, with five years of probation.
On appeal, defendant contends that County Court erred in failing to suppress the physical evidence (cocaine and marihuana) seized by the police because the seizure arose from an illegal detention following a traffic stop. Defendant filed an omnibus motion in December 2014, and a Huntley hearing was held on February 19, 2015 to determine the admissibility of defendant’s statements to the police. County Court issued a decision and order on February 23, 2015, which made no ruling with regard to the admissibility of the physical evidence. The People made a plea offer on March 25, 2015, and defendant entered a guilty plea on March 26, 2015 and was sentenced on May 28, 2015. We find that defendant forfeited his right to appellate review regarding the suppression issue because he entered his guilty plea before County Court rendered its decision on the motion to suppress the physical evidence (see People v Rodriguez, 118 AD3d 1182, 1182-1183 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 964 [2014]; People v Brabham, 112 AD3d 1066, 1067 [2013]; People v Morrison, 106 AD3d 1201, 1202 [2013], lv denied 23 NY3d 1065 [2014]).

In satisfaction of an eight-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes, defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree. In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest of which was 5 to 25 years. On this appeal, defendant’s attorney requests leave to withdraw as counsel on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Having reviewed the record, defense counsel’s brief and defendant’s pro se submission, we agree. There is no merit to defendant’s assertion that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed and defense counsel’s application for leave to withdraw is granted.

"Appeal unanimously held in abeyance from judgment, Supreme Court, New York County, entered September 9, 1976, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilcy, of criminal sale of a controlled substance, third degree, and imposing a term of one year to life imprisonment. The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this memorandum. The facts are that defendant sold controlled substances to a police officer on October 16, 23 and 27, 1975, and an indictment was filed on November 1, 1975, accusing him of these sales. Another indictment was filed on February 27, 1976, alleging a sale of October 7, 1975. On June 17, 1976, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale under the first indictment in satisfaction of both indictments and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one year to life imprisonment. Defendant now argues that when he took the plea on June 17, 1976, neither he, the court, prosecutor, nor defense counsel was aware of an amendment, effective July 1, 1976, to GPL 220.10 (subd 5, par [b]) which might have permitted him to plead down to as low as a class C felony. GPL 220.60 is clear that the court has discretion at any time before sentence to permit withdrawal of a previously entered plea of guilty, and although the respondent argues persuasively that the change in the law had been so publicized as to put the legal community on notice of it, nowhere does the record show that this change was known to either court or defense. On approving chapter 480 of the Laws of 1976, Governor Carey pointed out (McKinney’s Session Law News, No. 7 p A-356) that the A-III drug felony is the only criminal offense for which no lesser plea may be entered, despite the fact that limited plea bargaining was permitted in more serious drug offenses, and unlimited plea bargaining is available for all serious nondrug offenses. Passage of the bill was intended, obviously, to eliminate this inequity, and it would be in the interest of justice to permit the trial court to determine whether defendant should be afforded access to the benefits of this legislation. On the state of the record before us we are unable to determine whether or not the trial court exercised the discretion reposed in her by the amendment to the statute. We remand, therefore, for the specific exercise of such discretion to grant or deny an application by defendant to withdraw his plea under the circumstances outlined above. Concur—Birns, J.

"Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), both rendered December 15, 2015, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), under Indictment No. 126/14, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (four counts), under Indictment No. 41/14, upon a jury verdict. The court imposed determinate terms of imprisonment of 10 years for the convictions under counts one and two of Indictment No. 126/14 (criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree), to run concurrently with each other and consecutively to determinate concurrent terms of imprisonment of 10 years for the convictions under counts three and four of Indictment No. 126/14 (criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of controlled substance in the third degree). The court imposed determinate terms of imprisonment of 10 years for the convictions under counts one through four of Indictment No. 41/14 (criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree), to run concurrently with each other and consecutively to the terms imposed under Indictment No. 126/14. The court also imposed fines totaling $8,000 under Indictment No. 126/14, and $4,000 under Indictment No. 41/14. The appeals bring up for review the denial of the defendant’s omnibus motion to suppress physical evidence.
Ordered that the judgment under Indictment No. 41/14 is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that the sentences imposed for the convictions under counts one through four that indictment shall run concurrently with the sentences imposed for the convictions under counts one through four of Indictment No. 126/14; as so modified, the judgment under Indictment No. 41/14 is affirmed; and it is further,
Ordered that the judgment under Indictment No. 126/14 is affirmed.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the County Court did not err in denying so much of his omnibus motion as sought a hearing to controvert the search warrant, as he failed to make “the requisite preliminary showing that the affidavit in support of the warrant contained false statements” (People v Moshier, 110 AD3d 832, 833 [2013]; see People v McGeachy, 74 AD3d 989, 990 [2010]; People v Tordella, 37 AD3d 500 [2007]). The defendant failed to preserve for appellate review his contention that the court should have conducted a hearing to controvert the search warrant based on certain trial evidence (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Davis, 103 AD3d 810, 812 [2013]; People v Accardi, 222 AD2d 596, 597-598 [1995]). In any event, the defendant did not show that any additional “pertinent facts” mandated a hearing (CPL 710.40 [4]; see People v Giler, 148 AD3d 1053 [2017]; People v Ekwegbalu, 131 AD3d 982, 984 [2015]; People v Jackson, 97 AD3d 693, 694 [2012]).
The defendant also failed to preserve for appellate review his contention that two cell phones seized during his arrest should have been suppressed, as he did not raise, prior to or during trial, the specific contention that he now raises (see People v McDonald, 82 AD3d 1125, 1125-1126 [2011]; People v Saunders, 306 AD2d 502, 502-503 [2003]). In any event, any error in this regard was harmless: apart from the challenged evidence, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt and no reasonable possibility that any such error contributed to the conviction (see People v Lewis, 23 NY3d 179, 189 [2014]; People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 241-242 [1975]; People v Olsen, 148 AD3d 829 [2017]).
The defendant did not object to the prosecutor’s summation remark that he now challenges as improper. Accordingly, his contention in this regard is unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Morris, 2 AD3d 652 [2003]; People v McHarris, 297 AD2d 824 [2002]). In any event, that isolated remark was responsive to the defense summation and did not, by itself, deprive the defendant of a fair trial (see People v Adamo, 309 AD2d 808, 810 [2003]; see also People v Clark, 222 AD2d 446, 447 [1995]).
The record, viewed in totality, showed that the defendant was afforded the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137 [1981]).
The sentence imposed under Indictment No. 41/14 was excessive to the extent indicated herein (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). The sentence imposed under Indictment No. 126/14 was not excessive (see id.).

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered October 2, 1996, convicting her of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and sentencing her to an indeterminate term of 12x/2 to 25 years imprisonment under count one of the indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and an indeterminate term of I2V2 to 25 years imprisonment under count two of the indictment charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, which sentences were to run concurrently, and an indeterminate term of I2V2 to 25 years imprisonment under count three of the indictment charging criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and an indeterminate term of I2V2 to 25 years imprisonment under count four of the indictment charging criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, which sentences were to run concurrently to one another and consecutively to the sentences imposed under counts one and two of the indictment.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discre tion in the interest of justice, by making the terms of imprisonment imposed on the defendant’s convictions under counts three and four of the indictment run concurrently to the terms of imprisonment imposed on the defendant’s convictions under counts one and two of the indictment; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the jury, which saw and heard the witnesses (see, People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94). Its determination should be accorded great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless clearly unsupported by the record (see, People v Garafolo, 44 AD2d 86, 88). Upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).
The sentence was excessive to the extent indicated.

"Appeal by defendant “from so much of a judgment” of the County Court, Hassau County, rendered May 4, 1965 on his plea of guilty, convicting him, inter alia, of a violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law (violation as a misdemeanor with respect to narcotic drugs), as sentenced him to .a term of one year in the Hassau County jail upon the ground that it was excessive. Judgment affirmed. The appellant and a eodefendant were indicted by a 71-count indictment which charged them with feloniously selling a .narcotic drug (counts 1-14); selling a narcotic drug in violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law (counts 15-28); selling a drug in violation of section 6804 (subd. 3, par. m) of the Education Law (counts 29-49); selling a drug in violation of section 6804 (subd. 3, par. k) of the Education Law (counts 50-70); and failure to keep records in violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law (count 71). Count 13 accused the defendants of feloniously selling a narcotic drug in that they peddled and sold “a quantity of a narcotic drug, to wit, a quantity of Robitussin AC with Codeine in quantities of more than four fluid ounces to one person at one time, contrary to the Public Health Law During trial, appellant pled guilty to the attempted felonious selling of a narcotic drug under count 13, in satisfaction of the indictment. The codefendant made a similar plea to count 12, which was similar to count 13. At sentencing both defendants amended their guilty pleas to include pleas of guilty to the 71st count, which charged them with the misdemeanor of violation of section 1751-a of the Penal Law in that they, “ between, on or about the 1st day of April, 1964 and on or about the 11th day of June, 1964, failed to keep records of all narcotic drugs received and disposed of by them, to wit, medicinal preparations containing Codeine were sold and all sales were not recorded as required by the Public Health Law, Section 3333, subdivision 3 ”. The court sentenced the appellant on the felony count, count 13, to a term of 2% to 5 years and suspended the execution of the sentence. On the misdemeanor count, count 71, the court sentenced the appellant to a term of one year in the Nassau County jail. The codefendant received similar sentences on counts 12 and 71. The appeal by the appellant is from so much of the judgment convicting him of count 71 as sentenced him to a term of one year in the Nassau County jail. He contends that said sentence is excessive. The appeal is based on his contentions that: (1) the sentence on the misdemeanor count was imposed on the assumption, without any warrant in the record, that he had committed other violations of law not covered by the counts to which he had pleaded guilty; (2) as a matter of discretion, the sentence was excessive. When due consideration is given to the nature of the crimes involved, the necessity for protecting society and attempting to prevent future offenses of the same kind (ef. 15 Am. Jur., Criminal Law, § 506), the legislative policy of imposing sentences in narcotic eases that are so severe that they will act as deterrents (cf. Annual Message of the Governor, Public Papers of Thomas E. Dewey, 1952, pp. 12-13; Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, Fallon Publications, 1947, Address before the New York Academy of Medicine, November 1, 1928, p. 379; cf. People v. Corapi, 42 Misc 2d 247, 250), and the contents of the probation report (cf. Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241; People v. Leipzig, 23 A D 2d 854; People v. Dusablon, 16 N Y 2d 9, 17), it may not be held that the sentence was excessive. People v. Ayiotis (23 A D 2d 760) is readily distinguishable. Insofar as it may be read as prohibiting a sentencing Judge from taking into consideration facts directly related to the crimes with which the defendant was charged and to the crimes of which he was convicted, as revealed in the probation report, merely because the defendant, in pleading guilty to some counts of the indictment did not plead guilty to other counts, it is overruled (cf.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (Moynihan, Jr., J.), rendered March 13, 1989, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and (2) by permission, from an order of said court, entered September 6, 1989, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, without a hearing.
Defendant was arrested on November 15, 1988 and charged with harassment. As the result of a search of a handbag in defendant’s possession at the time of the arrest, he was later indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and harassment. Defendant contested the constitutional validity of the search and, following an evidentiary hearing, County Court denied his motion to suppress.
Defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence before the Grand Jury was not legally sufficient. The day after that motion was made, and prior to the return date, the case was calendared for a conference at which time, without ruling on the motion, County Court accepted a waiver of indictment and the filing of a superior court information, charging defendant with attempted possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and harassment, upon the People’s representation that they were prepared to withdraw the indictment upon the understanding that the defendant would plead guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. The court approved the waiver and accepted defendant’s plea of guilty to the superior court information. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of lió to 3 years. Counsel for defendant filed a notice of appeal. Some months later defendant, acting pro se, moved to vacate the conviction and County Court denied that motion. This court granted permission to appeal from said denial.
It is clear that the conviction must be reversed and the superior court information dismissed. CPL 195.10 provides for waiver of indictment in a superior court at any time prior to the return of an indictment by a Grand Jury. Where an indictment has been returned for a crime arising out of the transaction for which defendant has been held for Grand Jury action, a subsequent superior court information encompassing crimes arising out of that transaction is fatally defective (People v Boston, 75 NY2d 585). While County Court advised defendant that the indictment would be dismissed upon his plea to the superior court information, nothing in the record reflects that was done. Accordingly, the case must be remitted to County Court for further proceedings on the indictment.
In view of our decision herein it is unnecessary for us to reach the contention of defendant that County Court erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. Were we to do so we would find that the search was constitutionally impermissible (see, People v Gokey, 60 NY2d 309).

"Defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, and with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first, second and third degrees. Defendant was alleged to have sold approximately four ounces of cocaine on both November 7 and 26, 1984. On each occasion he was said to have received over $5,000 in exchange for the drug.
Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in full satisfaction of the indictment. On accepting the plea, the sentencing court indicated that pursuant to its agreement with the District Attorney, defendant would be sentenced to a minimum of five years and a maximum of life imprisonment.
The presentence report, made available to the court only subsequent to the plea, was reportedly favorable to defendant. Citing defendant’s lack of criminal involvement prior to the present matter and his otherwise stable life, it recommended a more lenient sentence than the one agreed to as part of the plea bargain. At the sentencing proceeding the court indicated its desire to moderate the sentence in conformity with the presentence report recommendation. The District Attorney, however, would not consent to the proposed change in the agreement pursuant to which the plea was entered. The court, characterizing the previously agreed to sentence as ""excessive” and ""overkill”, nevertheless expressed the conviction that it was constrained to honor its agreement with the District Attorney. It, therefore, proceeded to sentence defendant to a five-years-to-life term of imprisonment.
On appeal defendant maintains, and the People concede, that the sentencing court was not bound by its agreement with the District Attorney. Sentencing is a function committed exclusively to the court’s sound discretion (People v Farrar, 52 NY2d 302, 305; People v Maldonado, 70 AD2d 308). Many factors must be weighed in determining an appropriate sentence, among them the nature of the crime, the defendant’s circumstances, the need for societal protection, and the prospects for the defendant’s rehabilitation. The consideration and balancing of these factors is ultimately the province of the court since the court alone, in the criminal justice process, is sufficiently detached from outside pressures to fairly and objectively accommodate public and private interests and so arrive at a just sentence (People v Farrar, supra, at pp 305-306).
The sentencing court in the instant matter was thus free and, indeed, duty bound to exercise its discretion in imposing sentence. (Supra, at p 306.) Its failure to do so was error and makes it appropriate that we remand the matter for resentencing. (Supra, at p 307.)
Upon remand, the presentence report, unavailable when the plea was entered, is clearly relevant to the court’s exercise of discretion. Also relevant, however, are the nature of the offense for which the plea was entered and the underlying conduct to which defendant has admitted. We take special note that defendant’s conviction stems from his very lucrative sales of considerable quantities of cocaine. Profiting from the sale of a substance that has so ravaged our society is indeed a grave offense and we have serious question whether a proper exercise of discretion would allow moderation of the sentence agreed to by all concerned, including defendant, at the entry of the plea. Should the sentencing court decide to impose a lesser sentence than that previously agreed to as part of the plea bargain, the People should, of course, be given the opportunity to withdraw their consent to the plea.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Broome County (Smith, J.), rendered December 18, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In August 1997, defendant was indicted and charged with the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and in accordance with a plea agreement was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to 3V2 to 7 years. Prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea of guilty, which motion was denied without a hearing. Defendant subsequently appealed his judgment of conviction, and this Court withheld decision and remitted the matter to County Court for an evidentiary hearing and reconsideration of defendant’s motion to withdraw (271 AD2d 756). Upon remittal, County Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, following which defendant’s motion was granted, the judgment of conviction and the sentence was set aside, defendant’s guilty plea was vacated, his plea of not guilty was restored and the matter was ordered scheduled for trial. Under the circumstances, the appeal is now moot.

"Appeals by the defendant from three judgments of the County Court, Orange County (McLoughlin, J.), each rendered March 2, 2016, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 15-00438, criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 15-00439, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under indictment No. 15-00499, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences.
Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.
The defendant contends that his pleas were not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent because the County Court failed to sufficiently advise him of the constitutional rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and because he lacked the capacity to understand the plea proceedings due to medication he was taking at that time. However, the defendant’s contention is unpreserved for appellate review because the defendant did not move to vacate his pleas or otherwise raise the issue in the County Court (see CPL 220.60 [3]; People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 182 [2013]; People v Clarke, 93 NY2d 904, 906 [1999]; People v Morris, 147 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2017]; People v Jackson, 114 AD3d 807 [2014]). In any event, the pleas were knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17 [1983]). The court adequately advised the defendant of the constitutional rights he was surrendering by pleading guilty (see Boykin v Alabama, 395 US 238, 243 [1969]; cf. People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359 [2013]), and the record affirmatively demonstrates the defendant’s understanding and waiver of those constitutional rights (see People v Sirico, 135 AD3d 19, 22 [2015]; People v Isaiah S., 130 AD3d 1081, 1082 [2015]; People v Bennett, 122 AD3d 871, 872 [2014]).
Furthermore, the defendant’s assertion that he did not understand the plea proceedings because he was taking medication for a psychological condition is belied by the transcript of the plea proceedings, which demonstrates that the defendant expressly denied taking any drugs at that time and confirmed that he understood what was happening (see People v Quinones, 63 AD3d 759, 760 [2009]; People v Brooks, 36 AD3d 929, 930 [2007]; People v Bangert, 107 AD2d 752, 753 [1985]). While the presentence report contains the defendant’s postplea statement that he was prescribed medication for depression while incarcerated, there is no basis in the record to support his contention that he lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings against him (see People v Morris, 147 AD3d 1083, 1084 [2017]; People v Thomas, 139 AD3d 986, 987 [2016]; People v Narbonne, 131 AD3d 626, 627 [2015]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Putnam County (Braatz, J.), rendered May 22, 1991, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the appeal is dismissed.
The defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. At the time of the plea, the County Court made sure that the defendant understood that, as a condition of the plea bargain, he was surrendering his right to appeal:
""Q. Do you understand that as part of this plea negotiation, that is the guilty plea to Count Four in full satisfaction of the six charges in the indictment, six B felonies and also in consideration and in exchange for the District Attorney’s position on sentencing, that is recommending a sentence of four to eight as a second felony offender and agreeing not to file a persistent felony offender statement and agreeing not to seek to have you adjudicated as a persistent felony offender and recommending a sentence of four to eight which is below the maximum, do you understand that we are asking you to give up as part of this plea and sentence your right to appeal to higher courts in New York State, do you understand that?
""A. Yes.
""Q. Do you understand absent giving up this right to appeal you would have the right to appeal the conviction and the sentence to the Appellate Division Second Department and possibly as well to the New York Court of Appeal[s]?
""A. Yes.
""Q. Do you understand that — let me withdraw that. Are you doing this freely and voluntarily?
""A. Yes I am.
""Q. And, have you consulted with [defense counsel] concerning your waiver of your right to appeal?
""A. Yes.
""Q. And, is that understood by you to be part and parcel of our agreement in accepting the plea and in making that sentence and recommendation?
""A. Yes”.
When he appeared for sentencing, the defendant, contradicting the statements made at the time of the plea, told the court, ""I do wish to appeal my sentence” and ""I want it appealed”. The defendant claimed that his former attorney had not told him that he had to give up his right of appeal. The defendant did not request restoration to his pre-plea status; instead, he applied to the County Court for what would have amounted to permission to appeal notwithstanding his prior waiver.
We conclude that the court did not err in denying what was, in effect, an application by the defendant for leave to withdraw the waiver of his right to appeal. The record of the plea proceeding establishes that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1; see also, People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 911). There is no valid basis upon which to relieve the defendant of the consequences of that waiver. Mangano, P.

Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of conviction of the County Court of Chemung County upon a jury verdict of guilty of selling a dangerous drug in the second degree and imposing sentence for not less than 4 years and not more than 12 years. The appellant contends that the retained trial counsel was so ineffective as an advocate that in effect the proceedings were a mockery of justice. (See People v. Smith, 31 A D 2d 847.) However, the fact that certain objections might have been made and thereby put opposing counsel to further efforts does not establish ineffectiveness. The record establishes that the defense counsel at trial was aware of those matters which the People had to establish and effectively attempted to cast doubt upon the People’s proof. The experience of the members of the State Police who testified was sufficiently explored upon the record to permit them to express their opinion that the substance received from defendant “appeared to be marijuana”. The qualifications of the chemists were also sufficiently explored and their identification of the substance as marijuana obviated any reliance by the jury upon the opinion of the police officers as to what the substance “ appeared ” to be. The court, upon sentencing, specified that the defendant had been convicted of three separate criminal acts and it is obvious that the court, while feeling that justice did not require consecutive sentences, did feel that justice required a minimum sentence. Accordingly, the reference of the court to setting a minimum sentence because it was not imposing consecutive sentences is a sufficient expression of reason to comply with section 70.00 (subd. 3, par. [b]) of the Penal Law. Furthermore, the term of imprisonment does not appear to be excessive. Judgment affirmed. Herlihy, P.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Delaware County (Becker, J.), rendered March 28, 2005, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
The sole issue on this appeal is whether defendant’s prison sentence of 1 to 3 years for criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree is harsh and excessive. Upon review of the record, we find that it is not. Defendant agreed to the sentence in accordance with the negotiated plea bargain (see People v Smith, 263 AD2d 676, 677 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1027 [1999]; People v Walters, 216 AD2d 611, 612 [1995]). Moreover, there is no indication that County Court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence, nor are there any extraordinary circumstances present that would warrant a modification thereof (see People v Wallis, 24 AD3d 1029, 1033 [2005]; People v McCarthy, 23 AD3d 919, 919-920 [2005]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Zittell, J.), rendered March 29, 1985, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and the violation of unlawful possession of marihuana.
In February 1984, defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony, endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor, and unlawful possession of marihuana, a violation. At trial, the court dismissed the charge of endangering the welfare of a child. The jury subsequently found defendant guilty of the marihuana violation and a lesser included offense of the felony charge, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a misdemeanor. Defendant was sentenced to the maximum allowable jail period of one year for her conviction of the misdemeanor. Defendant appeals to this court alleging errors in sentencing.
We reject defendant’s assertion that the presentencing report was inflammatory and prejudicial. Our review of the report reveals nothing so prejudicial as to warrant reversal of her sentence. Indeed, the only arguably inflammatory material in the presentencing report was expressly disregarded by the sentencing court.
Defendant’s contention that it was error for the court not to disclose its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence is not supported by law. It is within the sentencing court’s discretion whether or not to set forth on the record the reasons for the sentence imposed (see, CPL 380.50; Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 380.50, p 164). The court did not abuse its discretion in not elaborating on the factors it found relevant for sentencing purposes.
Defendant’s contention that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive is without merit. The sentence imposed was legally permissible and defendant, who admitted to a $100-a-day heroin and cocaine habit, has failed to show a clear abuse of discretion by the court or any extraordinary circumstances justifying a modification of her sentence (see, People v Mabry, 101 AD2d 961, 963).

"—Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Columbia County (Czajka, J.), rendered October 28, 1997, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (eight counts), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (four counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (four counts).
Defendant pleaded guilty to a 16-count indictment charging him with various drug-related crimes without having negotiated a specific sentencing commitment. He was thereafter sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each crime, the longest of which was 11 to 22 years. Defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive in light of, inter alia, his demonstrated remorse and commitment toward rehabilitation. Given the quantity of cocaine involved and defendant’s prior drug-related conviction, we find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction in the sentence imposed (see generally, People v Owens, 242 AD2d 797; People v Comer, 236 AD2d 658, lv denied 89 NY2d 1090).

"Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Albany County, rendered March 4, 1974, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 21 months to life. The defendant contends on this appeal that the identification made of him by the State trooper as the person who made the sales of heroin to him should be suppressed for the reason that the trooper was supplied with a photograph of the defendant by the Albany Police Department, and secondly that, in any event, since it was not established that the substance sold-was heroin, the trial court should not have accepted defendant’s plea of guilty. We find no merit in either contention. The trial court concluded that the State trooper could make an in-court identification of the defendant based upon his observations of the accused, not only when the sales were made, but also on two prior occasions. This finding is supported by the evidence which clearly demonstrates an independent and untainted basis for the in-court identification aside from the photograph of the defendant (People v La Brake, 51 AD2d 609; People v Miller, 43 AD2d 605). As to the defendant’s second argument, the record discloses that in response to the court’s questions as to whether he had sold heroin to the State trooper on the dates in question, the defendant answered that he did. Furthermore, by his plea of guilty the defendant admitted that he committed the crimes charged. Judgment affirmed. Koreman, P.

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Montgomery County (Sise, J.), rendered June 8, 1998, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
Pursuant to a plea-bargaining agreement, defendant waived indictment, consented to the filing of a superior court information charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, pleaded guilty thereto and waived his right to appeal. In exchange, County Court agreed to sentence defendant as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 3V2 to 7 years. At the time of sentencing, the People requested that defendant be ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $100 to the City of Amsterdam Police Department pursuant to Penal Law § 60.27 (9).
While it is true, as defendant contends, that because the negotiated plea did not include mention of restitution, defendant was entitled to withdraw his plea or accept the greater sentence of restitution (see, People v Cowan, 168 AD2d 509), the record reflects that defendant elected to pursue the latter option. At the time the People requested restitution, defense counsel, in response to County Court’s inquiry, acknowledged that restitution had not been addressed previously and asked for a moment to confer with his client. Thereafter, defense counsel advised the court that he had discussed the matter with defendant, who agreed to pay the restitution as requested and personally acknowledged to the court that such was the case. Under the circumstances, defendant cannot now be heard to complain. We have examined defendant’s remaining contentions and find them lacking in merit.

"Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (Clyne, J.), rendered January 14, 1983, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, and (2) from a judgment of said court, rendered January 14, 1983, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of bail jumping in the first degree. H Defendant was convicted after trial of selling LSD to an undercover State Police investigator and pleaded guilty to bail jumping in the first degree. He was sentenced to concurrent indefinite terms of imprisonment of five years to life for the drug sale and one to four years for bail jumping. Defendant contends that on this appeal that the affirmative defense of entrapment was established as a matter of law at the trial and, although he failed to raise the defense affirmatively as required by law, he is entitled nonetheless to a reversal. Defendant neither interposed the defense of entrapment nor offered proof thereof and he failed to request a charge on the issue. We do not agree with defendant’s contention that the evidence presented proves entrapment as a matter of law. The conduct of the police agent did not rise to the level of “active inducement or encouragement” as required by section 40.05 of the Penal Law (see People v Seale, 47 NY2d 923). Having failed to raise the defense at trial, defendant is foreclosed from litigating the issue for the first time on appeal (see People v Irby, 61 AD2d 386, 400, mod on other grounds 47 NY2d 894). H We also find no merit in defendant’s contention that section 220.00 (subd 1) of the Penal Law is unconstitutionally vague. The statute is clear on its face and sets out in unambiguous language what acts are proscribed. We also find that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive under the circumstances. The transgression was a serious one and defendant’s disregard of the law is further evidenced by his bail jumping. We decline to substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing court under these circumstances. ¶ Judgments affirmed. Mahoney, P.

Appeals (1) from a judgment of the County Court of Sullivan County (LaBuda, J.), rendered June 17, 2002, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crimes of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, and (2) from a judgment and amended judgment of said court, rendered May 12, 2006 and June 21, 2006, which resentenced defendant.
In January 2002, defendant was indicted and charged with one count each of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first and second degrees, one count each of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first and second degrees, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (two counts) and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts). Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and was sentenced to SVs years to life in prison on his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and 3 to 9 years in prison for his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree, said sentences to run concurrently. In July 2005, defendant moved to set aside or modify his sentence on his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree pursuant to the provisions of the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (see L 2005, ch 643). Following a resentencing hearing, County Court vacated defendant’s sentence and resentenced him to a determinate sentence of 8V3 years in prison together with five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals from the original judgment of conviction, as well as the judgment and amended judgment resentencing him.
We affirm. While there is merit to defendant’s claim that he did not effectively waive his right to appeal at the time of his plea and sentencing in 2002, our review of the record reveals that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived such right at the time of resentencing. Nevertheless, were we to consider his argument that the abbreviated sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, we would reject such contention. Defendant’s sentence of 3 to 9 years for his conviction of criminal possession of marihuana in the first degree and his resentence to a determinate prison term of 8V3 years for his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree clearly were within the permissible statutory range, and we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction thereof (see People v Thompson, 33 AD3d 1131, 1131 [2006]).

Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Rensselaer County (McGrath, J.), rendered March 16, 2000, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.
In December 1998, following his arrest on several drug-related charges, defendant entered a plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree with the understanding that he would be sentenced to time served and a five-year term of probation. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant agreed to enter a drug treatment facility, and County Court warned him that if he left the program prior to sentencing, he could be sentenced to the maximum term of 2V3 to 7 years in prison. Nevertheless, defendant left the program, failed to appear on the date scheduled for sentencing and, in August 1999, was arrested in New York County on a number of serious charges. In satisfaction of those charges, he ultimately entered a plea of guilty of robbery in the first degree and was sentenced to a five-year determinate prison term. While serving that term, he was returned to County Court in March 2000 for sentencing and the court imposed the 21/s to 7-year maximum term consecutive to the determinate term. Defendant appeals.
Citing his age of 20 and lack of a criminal record when he committed the instant offense, defendant contends that the sentence was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Despite defendant’s youth and lack of criminal record, the presentence report reveals that defendant admitted to having been barred from one high school as a troublemaker, never having been employed and having supported a lifestyle that included marihuana use and alcohol abuse by selling drugs. In addition, defendant’s youth and lack of a criminal record were taken into account when he was accorded a substantial measure of leniency by County Court’s agreement to the probationary term of the plea bargain. Defendant clearly was warned that his receipt of this leniency was conditional and that he faced the maximum term in prison if he left the drug treatment program prior to sentencing. Defendant subsequently not only left the drug treatment program and failed to appear for sentencing, but also engaged in additional serious criminal activity that resulted in a prison term. We see no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed, and the record contains no mitigating factors that would warrant a sentence any less harsh than that imposed. Nor is there anything in the record to demonstrate that defendant should have been accorded the benefit of concurrent sentencing (see, People v McManus, 124 AD2d 305). In these circumstances, we also reject defendant’s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing by counsel’s failure to emphasize defendant’s youth and lack of a prior criminal record.

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered May 30, 1991, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and sentencing him to three indeterminate terms of 25 years to life imprisonment for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (three counts), all to run consecutively, and two indeterminate terms of 25 years to life imprisonment for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), both to run concurrently with each other and with the terms imposed for his convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant’s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification evidence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by deleting the provision thereof which provides that the defendant’s sentences for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree are to run consecutively to each other and substituting therefor a provision providing that the sentences are to run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, we find that the hearing court did not err in denying suppression of the in-court identifications of the defendant by four of the undercover police officers who had acted as purchasers during the three sales in question. At the Wade hearing, the officers testified that each had observed the defendant for a few minutes at close range, and under very good lighting conditions. The record, therefore, supports the hearing court’s determination that an independent source existed to support the officers’ in-court identifications of the defendant (see, United States v Wade, 388 US 218; see, e.g., People v Rowan, 199 AD2d 546, 547; People v Di Girolamo, 197 AD2d 531, 532-533; People v Brown, 191 AD2d 502; People v Ericsen, 186 AD2d 219; People v Benbow, 180 AD2d 805).
The defendant’s contention that he was deprived of a fair trial on the ground that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner is unpreserved for appellate review (see, People v Cruz, 200 AD2d 581). In any event, even assuming that the defendant presented a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection, the record supports the trial court’s conclusion that the prosecutor articulated racially neutral reasons for excusing the two black prospective jurors in question (see, Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79; People v Kern, 75 NY2d 638, cert denied 498 US 824; People v Hernandez, 75 NY2d 350, affd 500 US 352; People v Okehoffurum, 201 AD2d 508, 509).
The defendant’s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish his guilt is also unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Udzinski, 146 AD2d 245). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).
Contrary to the defendant’s contention, there is no evidence in the record which indicates that the defendant was punished for exercising his right to a jury trial (see, People v Canute, 190 AD2d 745; People v Sherrod, 181 AD2d 700; People v Brown, 157 AD2d 790, 792). Moreover, the sentencing court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing the defendant as a persistent felony offender (see, Penal Law § 70.10 [2]; CPL 400.20 [1] [b]). We find, however, that under all of the relevant circumstances, including the fact that the sentence imposed exceeded that recommended by the prosecutor, the sentence was excessive to the extent indicated (see, e.g., People v Portillo, 190 AD2d 827).

"Per Curiam.
Defendant was convicted, on a plea of guilty, of attempted grand larceny in the third degree and petit larceny and sentenced to one year on each charge, the terms to run. consecutively. Although a medical report of examination pursuant to section 81.19 of the Mental Hygiene Law found defendant to be a narcotics addict, and the defendant admitted to being an addict, the trial court, after a hearing, refused to make any determination as to addiction prior to sentencing. The subsequent determination of nonaddiction by the trial court after sentencing, in response to habeas corpus application, does not salvage the trial court’s disregard of section 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law which mandates that a finding of addiction or nonaddiction must be made prior to sentencing.
As to defendant’s contention that he is entitled to a jury trial on the issue of addiction or nonaddiction the statute (Mental Hygiene Law, § 81.21, subd. [a]) is equally clear — only a convicted misdemeanant who denies addiction or stands mute is entitled to a jury trial. Here, defendant has admitted he is an addict and the only purpose of a hearing is for the court to “ satisfy” itself that the defendant is or is not an addict. A jury trial is not necessary to achieve that result.
The question of whether or not a defendant convicted of multiple misdemeanors and subject to sentences amounting to more than one year in jail can be sentenced under the Penal Law rather than certified to the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission is not reached on this appeal.
The judgments of conviction should be modified by reversing them on the law with respect to the sentences and remanding the cases to the Criminal Court, New York County for resentencing in accordance with section 81.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law, and, as modified unanimously affirmed.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Groh, J.), rendered April 19, 1991, convicting her of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, upon her plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
The record does not afford a sufficient basis for concluding that the defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal was knowing, intelligent, or voluntary (see, People v DeSimone, 80 NY2d 273). There was no discussion on the record between the court and the defendant concerning the waiver. Moreover, there is nothing in the record indicating an attempt by the court to ascertain on the record an acknowledgement from the defendant that she had, in fact signed the waiver or that, if she had, she was aware of its contents (see, People v DeSimone, supra). Accordingly, there is no assurance that the waiver was executed under constitutionally acceptable circumstances (see, People v DeSimone, supra).
As part of the negotiated plea, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment. The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law §§ 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally low sentence for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony, which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that her conviction should be reduced to a class A-II felony, and the People consent to that reduction. Under these circumstances, the conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced, in the interest of justice, to the lesser included offense of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law § 220.18) in order to better effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489).
We note in conclusion that the sentence imposed was not an excessive one for a class A-II felony (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Bracken, J.

"—Judgment unanimously modified as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice and as modified affirmed in accordance with the following Memorandum: Defendant was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and unlawfully dealing with a child in the first degree. Following plea negotiations, the People agreed to allow defendant to plead guilty to a class D felony with an agreed-upon sentence of 3 to 9 years, conditioned on defendant’s cooperation with undercover investigations. County Court advised defendant that it would not abide by the agreed-upon sentence if defendant failed to appear at sentencing. When defendant failed to appear at sentencing, the court issued a bench warrant for defendant’s arrest. When he appeared before the court following that arrest, defendant advised the court that, on the date of sentencing, he had been incarcerated in Onondaga County Jail and had asked correction officers to contact Cayuga County Court to explain why he was unable to appear for sentencing. Although they allegedly told defendant that they would, they did not do so. Defendant further stated that he had attempted to contact defense counsel, but that counsel had left his employment and the current defense counsel was assigned without defendant’s knowledge. Current defense counsel confirmed that fact. The court imposed a sentence of 8V3 to 25 years.
Under the circumstances, and in the exercise of our discretion, we vacate the sentence and impose the originally bargained for sentence of 3 to 9 years.
We have considered defendant’s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed.
Memorandum: Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement that included the waiver of his right to appeal, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.39 [1]) in full satisfaction of the charges against him and was sentenced as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 7 to 14 years. By failing to move to withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction, defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that County Court abused its discretion in accepting his plea because it included a waiver of the right to appeal (see generally People v Hobart, 286 AD2d 916, 916, lv denied 97 NY2d 683). The challenge of defendant to the severity of the sentence is encompassed by his waiver of the right to appeal (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737).

"Appeal by the defendant from an order of the County Court, Orange County (Freehill, J.), dated September 30, 2013, which, after a hearing, upon remittitur from this Court, specified and informed him that the court would impose determinate terms of imprisonment of 17V2 years to run consecutively to each other, followed by a five-year period of postrelease supervision, in the event of a resentence, in effect, pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738), on his conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree under indictment No. 04-536, upon a jury verdict, and on his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree under indictment No. 04-594, upon a jury verdict, which sentences were originally imposed April 14, 2005.
Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Orange County, for further proceedings in accordance herewith.
The defendant was charged under two separate indictments with various drug offenses relating to a joint investigation by state and federal authorities into gang-related narcotics trafficking in the City of Newburgh. Under Orange County indictment No. 04-536, the defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (a class A-I felony), and sentenced to an indeterminate term of 17½ years to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed the judgment of conviction (see People v Garcia, 57 AD3d 918 [2008]). Under Orange County indictment No. 04-594, the defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (a class A-I felony), criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree (a class A-II felony), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (a class A-II felony), and two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (a class B felony). The defendant was sentenced to indeterminate terms of 17½ years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, eight years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, eight years to life imprisonment on the count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, and 5 to 15 years imprisonment on each count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The sentence on the count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree was to run concurrently with the sentences on the remaining counts in indictment No. 04-594, and consecutively to the sentence under indictment No. 04-536. This Court affirmed the judgment of conviction (see People v Garcia, 66 AD3d 699 [2009]).
In March 2010, the defendant moved for resentencing pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738), the Drug Law Reform Act of 2005 (L 2005, ch 643), and the Drug Law Reform Act of 2009 (CPL 440.46) (hereinafter collectively the DLRA). The County Court resentenced the defendant, pronouncing resentences for each count of both indictments, but without complying with the procedures specified in the DLRA, requiring the entry of initial orders specifying the proposed resentences. Consequently, this Court reversed the resentences and remitted the matter to the County Court for the entry of the initial DLRA orders specifying proposed resentences and informing the defendant that, unless he withdrew his motion or appealed from the initial DLRA orders, the County Court would enter orders vacating the sentences originally imposed and impose the proposed resentences (see People v Garcia, 107 AD3d 738 [2013]).
By order dated September 30, 2013, the County Court specified and informed the defendant that “it is the Court’s sentencing position that the defendant, upon resentence, should receive a determinate term of 17½ years plus 5 years post release supervision on each indictment to run consecutively.” While this pronouncement apparently refers to the class A-I felonies in each indictment, the court failed to specify its sentencing position with respect to the convictions of the class A-II felonies and the class B felonies under indictment No. 04-594.
Accordingly, the order must be reversed, and we again remit the matter to the County Court, Orange County, for the entry of initial DLRA orders for each indictment, specifying the proposed resentences for each count of each indictment and informing the defendant that, unless he withdraws his motion or appeals from the initial DLRA orders, the County Court will enter orders vacating the sentences originally imposed and imposing the proposed resentences (see People v Struss, 79 AD3d 773 [2010]).
The defendant’s remaining contention need not be reached in light of our determination.

"— Appeal by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Fisher, J.), both rendered December 14, 1989, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 7310/85, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree under Indictment No. 1351/86, upon his pleas of guilty; and imposing sentences.
Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.
At the time of his pleas of guilty, the defendant, a predicate felon, was warned by the court that if he did not appear for sentencing, the negotiated sentences of 4 Vi to 9 years might be increased to as much as 12 Vi to 25 years. The defendant absconded but was returned on a warrant three years later and was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 5 to 10 years. He now seeks to have his sentences vacated on the ground that they were imposed without the benefit of an updated presentence report (see, People v Sanchez, 143 AD2d 377; People v Jackson, 106 AD2d 93; People v Halaby, 77 AD2d 717).
The record shows that the probation department reinterviewed the defendant prior to sentencing and prepared and submitted to the court an addendum to the original presentence report. The information regarding his employment history and family situation that the defendant now claims was omitted from the addendum was brought to the court’s attention by defense counsel. In any event, the record makes clear that the one-half year increase in the sentence originally promised resulted from the defendant’s failure to appear for sentencing and not from any deficiency in the information possessed by the court. Accordingly, resentencing is not required. Mangano, P. J., Sullivan, Harwood and Miller, JJ., concur.",,299,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (Harrington, J.), rendered January 5, 1990, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment and the payment of $6,050 in restitution.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by vacating so much of the sentence as directed the defendant to make restitution; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
On November 2, 1989, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree in satisfaction of Indictment No. 61489, in exchange for a promised sentence of an indeterminate term of three years to life imprisonment. On January 5,1990, the promised sentence was imposed, but the defendant was further ordered to make restitution of unrecovered so-called ""buy money” in the amount of $6,050. It was improper for the court to order the defendant to pay restitution of the buy money (see, People v Rowe, 152 AD2d 907, affd 75 NY2d 948; People v Vigoya, 173 AD2d 582). Mangano, P.

"Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: On October 18, 1994, defendant was convicted in Niagara County Court following a jury trial of two drug-related felonies and one misdemeanor. On December 6, 1994, before sentencing on the above offenses, defendant pleaded guilty to another drug-related felony charged in a separate indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment for all four offenses and defendant waived his right to appeal from both judgments.
The record establishes that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal (see, People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 11), and that waiver forecloses our review of his contention regarding the severity of the sentences (see, People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 280-281; People v Pierce, 233 AD2d 872, lv denied 89 NY2d 945). The remaining contention of defendant, that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial on the first indictment, is an issue that survives the waiver of the right to appeal (see, People v Callahan, supra, at 280). The record establishes that Supreme Court issued an order converting a pro se habeas corpus petition to a motion under CPL 30.20 and 30.30 and directing that it be referred to County Court for determination. That order also relieved the counsel appointed on the habeas corpus petition, who was not the same counsel who was representing defendant in County Court. The first mention of the Supreme Court order in this record is in defendant’s posttrial motion pursuant to CPL article 440. Inasmuch as the speedy trial motion was never before County Court and thus was not ruled upon, there is no determination concerning it that can be reviewed on appeal.

Defendant’s primary claim on this appeal is that his plea of guilty to the above enumerated charges was induced by promises concerning his sentence which were not honored. This court has already determined that the trial ""court questioned the defendant in regard to any promises as to sentence and it was established that as a result of plea bargaining there had been an agreement as to the maximum sentence which would be imposed upon the plea of guilty” (People v Cunningham, 46 AD2d 709).

"Stein, J.
Appeal, by permission, from an order of the County Court of Cortland County (Campbell, J.), entered February 23, 2009, which denied defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, without a hearing.
Defendant, a citizen of St. Kitts-Nevis, was charged in an indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He pleaded guilty to that crime, waived his right to appeal and was sentenced to two years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision. Thereafter, as defendant’s conviction was related to a controlled substance, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commenced deportation proceedings against him (see 8 USC § 1227 [a] [2] [B] [i]). Defendant subsequently moved to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10, claiming that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because his attorney had assured him that pleading guilty would not expose him to deportation. After concluding that defendant’s ineffective assistance challenge did not impact the voluntariness of his plea and was thus precluded by the waiver of his right to appeal, County Court denied the motion without a hearing. With permission from this Court, defendant now appeals.
We reverse. Inasmuch as defendant asserts that he would not have pleaded guilty but for counsel’s representation that, doing so would not subject him to deportation, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim impacts the voluntariness of his plea and survives the waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Marshall, 66 AD3d 1115, 1116 [2009]), particularly in view of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Padilla v Kentucky (559 US —, 130 S Ct 1473 [2010]). Moreover, where a defendant can demonstrate prejudice — that he or she would not have entered the plea and would have insisted on going to trial absent counsel’s misadvice — such a claim may form the basis for vacating a plea (see People v McDonald, 1 NY3d 109, 114-115 [2003]). Here, the affidavit accompanying defendant’s motion indicates that he initially rejected the People’s plea offer, accepting it only after allegedly being assured by counsel several times that pleading guilty would not result in his deportation (cf. id. at 115). Notably, an affidavit submitted by defendant’s girlfriend supports his contention, suggesting that defendant repeatedly expressed reservations about pleading guilty if such a plea might lead him to being deported. According to her, she was present on at least four occasions when defense counsel stated that defendant would not be exposed to deportation proceedings due to his guilty plea. Under such circumstances, County Court should have conducted a hearing prior to deciding defendant’s CPL 440.10 motion (see People v Marshall, 66 AD3d at 1116; People v McKenzie, 4 AD3d 437, 438-440 [2004]; compare People v Argueta, 46 AD3d 46, 51 [2007], lv dismissed 10 NY3d 761 [2008]).

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Broomer, J.), rendered January 6, 1983, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.
Judgment modified, on the law, by vacating the sentence imposed on the conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. As so modified, judgment affirmed, and matter remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for resentencing on that conviction.
The sentence of 4½ to 12 years, which the sentence minutes indicate was imposed by Criminal Term on the defendant’s conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, is not a permissible sentence for the defendant, a second felony offender convicted of a class B felony (see, Penal Law § 70.06). It is apparent from the record that the court may have misspoken in rendering this sentence and that it may have intended to impose the minimum sentence permitted, 4½ to 9 years. The order of commitment in fact states that such a sentence was imposed. In view of this discrepancy, we cannot determine what sentence the court intended and therefore the sentence in question must be vacated and the matter remitted to Criminal Term for resentencing on that charge (see, People v Ortiz, 116 AD2d 598; People v Aponte, 110 AD2d 901).

"— Appeal by defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the County Court, Orange County (Ingrassia, J.), imposed January 18, 1980, after a plea of guilty, upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, the sentence being an indeterminate term of imprisonment of six years to life. Defendant also purports to appeal from an order of the same court dated February 2, 1981, which denied his motion for resentencing. Sentence affirmed. Appeal from the order dated February 2, 1981, dismissed. On November 13, 1979 defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, in violation of section 220.41 of the Penal Law. The incident to which he pleaded guilty involved the sale of cocaine and occurred on January 19, 1979. On January 18, 1980, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years to life. His subsequent application to have the court vacate his plea (CPL 440.10) or, in the alternative, to be resentenced (Penal Law, § 60.09) was denied. On appeal defendant only questions his sentence. Because the crime for which he was convicted occurred prior to September 1, 1979, the effective date of the 1979 amendments to this State’s drug laws (L 1979, ch 410, § 29), the statutory range of defendant’s sentence was from six years to life up to eight and a third to life (Penal Law, § 70.00, subd 3, par [a], cl [ii]). He received the minimum permissible sentence, and therefore there is no excessive sentence issue for this court to decide. Defendant was eligible on his application for resentencing to receive a reduction of his sentence to as low a term as three years to life (Penal Law, § 60.09, subd b, par [ii]). The sentencing court’s exercise of discretion in denying a motion for resentence under section 60.09 of the Penal Law is not subject to review (People v De Jesus, 54 NY2d 447; People v Stephens, 55 NY2d 778; Matter of Watson v Thorp, 89 AD2d 918).

"— Adjudication unanimously modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, to the extent of reducing the sentence, imposed to a term of five years’ probation, and otherwise adjudication affirmed and matter remitted to Supreme Court, Erie County, to fix the conditions of probation pursuant to Penal Law § 65.10. Memorandum: On defendant’s plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.39), the court granted defendant youthful offender status and sentenced him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years. Under the unusually compelling circumstances of this case, we believe that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of our discretion in the interest of justice.
Defendant and his sister (People v Luann R., 119 AD2d 992) became involved with drugs when their mother invited the son of a close friend into their home in a misguided attempt to change his drug-related life-style through the good influence of her children. Unfortunately, the influence was in the opposite direction, ultimately resulting in the conviction of both of her children for the sale of controlled substances.
The events underlying the convictions herein took place over a period of several months when defendant was 17 to 18 years old, his sister 21. Neither had been in any trouble before; indeed, both were very industrious and had held jobs while attending school. Defendant became addicted to cocaine and acted as a courier in order to support his own drug needs. After his arrest, defendant entered a drug detoxification program, purged himself of his addiction and obtained a responsible position. Similarly, after her arrest Luann successfully completed Erie Community College. Both defendants cooperated fully with the authorities and there seems little doubt that they have "" 'demonstrated an ability to conform to socially acceptable standards of behavior’ ” (People v Haussman, 105 AD2d 623).

Memorandum: At the time defendant entered his plea of guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (Penal Law § 220.31), the People agreed to recommend that he be sentenced to shock probation. After reviewing the presentence report, however, the District Attorney declined to make such a recommendation. Defendant rejected County Court’s offer to allow him to withdraw his plea and proceed on the original charge, even after being advised that the court was inclined to impose an indeterminate term of incarceration of 2V3 to 7 years. Defendant did not request an adjournment to consider the court’s offer and thus has failed to preserve for our review his present contention that the court erred in failing to adjourn the matter for that purpose (see, CPL 470.05 [2]). The court did""not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum possible sentence, which is not unduly harsh or severe.

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County, rendered December 21, 1976, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth and sixth degrees, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence as a second felony offender. The defendant further purports to appeal from an order of the same court, dated December 23, 1977, which denied his motion pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside his sentence. We deem the defendant’s brief to include a motion to reargue a previous order of this court, dated May 9, 1978, which denied his application for leave to appeal from the order of December 23, 1977. Judgment affirmed. No opinion. Motion for reargument granted and, upon reargument, order dated May 9, 1978 vacated and leave to appeal from the order of December 23, Í977, is granted by Presiding Justice Mollen. Order reversed, on the law, motion granted, defendant’s sentence vacated, and case remitted to the County Court for resentencing consistent herewith. Upon his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth and sixth degrees, the defendant was adjudged a second felony offender and was sentenced accordingly. His second felony offender status was predicated upon a criminal prosecution in Texas. In that case, the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of marihuana. Instead of imposing a term of imprisonment, however, the court suspended sentence and placed the defendant on probation pursuant to section 3 of article 42.12 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. That statute provides: “The judges of the courts of the State of Texas having original jurisdiction of criminal actions, when it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public as well as the defendant will be subserved thereby, shall have the power, after conviction or a plea of guilty for any crime or offense, where the maximum punishment assessed against the defendant does not exceed ten years imprisonment, to suspend the imposition of the sentence and may place the defendant on probation or impose a fine applicable to the offense committed and also place the defendant on probation as hereinafter provided. In all cases where the punishment is assessed by the Court it may fix the period of probation without regard to the term of punishment assessed, but in no event may the period of probation be greater than 10 years or less than the minimum prescribed for the offense for which the defendant was convicted. Any such person placed on probation, whether in a trial by jury or before the court, shall be under the supervision of such court.” Subsequent to the imposition of sentence in the case at bar, the defendant successfully applied to the Texas courts for relief pursuant to section 7 of article 42.12 of the Texas Code, which provides: “At any time, after the defendant has satisfactorily completed one-third of the original probationary period or two years of probation, whichever is the lesser, the period of probation may be reduced or terminated by the court. Upon the satisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of probation, and the expiration of the period of probation, the court, by order duly entered, shall amend or modify the original sentence imposed, if necessary, to conform to the probation period and shall discharge the defendant. In case the defendant has been convicted or has entered a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere, and the court has discharged the defendant hereunder, such court may set aside the verdict or permit the defendant to withdraw his plea, and shall dismiss the accusation, complaint, information or indictment against such defendant, who shall thereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of which he has been convicted or to which he has pleaded guilty, except that proof of his said conviction or plea of guilty shall be made known to the court should the defendant again be convicted of any criminal offense.” (Emphasis supplied.) As a result, the defendant’s guilty plea in the Texas case was withdrawn and the indictment against him was dismissed. He then moved, pursuant to CPL 440.20, to vacate his sentence in the case at bar and to be resentenced as a first felony offender. The County Court denied his application (see People v Willis, 93 Misc 2d 657). We reverse. The defendant here did not merely receive a suspended sentence. (Cf. Penal Law, § 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [iii].) His guilty plea was withdrawn and the indictment against him was dismissed. By operation of Texas law, he was thereby released “from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the * * * crime * * * to which he * * * pleaded guilty.” Although the Texas statute permits the fact of the guilty plea to be made known to the court in the event the defendant is again convicted of a criminal offense, Texas courts have held that the statute bars the use of the plea for purposes of mandatory enhancement of punishment upon a subsequent conviction. (See Matter of Murchison, 560 SW2d 654 [Tex].) In view of the interpretation given by the State of Texas to its own statute, we hold that, upon the withdrawal of the defendant’s guilty plea and the dismissal of the indictment against him, he reverted to the status of a first felony offender. (See People v Bell, 82 Misc 2d 1021; cf. People v Slepinski, 54 AD2d 202.) Accordingly, his sentence must be vacated and the case remitted for appropriate resentence. (Cf. People v Turner, 29 AD2d 829.) Mollen, P. J., Hopkins, Titone and Weinstein, JJ., concur. [93 Misc 2d 657.]",,955,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Owen, J.), rendered June 14, 1985, convicting him of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument, and unlawful possession of marihuana, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
We find no merit to the defendant’s contention that the court improperly permitted him to withdraw his guilty plea. The record reveals that his plea of guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, the court told the defendant that it would consider a sentence of five years’ probation and six months in the county jail if, upon receiving his criminal history, that sentence was appropriate, The People thereafter served a predicate felony statement which reflected two prior convictions in Massachusetts of ""[a]ssault and battery [by means of a] dangerous weapon” (Mass Annot Laws ch 265, § 15A). When the defendant appeared for sentencing, the court informed him that as a second felony offender, the minimum sentence the court could legally impose was 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment, and offered the defendant leave to withdraw the plea. The defendant accepted the offer.
Upon learning of the defendant’s criminal history and believing that it could not legally impose the proposed sentence, the court properly afforded him the opportunity to withdraw his plea and thereby restore himself to the position he was in before the plea was taken. The court was required to do no more (see, People v Schultz, 73 NY2d 757; People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227; People v Hofmann, 151 AD2d 604). Having failed to challenge the second felony offender statement, the defendant cannot now be heard to argue that he erroneously relied upon it in withdrawing his plea. In any event, given the defendant’s lengthy criminal history, even if, as he maintains, the two convictions listed in the statement do not constitute predicate felonies under New York law, it does not necessarily follow that the court would have imposed the proposed sentence of probation and six months’ incarceration (see, People v Selikoff, supra).
We have examined the defendant’s remaining contentions and find that they do not warrant reversal of his conviction or a reduction in his sentence. Mangano, P. J., Thompson, Bracken and Rubin, JJ., concur.",,403,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v. Eone Chapman, Appellant",Controlled Substance Possession (2),Sentencing,Criminal Law,People v.

"—Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Pesce, J.), imposed August 27, 1990, the sentence being an indeterminate term of IVz years to life imprisonment, upon his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, after a plea of guilty.
Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.
The defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and numerous lesser crimes involving the possession and sale of drugs. On April 25, 1988, he pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, as charged in count 25 of the indictment, to cover the indictment. The defendant was told that he would be sentenced to an indeterminate term of four years to life imprisonment. He was also told that if he were to fail to appear for sentencing, he would be subject to the maximum sentence. The defendant’s attorney stated to the court, ""I believe [the maximum] is six and a third to life”. The court then stated to the defendant, ""[i]f you [were to fail] to return [for sentencing] you would then receive six and a third to [life]”.
The defendant did not appear for sentencing. More than two years later, after having been arrested for another drug offense, the defendant finally appeared. His attorney did not allege that the court was obliged to impose a sentence of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment, and in fact requested that the court impose a sentence of 7 years to life imprisonment. The court then imposed a sentence of 7 Vi years to life imprisonment.
On the present appeal pursuant to 22 NYCRR 670.12 (c) (1), the defendant does not seek to have his plea of guilty vacated. Instead, he argues that the sentencing court had a duty to impose a term of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment (see, People v Outlaw, 157 AD2d 677; People v Marrero, 162 AD2d 419; People v Gallino, 131 AD2d 695). We disagree.
The defendant had no unqualified right to receive a term of 6 Vs years to life imprisonment. Instead, the defendant had the right to choose either to withdraw his guilty plea or to submit to whatever sentence the court, in its discretion, wished to impose (see, e.g., People v Scrivens, 175 AD2d 671; People v Outlaw, supra; People v White, 144 AD2d 711; People v Sumner, 137 AD2d 891; People v Gallino, supra; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709). Because the defendant does not seek to withdraw his guilty plea now, and has never sought that relief in the court of original instance, and because the defendant’s attorney affirmatively requested the imposition of a prison term which exceeded any prior commitment which had been made by the court, we conclude that the defendant may not invoke the rule defined in the cases cited above in order to compel the imposition of a sentence which, in view of his having absconded, and in view of his having been rearrested on another charge, would be inappropriate. We agree with the Supreme Court that, under all the circumstances of this case, any sentence less than that actually imposed would have been inappropriate. Accordingly, the sentence appealed from is affirmed. Mangano, P. J., Bracken, Balletta, O’Brien and Copertino, JJ., concur.",,579,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v.

"Per Curiam.
Defendant was sentenced to 15 years to life as a fourth-felony offender. No one concerned with the plea, neither the Judge, the District Attorney, nor the defendant’s lawyer, knew at the time of plea defendant would thereby become a fourth-felony offender, greatly increasing the mandatory sen tence, nor did the defendant know the legal status and magnitude of his earlier convictions.
As a matter of law, then, it appears from the testimony at the hearing that there was a mutual mistake of fact and law in the giving and acceptance of defendant’s plea to felony. With the low level of defendant’s education, his tubercular condition at the time, and the willingness of the prosecutor to accept a lesser plea on the assumption that defendant was not a fourth offender, it is manifest the plea was not given or accepted with knowledge of the relevant circumstances. (Cf. Jones v. United States, 440 F. 2d 466.)
On the appeal in the criminal action, the order should be reversed, the sentence vacated and defendant permitted to withdraw the plea of guilty to attempt to possess narcotics with intent to sell taken May 26, 1965.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (Greller, J.), rendered December 1, 2011, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by vacating the sentence imposed; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and the matter is remitted to the County Court, Dutchess County, for further proceedings in accordance herewith.
The defendant’s argument that the County Court misapprehended, and therefore, failed to impose, the promised period of postrelease supervision is unpreserved for appellate review (see CEL 470.05 [2]).

"—Appeal from a judgment of Onondaga County Court (Fahey, J.), entered May 21, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.
It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed.
Memorandum: Defendant contends that County Court deprived him of his right to due process in imposing an enhanced sentence upon determining that he had violated the conditions of his release pending sentencing. We reject that contention. At the time of his plea of guilty, defendant agreed to cooperate with police investigations pending sentencing, and the court advised defendant that, if he was “involved in any new criminal conduct, particularly [an] other drug offense,” it would not be bound by the sentence promise of a term of imprisonment of 4 to 8 years. At sentencing, the prosecutor advised the court that defendant had been arrested a few days before sentencing for “conducting street level drug sales.” The prosecutor further stated that a sale had been observed by a police officer and that at least one of the buyers had advised the police that he had purchased drugs from defendant. Defense counsel advised the court that the buyer at issue had recanted his statement. Defendant admitted that he possessed crack cocaine but contended that he “was in temporary innocent possession” of it. At defendant’s request, the court conducted an off-the-record discussion with defense counsel with respect to defendant’s explanation of the events. The court then determined that defendant was not authorized to possess the crack cocaine and imposed an enhanced term of imprisonment of 6 to 12 years. We conclude that the court’s inquiry was “of sufficient depth * * * so that the court [could] be satisfied * * * of the existence of a legitimate basis for the arrest on [the] charge” (People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713) and that it properly assured “itself that the information upon which it base[d] the sentence [was] reliable and accurate” (id. at 712; cf.

"Judgment insofar as it imposes sentence upon defendant unanimously reversed on the law, sentence vacated, and matter remitted to Monroe County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: The defendant pleaded guilty to attempted burglary in the third degree in Monroe County Court on October 23, 1970. At sentencing, appellant asked the court to have him examined by a doctor regarding his drug addiction. In refusing this request the sentencing court stated “ that there is no indication that you are an addict at this time.” This was error. The court had before it a probation report containing evidence of narcotics usage by the defendant. The report also contained references to narcotics used by defendant and suggested that the crime for which defendant was charged was committed to support a narcotics habit. Subdivision 1 of section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides that “ Every person * * * who, while in custody or when he appears before the court, shall state, indicate or show symptoms, or it otherwise appears, that he is a narcotics addict, shall undergo a medical examination to determine whether he is a narcotics addict.” Upon this record an examination and a finding concerning defendant’s status as an addict are required. He should, therefore, be resentenced in accordance with the procedures mandated by sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law and section 60.15 of the Penal Law (People v.

"Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County, rendered December 16, 1971, convicting him of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fifth degree, upon his plea of guilty, and sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term not to exceed three years. Judgment affirmed. Although no medical examination was conducted to determine whether defendant was a narcotic addict, in our opinion, under the circumstances herein, strict and literal compliance with sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law was unnecessary. As indicated by the probation report which was before the court at the time of sentencing, defendant had a long history of drug-related arrests and convictions. He had previously been certified to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission pursuant to section 210 of the Mental Hygiene Law and had been released from that custody to aftercare only two weeks prior to his arrest on the instant charge. It is perfectly clear that there was a tacit understanding by all parties concerned during these proceedings that defendant was an addict. At the sentencing, defense counsel, in essence, requested that defendant be returned to the custody of the commission. The court, in so many words, responded that such a disposition had previously been unsuccessful and that the court therefore believed that a prison sentence was in order. Thus, the record amply demonstrates that defendant was addicted and that the sentencing court considered defendant’s request for treatment (People v. Carter, 31 N Y 2d 964; cf. People v. Maranez, 31 N Y 2d 828). We have considered and rejected defendant’s other contentions. Hopkins, Acting P.

"— Appeal by the defendant (1) from a judgment of the County Court, Westchester County (Colabella, J.), rendered December 12, 1986, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence, and (2) from an amended judgment of the same court (Rosato, J.), rendered March 11, 1987, revoking a sentence of probation previously imposed by the same court, upon a finding that he had violated a condition thereof, after his admission, and imposing a sentence of imprisonment upon his previous conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and driving while impaired.
Ordered that the judgment and amended judgment are affirmed.
On December 12, 1986, the defendant was sentenced to 3 to 6 years’ imprisonment, on his plea of guilty to the charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class C felony (see, Penal Law § 220.34). The sentence imposed was the minimum available under law for a second felony offender (see, Penal Law § 70.06 [3] [c]; [4] [b]). The defendant’s claim that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional as applied is meritless.
The defendant makes no argument in his brief specifically addressed to the sentence imposed in connection with the amended judgment rendered on March 11, 1987. In any event, we find that that sentence was fully appropriate under all the circumstances. Mollen, P.

"Appeal from a judgment of Oswego County Court (Haiher, Jr., J.), entered August 16, 2001, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts).
It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed.
Memorandum: Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law § 220.39 [1]) in exchange for a sentence commitment of a term of imprisonment of 4x/2 to 9 years. County Court advised defendant that it would not be bound by its sentencing promise if he was arrested before sentencing. Defendant was in fact arrested, and the court scheduled a hearing to determine whether there was a legitimate basis for the arrest (see People v Outley, 80 NY2d 702, 713). The prosecutor and defense counsel advised the court of the circumstances of defendant’s arrest and their respective positions regarding its legitimacy. The prosecutor sought an enhanced sentence of 10 to 20 years. As a result of further negotiations, defendant was permitted to plead guilty to a superior court information (SCI) charging him with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (§ 220.16 [1]) in connection with the arrest pending sentencing. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to concurrent terms of 7 to 14 years on each of the two counts and on the SCI. Defendant waived his right to appeal with respect to both pleas of guilty, and those waivers encompass his contention that the sentences are unduly harsh and severé (see People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737; People v Young, 281 AD2d 950, 950-951, lv denied 96 NY2d 909). In any event, that contention lacks merit.
We reject the further contention of defendant that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to proceed with an Outley hearing, the outcome of which may have altered his decision to plead guilty to the SCI. “In the context of a guilty plea, a defendant has been afforded meaningful representation when he * * * receives an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel” (People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404). The court was not required to conduct a hearing, and here defendant was properly afforded an “opportunity to show that the arrest [was] without foundation” (Outley, 80 NY2d at 713). Defense counsel successfully negotiated lesser enhanced sentences than those sought by the People and obtained an advantageous plea agreement on the SCI.
The waiver by defendant of the right to appeal with respect to the first plea of guilty encompasses his present challenge to the factual sufficiency of that plea allocution (see People v DeJesus, 248 AD2d 1023, lv denied 92 NY2d 878). In any event, defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction and thus failed to preserve his contention for our review (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665). Defendant also failed to preserve for our review his contention that his first plea of guilty was not knowing and voluntary (see id.) and, in any event, that contention lacks merit.

Ordered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing the defendant’s conviction to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
Prior to the acceptance of his plea of guilty, the defendant withdrew all of his pretrial motions, decided and undecided alike. Thus, he may not raise on appeal the issues proffered in those motions (see, People v Williams, 36 NY2d 829, cert denied 423 US 873; People v Colarusso, 103 AD2d 848).
As part of the negotiated plea bargain, it was agreed that the defendant would plead guilty to a class A-II felony and receive a sentence of an indeterminate term of eight years to life imprisonment. The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, which is a class A-I felony (see, Penal Law §§ 220.21, 110.05 [1]). A sentence of eight years to life imprisonment constitutes an illegally low term of imprisonment for an A-I felony (see, Penal Law § 70.00 [3] [a] [i]). At the plea proceeding, the parties were under the mistaken impression that the crime of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was a class A-II felony which would permit the imposition of the agreed-upon sentence. On appeal, the defendant contends that his conviction should be reduced to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which is a class AII felony, and the People contend that his conviction should be reduced to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, which is also a class A-II felony.
Under these circumstances, the conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree should be reduced, in the interest of justice, to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree (Penal Law § 220.18), in order to better effectuate the clear purpose and intent of the plea agreement (see, People v Laino, 186 AD2d 226; People v Brown, 147 AD2d 489). Moreover, since the sentence imposed upon the defendant’s plea was the sentence promised, no purpose would be served by remitting the matter for resentencing. Accordingly, we leave the sentence undisturbed (see, People v Laino, supra, at 226-227; People v Brown, supra, at 490; People v Martinez, 116 AD2d 743). Bracken, J.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Firetog, J.), rendered September 13, 1994, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
On February 3, 1994, the defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree to cover the indictment. He was promised a sentence of two to four years imprisonment, ""concurrent with the time you are now serving”. On February 14, 1994, he received the promised sentence.
By letter dated April 4,1994, the Department of Correctional Services informed the sentencing court that the sentence was illegal under Penal Law § 70.25 (2-a). On June 13,1994, the defendant appeared before the sentencing court, who informed him that ""we imposed an illegal sentence”, and gave the defendant the option of being resentenced to two to four years imprisonment to run consecutive to his prior sentence, or withdrawing his plea and going to trial. The defendant did not object to that procedure and chose to withdraw his guilty plea.
On this appeal from the judgment of conviction rendered after trial, the defendant contends that the court improperly vacated his guilty plea. His contentions are unpreserved for appellate review (see, CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, the court’s power to correct an illegal sentence within one year after the sentence was imposed is well recognized in statutory and case law (see, People v Wright, 56 NY2d 613; People v Ford, 143 AD2d 522; People v Smith, 164 Misc 2d 306; CPL 440.40 [1]; cf., People v Riggins, 164 AD2d 797). In the instant case, where the defendant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would receive a sentence which the court and the parties later ascertained was illegal, the court was obligated to give the defendant the option to withdraw his plea as an alternative to imposing a legal sentence (see, People v Ford, supra). That the defendant chose an option which ultimately proved disadvantageous to him is not a ground for reversal.
The defendant’s claim that his counsel was ineffective cannot be determined on this record (see, e.g., People v Langhorne, 177 AD2d 713). Mangano, P.

"— Judgment unanimously reversed, motion to withdraw plea granted, and matter remitted to Orleans County Court for further proceedings on the indictment. Memorandum: Defendant was charged with one count of criminally selling a controlled substance, second degree, and one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance, third degree. After jury selection had started, defendant agreed to plead guilty to two counts of selling in the third degree. At the request of the District Attorney the plea hearing was conducted in the presence of the jury panel and produced defendant’s version that, at the urging of two acquaintances (at the sentencing these were identified as undercover police agents) he went from Albion to Rochester and obtained heroin for them. Defendant stated that he pleaded guilty after conferring with counsel and that he was satisfied with his legal representation. He did, however, state that his plea was not voluntary but done upon the advice of counsel. There is no reference in the record to what was said, if anything, as to the possible sentence that he might receive. When the court asked defendant if any promises had been made to him, defendant responded, ""Well, they say if I cooperate with the authorities — ”. Before defendant finished his sentence, the court stated, ""You promise to cooperate with the authorities, is that correct?” The court opened the sentencing hearing by instructing defendant on the law of agency (see People v Lindsey, 16 AD2d 805, affd 12 NY2d 958; People v Branch, 13 AD2d 714) because it ""should have mentioned” it at the time of pleading. In view of the subsequent denial of defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the court’s purpose in giving this instruction is not entirely clear. Defendant then moved to withdraw his plea, stating that he was innocent, that he acted only as an agent of the buyers, that he had been ""rushed” to plead and that he had pleaded guilty not voluntarily or understanding^ but upon the ""advice” of counsel (see People v Bowers, 45 AD2d 241, 243-244; and cf. People v Dixon, 29 NY2d 55) and without understanding the possible sentence. He stated that at the time of pleading his wife was in the hospital undergoing serious kidney surgery. His counsel stated that he had explained the penalty that could be imposed by the court but ""I don’t know that it was explained clear enough.” The lawyer then urged the court to put defendant on probation. Defendant was a migrant worker who had come to the Albion area about 12 years earlier. He was married with a child, steadily employed by Lipton Company, owned his own home and had no prior arrests or convictions. The permissible mandatory minimum sentence on each count was one to eight and one-third years. The court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment having a mandatory minimum of eight and one-third years and a maximum of life, precisely the maximum sentence that defendant could have received if found guilty as charged after trial and without his promise to co-operate with the authorities. While no set formula is mandated in taking a plea of guilty, the court must take care before doing so to determine that defendant has in fact committed a crime and that he appreciates the consequences of his plea and the possible penal sanctions which may be imposed upon him as a result (People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338, 345; People v Woods, 50 AD2d 720). This is particularly so in cases such as this where the court contemplates the maximum sentence possible after trial and when the sentence is severe. The ""bargain” then becomes little more than an occasion whereby defendant throws himself on the mercy of the court and he should do so only with a full appreciation of the court’s intentions.

"—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (Vaughn, J.), rendered December 15, 1992, convicting him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
As part of the plea agreement, the defendant was promised a sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment. However, at defense counsel’s suggestion, both the court and the prosecution agreed that if the defendant was able to repay the $3,600 that he had obtained from the police in connection with the charged drug sales he would receive a lesser sentence of 4 years to life imprisonment. Since the defendant was unable to produce the $3,600, the court imposed the promised sentence of 5 years to life imprisonment.
We reject the defendant’s contention that his sentence is excessive or that the court unconstitutionally imposed a greater sentence because the defendant is indigent (see generally, Bearden v Georgia, 461 US 660; Tate v Short, 401 US 395). Rather, the record clearly reflects that the defendant simply received the bargained-for sentence and that he was unable to take advantage of an opportunity to lessen his sentence. That being the case, he has no basis to complain about the sentence that was imposed (see, People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816). Thompson, J.

"Judgment insofar as it imposes sentence upon defendant unanimously reversed, sentence vacated and matter remitted to Erie County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery in the third degree in Erie County Court on April 8, 1970 and on May 4, 1970 was sentenced to the custody of the Department of Correction for an indeterminate term of not more than seven years. At the time of the sentencing, when defendant was asked if there was any legal cause to show why he should not be sentenced, his counsel stated that defendant was a drug addict, that he did not know if defendant had been investigated concerning narcotics, but that he wanted to inform the court of the situation. The court also had before it a probation report recommending such an examination. Section 207 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides in part that “Every person * * * who, while in custody or when he appears before -the court, shall state, indicate or show symptoms, or it otherwise appears, that he is a narcotic addict, shall undergo a medical examination to determine whether he is a narcotic addict.” However, the court disregarded the information about narcotics and sentenced defendant without a medical examination. An examination and finding concerning defendant’s status as an addict is required, and he should be regentenced in accordance with the procedures mandated by sections 207 and 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law.

"— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Richmond County (Felig, J.), rendered October 20, 1988, convicting her of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon her plea of guilty, and sentencing her to an indeterminate term of 1 Vi to 4 Vi years’ imprisonment.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the court improperly imposed a greater sentence than that which had been promised was not preserved for appellate review as she did not object nor did she move to vacate her plea (see, People v Belsito, 130 AD2d 583; People v Polanksy, 125 AD2d 342; People v Ifill, 108 AD2d 202). In any event, the court had clearly conditioned the promised sentence upon, inter alla, the defendant’s cooperation with the Probation Department. The defendant failed to fulfill that condition and the proffered explanation for such failure was vague, unsubstantiated and insufficient (see, People v Asencio, 143 AD2d 917).
We find that the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. A review of the record shows that acceptance of the plea offer greatly reduced the defendant’s sentencing exposure. In advising the defendant to accept that offer, her attorney afforded her meaningful representation and thereby satisfied the constitutional requirements (see, People v Satterfield, 66 NY2d 796; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137; People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705; People v Saggese, 135 AD2d 669, 670; People v Hidalgo, 120 AD2d 675). Defense counsel’s failure to move to withdraw the defendant’s plea or to object to the enhanced sentence cannot be characterized as ineffective assistance of counsel since vacatur of the plea would have exposed the defendant to a substantially greater period of incarceration if she were convicted under the original charges.

"Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Richmond County (Kuffner, J.), rendered April 7, 1989, convicting her of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon her plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
The defendant’s contention that the court improperly imposed a greater sentence than that which had been promised was not preserved for appellate review as she neither objected to the sentence as violative of the sentence commitment nor moved to vacate her plea (see, People v Moore, 155 AD2d 696; People v Ifill, 108 AD2d 202). In any event, a review of the record discloses that the original plea agreement was modified, with the consent and knowledge of the defendant and the prosecutor, at a subsequent hearing on the defendant’s application to be released on her own recognizance pending sentence, in order to enable her to visit her gravely ill sister and to begin a drug rehabilitation program. Bail had been previ ously set at $10,000. In determining the application, the court properly considered, pursuant to CPL 510.30 (2) (a), alternative ""kind[s] and degreefs] of control or restriction” that were necessary to secure the defendant’s attendance at sentence. To accomplish this purpose, the court clearly conditioned the promised sentence, inter alia, upon the defendant’s appearance on the date scheduled for sentencing and upon her cooperation with a T.A.S.C. (Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) caseworker, including her enrollment and attendance in a drug rehabilitation program. The defendant acknowledged that she understood that if she did not comply with these conditions, the court would impose a harsher sentence than that promised in consideration of her plea of guilty. Thereafter, the defendant failed to fulfill either condition and she was arrested on a bench warrant. The proffered explanation for her noncompliance was incredible, unsubstantiated and insufficient. Accordingly, the court was free to impose a more severe sentence, which was not excessive (see, People v Moore, supra; People v Caridi, 148 AD2d 625; People v Betheny, 147 AD2d 488; People v Raife, 146 AD2d 652; cf., People v Rosenberg, 148 AD2d 346; People v Clarke, 145 AD2d 565; People v Annunziata, 105 AD2d 709; see also, Innes v Dalsheim, 864 F2d 974).
